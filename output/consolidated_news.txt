ByIan Sayson ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Aboitiz InfraCapital owns and operates the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. BlackRock will buy 40% of Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ privately held infrastructure unit, bolstering Aboitiz InfraCapital’s financial muscle as it steps up spending to modernize the country’s infrastructure. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s wholly owned unit, and Aboitiz Equity are in “the process of finalizing a strategic partnership,” the Philippine conglomerate said in a statement, without disclosing the amount of the potential sale. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in October, has over $183 billion in assets under management. It has interests in energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water utility and waste management sectors. “The Philippines has compelling growth prospects, which can be further enhanced by developing world-class infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of GIP, said. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to become a strategic partner of the Aboitiz Group.” The Philippine government aims to double infrastructure spending to at least 2 trillion pesos ($35 billion) by 2028 from 1 trillion this year as it accelerates projects such as the 33-kilometer Metro Manila subway that’s estimated to cost 489 billion pesos to build. Aboitiz Equity—the publicly traded holding company of tycoon Sabin Aboitiz and his family—has been scaling up its infrastructure investments in recent years. It has interests in airports, power plants, industrial estates, telecommunications towers and water utilities. Shares of Aboitiz Equity gained 2.3% in late afternoon trading in Manila. “We are honored to explore this opportunity with Global Infrastructure Partners,” Sabin Aboitiz, CEO and president of the conglomerate said. “Together, we aim to deliver projects that improve lives and empower communities.” Aboitiz InfraCapital swung to a 207 million loss in the first quarter even as sales jumped 53% to 2.4 billion pesos amid soaring finance charges on the company’s mounting debt levels. Its total borrowings almost tripled to 45.3 billion pesos as of end-2024 from a year ago. Aside from infrastructure, Aboitiz Equity has interests in banking, financial services, food manufacturing, and real estate. With an estimated net worth of $2.2 billion, the Aboitiz family is among the wealthiest in the Philippines.

July 24, 2025 02:55 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, July 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs, a leader in thematic and leveraged exchange-traded funds, today announced the launch of a new innovative ETF: the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF (Ticker: JPX). JPX provides investors with amplified 2X daily exposure to the performance of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), empowering retail investors to capitalize on high-growth opportunities in the financial services without the need for a margin account. JPX seeks to deliver daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the daily performance of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a global financial powerhouse known for its leadership in banking, asset management, and investment services. JPX utilizes derivatives such as swaps and options to achieve its leveraged objectives, offering precise exposure to these dynamic companies. "JPX represents Defiance's continued commitment to pioneering leveraged ETFs that give investors amplified access to transformative companies," said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. "JPMorgan's dominance in financial innovation makes JPX a timely addition to our lineup, allowing active investors to pursue high-growth strategies in resilient sectors." Why JPMorgan Chase & Co.?JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a cornerstone of the global economy, with a market-leading position in consumer banking, corporate & investment banking, and asset & wealth management. As digital transformation accelerates in finance, JPM continues to innovate with fintech integrations, blockchain applications, and sustainable investing initiatives, positioning it for sustained growth amid economic shifts. An investment in JPX is not an investment in JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Security’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Security’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. About DefianceFounded in 2018, Defiance is at the forefront of ETF innovation. Defiance is a leading ETF issuer specializing in thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs. Our first-mover leveraged single-stock ETFs empower investors to take amplified positions in high-growth companies, providing precise leverage exposure without the need to open a margin account. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund's investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC ("Tidal" or the "Adviser"). Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund's investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment. JPM Risks. The Funds invest in swap contracts and options that are based on the share prices of JPM. This subjects the Funds to the risk that the respective share prices decrease. If the share price of JPM decreases, the Funds will likely lose value and, as a result, the Funds may suffer significant losses. Therefore, as a result of the Funds' exposure to the values of JPM, the Funds may also be subject to the following risks: Underlying Securities Trading Risk. The trading prices of JPM may be highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. Underlying Securities Performance Risk. JPM may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause its share price to decline. Financial Services Industry Risk (JPX). The financial services industry can be significantly affected by regulatory changes, economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, and competitive pressures. Derivatives Risks. The Funds' derivative investments carry risks such as an imperfect match between the derivative's performance and its underlying assets, and the potential for loss of principal, which can exceed the initial investment. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Leverage Risk. As part of the Funds' principal investment strategy, the Funds will make investments in swap contracts and options. These derivative instruments provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure to the Underlying Securities, as well as the potential for greater loss. Compounding Risk. The Funds have a single day investment objective, and performance for any other period is the result of compounding daily returns for each trading day. The effects of compounding will likely cause the performance of a Fund to be either greater than or less than the Underlying Security's performance times the stated multiple in the Fund's investment objective, before accounting for fees and fund expenses. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Funds' expenses and reduce performance. Frequent trading may also cause adverse tax consequences for investors in the Funds due to an increase in short-term capital gains. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Funds are non-diversified, they may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if they were diversified funds. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Additionally, the Fund will seek to employ its investment strategy as it relates to the underlying issuer regardless of whether there are significant corporate actions such as restructurings, enforcement activity, or acquisitions or periods adverse market, economic, or other conditions and will not seek to take temporary defensive positions during such periods. New Fund Risk. As newly formed funds, they have no operating history, providing a limited basis for investors to assess performance or management. Brokerage commissions may be charged on trades.

Title: Alphabet boosted by AI, cloud demand as spending needs skyrocket
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/24/alphabet-boosted-by-ai-cloud-demand-as-spending-needs-skyrocket/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T06:32:31Z
Full Content:
Alphabet said demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products boosted quarterly sales, and now requires an extreme increase in capital spending – heightening pressure on the company to justify the cost of keeping up in the AI race. Google’s parent company said 2025 capital expenditures will be $85 billion (€72 billion), or $10 billion greater than an earlier forecast. Although Alphabet beat expectations for second-quarter revenue and profit, its stock initially sank in after-hours trading, then rebounded after chief executive Sundar Pichai explained that the investments are necessary in order to keep up with customer needs. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers,” he said on a call Wednesday following the report. As Microsoft, start-up OpenAI, Meta Platforms and others continue to pour money into AI, Alphabet has little choice but to follow suit, analysts said. The race is particularly urgent for Google: competitors are building chatbots that may eventually appeal to consumers more than its flagship search product. “Google’s hand is forced by OpenAI to spend tremendously on AI’s infrastructure and applications,” said Nikhil Lai, an analyst at Forrester. The recent quarter was strong almost across the board for Alphabet. Sales, excluding partner payouts, climbed to $81.7 billion, Alphabet said in a statement, topping analysts’ projections of $79.6 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Alphabet is counting on its core search advertising juggernaut and growing cloud computing business to support its spiralling spending on AI. Employees are under pressure to bring AI products to market faster, from new modes of search to tools for cloud customers. “We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai said. Chief financial officer Anat Ashkenazi said capital expenditures will rise yet again next year, without providing details. The strain of the AI race could be spotted elsewhere in the company’s results. Ashkenazi attributed the company’s 16% jump in spending on research and development to increases in pay packages for key employees. Meta has been making unprecedented compensation offers as it seeks to woo researchers for its superintelligence lab, driving up the price for key employees across the industry. Earlier this month, Google struck a deal to pay about $2.4 billion for top talent and licensing rights from artificial intelligence coding start-up Windsurf. Yet money isn’t the only consideration for researchers when deciding where to work, Pichai said. Top talent in the field want “to really be at the frontier driving progress,” in addition to craving access to computing power and talented peers, Pichai said. “It’s a combination of all of that and using it to drive impact. And I think we are pretty competitive on all those fronts.” Google’s cloud-computing unit reported quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion and operating income of $2.83 billion, topping analysts’ projections. Google remains in third place in this market, after Microsoft and Amazon, but the company’s prowess in AI has helped it score client wins. The unit is widely viewed as Alphabet’s strongest source of growth as the main search business matures. The centrepiece of the cloud offensive is Gemini, the AI model that Google is rapidly weaving across its vast product portfolio, and pushing to enterprise clients. Many AI experts were impressed by the release of a new version of the Gemini model earlier this year, but it still trails OpenAI’s ChatGPT in adoption by most estimates. As Google faces mounting competition, it’s also facing penalties for being dominant. Google’s primary businesses are under threat of a break-up after US federal judges ruled that the company is maintaining illegal monopolies in search and some ad technology. Next month, Judge Amit Mehta is expected to deliver an order on the measures Google must take to restore competition in online search, though Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. YouTube, Google’s video site, posted $9.8 billion in second-quarter ad revenue, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $9.56 billion. The unit, which draws most of its revenue from advertising, was expected to perform well thanks to its lead in livingroom streaming and heavy investments in podcasts. Alphabet’s Other Bets, a collection of futuristic businesses that includes the self-driving car effort Waymo, generated $373 million in revenue, missing estimates for $429.1 million. Ashkenazi said Alphabet will continue devoting more resources to Waymo. Alphabet has been aggressively expanding the operations of Waymo, which may soon face increased competition as Tesla ramps up its robotaxi business. Earlier this month, Waymo more than doubled its service area in Austin, Tesla’s home base, and said it would start collecting data in New York City in pursuit of a permit for testing. “The team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia,” Pichai said. “We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future.” Google isn’t alone in feeling pressure to show success from AI investment. Shortly after Pichai’s Waymo comments, on the Tesla earnings call, chief executive Elon Musk started slamming Google’s AI prowess. He said Tesla was “actually much better than Google.” Investors might disagree; Tesla’s shares fell. – Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto

Time Published: 2025-07-24T05:00:09Z

The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

Title: As S4 struggles, Sir Martin Sorrell keeps firing shots at the industry he created

Connect with execs from The New York Times, TIME, Dotdash Meredith and many more Sir Martin Sorrell has never lacked for sharp opinions. That’s expected from the architect of the holdco company era. But lately, his commentary has gone from reflective to biting. In recent months, he dismissed WPP’s consolidation efforts as a “disgrace”, lobbed shade at Omnicom for what he implied would be an overpriced acquisition of IPG and blamed WPP’s current struggles on what he called “weak leadership” under CEO Mark Read. In June, he went further: WPP, he said, might be beyond saving. Needless to say, Sir Martin makes his views known. “People, including you, ask for my views,” said Sir Martin in an email to Digiday in response to a request for comment on this story. “I’ve spent almost 50 years at Saatchi & Saatchi, WPP and S4Capital — perhaps, as a continued shareholder in WPP, I have some helpful experience and views.” Helpful or not, those views come with baggage. S4 Capital, the company he built in response to the holdco model he now criticizes, has lost 97% of its market value, issued multiple profit warnings and been caught in the crosswinds of shifting ad budgets. His pointed commentary hasn’t gone unnoticed. “I only wish he was as vocal and clear minded on what needs to be done at S4,” said Anthony Freedman, CEO of marketing services group Common Interest and a shareholder of S4 Capital, on LinkedIn. Sir Martin sees no contradiction. He’s clear-eyed about S4’s challenges — but sees them as macroeconomic not structural. The plan, as he told Digiday, is to stay the course — tighten operations, ride out the volatility and focus on growth in the Americas, Middle East and APAC where clients are still chasing gains. In Europe, he’s betting on a push for greater efficiency and effectiveness. S4 Capital, he insisted, was built for moments like this — when clients demand more for less and faster. The company is focused “on top-line growth with our existing clients and new ones, improved operating margins and liquidity, focussing particularly on improved pricing, billability and reducing duplication,” he wrote. But markets don’t trade on messaging alone. In September 2021, S4 Capital’s shares peaked at $12.25. Today, they hover near 30 cents. Whether there’s an actual bounceback is unclear — but Sir Martin sees one. He points to a current blue-chip client list that includes Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, GM, T-Mobile and Walmart as well as a newly won CPG advertiser he declined to name, as proof that the model still works. As for the broader slowdown in ad dollars from tech clients? That was inevitable, he said. “With 50% of our almost $1B of revenues coming from tech there has been pressure on opex and hence marketing as the “Magnificient 7” and others spend over half a trillion dollars on AI-related capex,” wrote Sir Martin. What’s certain is this: Sir Martin’s critique of the holding company model may still resonate, but the industry feels that it hits differently when coming from someone whose own reinvention is under just as much strain. “What you have to question is, does he provide enough day-to-day leadership?,” said one source who knows Sir Martin well. But it wasn’t always like this. In its early days, S4 Capital had momentum. Launched in 2018 with Sir Martin freshly out of WPP, the company moved quickly — acquiring MediaMonks and MightyHive within months, and landing marquee clients like Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Mondelez and Bayer in its first year. “I always thought the work from them was outstanding, and a big part of that was down to the people who worked there,” said a senior marketer familiar with the group’s pitch, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They weren’t just typical ad agency people, they were from tech and consulting backgrounds.” For a time, this was the story of S4 Capital: proof that a tech-first approach could disrupt the industry. But as the years went on, the cracks began to show. Audit delays in 2022 rocked investor confidence. The following year brought revised revenue guidance — twice — along with 500 layoffs and pressure on margins. The stock cratered. By 2024, S4 Capital was still playing defense, issuing fresh profit warnings and watching its tech-heavy client base pull back on spending. In the background, a CFO change signaled yet another attempt to restore stability. “The person at the top is all about finance models and therefore doesn’t put anywhere near enough emphasis on people and the actual operating of the business,” said an exec familiar with S4’s plans, who exchanged anonymity for candor. As the issues mounted up, so did the tensions at the top. S4 Capital’s equity-heavy acquisition model, which had once helped close deals, began to backfire as the share price fell. Founders who had bought into Sir Martin’s vision started to disengage. “The model of 50% cash and 50% equity works when the share price is growing,” the same exec said. “But as soon as it starts falling, all the owners of the acquired companies become extremely disgruntled, demotivated and less productive.” Despite these issues, few in the industry are ready to count Sir Martin out. His track record, stubbornness and proximity to power still matter. But there’s a growing sense — even amongst those who admire him — that the public markets may no longer be the right arena. “In 12 months’ time, I believe S4 Capital will not exist in its current form,” said an ad exec, with knowledge of the internal issues at the business. Industry chatter suggests that delisting is one option. A merger or acquisition is another. Some believe parts of the business could be spun out through a management buyout. However it unfolds, the status quo isn’t expected to hold. Sir Martin did not comment on any of these potential routes for the company. “I don’t think any public company chairman could or should answer that,” he wrote.” At S4 Capital, I’m focussed on long-term shareowner value maximization and acting in the best interests of all shareowners.” Where S4 will end up is anyone’s guess. It certainly can’t keep headed in the same direction it’s been going. Sir Martin knows what’s wrong with holding companies, but has not yet proven he knows how to build the alternative. The thinking behind the acquisition is to round out Brainlabs’ offering to be more full-funnel, given Exverus’ abilities at the upper end of it. While S&P 500 selection criteria is nuanced, the snub of a peer with a much larger market capitalization warrants questions. There are still numerous sticking points to resolve in CTV if marketers are to feel they’re receiving value for their investment.

Industry chatter suggests that delisting is one option. A merger or acquisition is another. Some believe parts of the business could be spun out through a management buyout. However it unfolds, the status quo isn’t expected to hold. Sir Martin did not comment on any of these potential routes for the company. “I don’t think any public company chairman could or should answer that,” he wrote.” At S4 Capital, I’m focussed on long-term shareowner value maximization and acting in the best interests of all shareowners.” Where S4 will end up is anyone’s guess. It certainly can’t keep headed in the same direction it’s been going. Sir Martin knows what’s wrong with holding companies, but has not yet proven he knows how to build the alternative. The thinking behind the acquisition is to round out Brainlabs’ offering to be more full-funnel, given Exverus’ abilities at the upper end of it. While S&P 500 selection criteria is nuanced, the snub of a peer with a much larger market capitalization warrants questions.

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Title: AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol made 6,666 more than its typical worker | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/business/starbucks-ceo-afl-cio-report

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Starbucks’ coffee isn’t the only thing at the company that’s amped up. Its CEO, Brian Niccol, made a whopping 6,666 times more than the company’s typical employee last year, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual Executive Paywatch report, released Wednesday. It was the widest pay gap by far between the top executive and median worker among the nation’s 500 largest public companies listed in the report. Niccol, who took over the company’s helm last September, received nearly $98 million in compensation, compared to the typical Starbucks worker’s pay of less than $15,000, according to the report, which drew from corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Starbucks is but one example of the hefty pay gap between America’s corporate leaders and their workers, which grew even larger in 2024. CEOs at the largest public companies took home $18.9 million last year, or 285 times as much as the typical US worker’s paycheck of $49,500. That’s up from a ratio of 268 to 1 a year earlier, according to the AFL-CIO, a powerful federation of labor unions representing 15 million workers. The typical employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024, the report noted. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 from the prior year. It topped the prior peak of $18.3 million in 2021, though the ratio was 324 to 1 that year. The typical private sector worker’s raise last year was 3%, the AFL-CIO said, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. At Starbucks, the typical worker is a part-time barista in the US, the company said in its SEC filing. It noted that many of its employees work in part-time, flexible positions, which has the effect of lowering the compensation level of its median employee. Also, the calculation includes its global workforce of about 361,000 staffers, not just the roughly 210,000 US-based workers. Some staffers at the coffee retailer have formed a union, Starbucks Workers United, and have staged strikes at various locations in recent years. Among their demands is a wage increase. It’s “no wonder why the workers there at Starbucks are fighting to form a union with the Starbucks Workers Union to improve their pay and working conditions,” Fred Redmond, AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters. “And these numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality.” Starbucks did not immediately return a request for comment. In its report this year, the AFL-CIO highlighted that the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 will provide CEOs with far bigger tax breaks than workers. The average CEO will receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 from the permanent extension of the lower individual income tax rates, which were initially reduced in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the report found. That compares to a $765 tax break for the typical US worker. Unlike workers, salaries are not the largest component of CEOs’ compensation. Nearly half of the top executives’ total pay was restricted stock awards, and another $4 million were bonuses. The highest-paid CEO of an S&P 500 company was Patrick Smith of Axon Enterprise, which manufactures Tasers and other weapons for law enforcement and the military. He received a package of nearly $165 million. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters. Our GWP stood at INR 3250 crores, reflecting focus on balanced growth and profitability, backed by customer trust and agile execution. The insurance industry is evolving rapidly, shaped by rising awareness, regulatory momentum, and increasing adoption of digital platforms. Our performance is a reflection of our steadfast dedication to customer-focused innovation, operational excellence, and sustainable growth. We remain committed to further strengthening our capabilities and delivering on our promise of protecting what matters most to our customers.” SBI General Insurance, one of India’s leading general insurance companies, today announced its financial results for Q1 FY26, posting a topline growth of 21.5%, significantly higher than the industry (Private & SAHI) growth of 6.2%, marking the Company as one of the fastest-growing general insurers in the country. The Company reported a Gross Written Premium (GWP) of INR 3250 crores, maintaining its upward momentum. Excluding the impact of 1/n accounting norm, the GWP of the Company grew by 25.6% for Q1FY26. The Company gained 78 basis points improvement in private market share, i.e. 6.19% reflecting growing customer preference and an expanding footprint across key markets. The Profit Before Tax (PBT) stood at INR 249 crores, while the loss ratio improved significantly from 86.2% to 81.7%, indicating stronger portfolio quality and disciplined underwriting. Continuing to outpace industry growth, the company reported a Profit After Tax (PAT) of INR 188 crores. The solvency ratio stood at 2.08, well above the regulatory requirement demonstrating strong financial stability. SBI General Insurance continues to lead the Personal Accident (PA) segment, maintaining its position as the No. 1 private insurer. The company gained market share in the key categories of Health by 72 bps , Motor by 47 bps and Personal Accident by 49 bps. The Health and Motor Insurance lines of business remain key growth drivers, while other segments, such as Fire, Engineering, and Liability, have also contributed significantly to the growth. This growth has been propelled by rising awareness, increased demand for comprehensive coverage, growing digital adoption, and supportive government policies.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services posted its best-ever quarterly results in Q1FY26, with a record total profit after tax of ₹1,430 crore. The impressive performance was driven by robust growth in its Asset Management, Private Wealth Management, and Capital Markets segments. Consolidated net operating revenue surged 24% YoY to ₹1,412 crore, while operating PAT rose 21% YoY to ₹522 crore. Reliance Power Limited on Thursday issued a clarification stating that recent media reports concerning enforcement agency actions have no bearing on its operations, financials, or stakeholders. The company emphasized that the reports relate to decade-old allegations involving Reliance Communications and Reliance Home Finance, entities that are independent and separate from Reliance Power. RCOM is under insolvency proceedings for over six years, while RHFL’s resolution was upheld by the Supreme Court. Reliance Power reaffirmed that its governance and operations remain unaffected and continues to focus on business execution and stakeholder value. Supreme Industries Ltd., a plastics products maker, reported a mixed set of earnings for Q1FY26. While sales volume rose 5.73% year-on-year to 1,83,793 metric tonnes, total revenue declined slightly by 1.03% to ₹2,609 crore. EBITDA fell 17.67% YoY to ₹319 crore, reflecting margin pressure. Value-added product turnover, however, remained resilient at ₹933 crore, marginally higher than ₹925 crore in the same quarter last year.

The Indian rupee’s recent fall looks overdone to analysts at Barclays while their counterparts at BofA Global Research reckon that portfolio flows and a weak outlook for the dollar may help the rupee rise over the remainder of the year. Both hedge funds and real money investors added long positions on the rupee last month, per BofA’s proprietary flow indicators. The firm expects the rupee to strengthen to 84 per U.S. dollar by the final quarter of calendar year 2025. Barclays, meanwhile, argues the rupee’s decline over recent months is “reaching limits over the short term,” and recommends fading any weakness around 86.50-87.00 levels. - Reuters Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. has received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its Ibrutinib tablets in 140 mg, 280 mg, and 420 mg strengths. The approved drug is the generic version of Imbruvica®, a kinase inhibitor used to treat adult patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma with 17p deletion, and Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia. The tablets will be manufactured at Zydus’ special economic zone facility in Ahmedabad. According to IQVIA MAT (May 2025), Ibrutinib tablets posted annual sales of approximately USD 2.15 billion in the U.S. market. The tentative nod brings Zydus a step closer to tapping into a high-value oncology segment in the U.S. generics space. Over 35 premises of 50 companies searched in Mumbai and Delhi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act McDonald’s India (West & South), operated by Westlife Foodworld, has launched a first-of-its-kind innovation in the QSR space—its new ‘Protein Plus Range’, featuring a 100% vegetarian, plant-based ‘Protein Slice’ that adds 5g of protein per slice to any burger.

Moreover, borrowing from commercial banks to fund temporary operational cash-flow requirements resulted in higher finance costs in the quarter. However, we have noticed stabilizing prices for edible oil and cocoa, a declining trend in coffee and stabilizing to modest increase in pricing of milk.” Aluminium futures, currently trading at ₹253/kg, broke out of a resistance at ₹251 towards the end of last week.

Defying a weak trend in the broader equity market, leather related stocks such as AKI India Ltd, Zenith Exports, Mirza International and Mayur Uniquoters were trading in the range of 5-1 per cent on the BSE. (PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability. Growth in India’s private sector remained robust in July, supported by strong manufacturing and international demand, but rising inflation and weaker employment generation tempered the expansion, a business survey showed.

Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters.

The company gained market share in the key categories of Health by 72 bps , Motor by 47 bps and Personal Accident by 49 bps.

Barclays, meanwhile, argues the rupee’s decline over recent months is “reaching limits over the short term,” and recommends fading any weakness around 86.50-87.00 levels. - Reuters Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. has received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its Ibrutinib tablets in 140 mg, 280 mg, and 420 mg strengths.

(PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability.

Title: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla so activist investors can’t boot him—but not so much the board can’t fire him if he goes ‘crazy’

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: AWS reportedly shutters AI research lab in Shanghai
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/23/aws-reportedly-shutters-ai-research-lab-shanghai/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T23:12:30Z

UPDATED 19:12 EDT / JULY 23 2025 by Maria Deutscher Amazon Web Services Inc. has reportedly closed an artificial intelligence lab that it operated in Shanghai. The Financial Times reported the move today. The Amazon Web Services AI Shanghai Lablet, as the shuttered facility was known, opened in 2018. It’s unclear how many staffers the center employed. The researchers’ areas of focus included natural language processing and AI development tooling. AWS’ Shanghai AI lab played a key role in creating the Deep Graph Library, an open-source tool for training graph neural networks. Those are AI models optimized to process graphs. A graph is a data structure that can describe how different business records relate to one another, which is valuable for many analytics projects. A former applied scientist at the lab reportedly announced its closure in a post on WeChat, China’s most popular social network. The Financial Post cited the researcher as saying that the lab “was being dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid U.S.-China tensions.” Earlier this month, the U.S. rescinded rules that prevented Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from exporting AI chips to China. However, officials have indicated that they could increase scrutiny of such chip sales going forward. A newly released policy paper from the White House recommends that the U.S. government “pursue creative approaches to export control enforcement.” It’s also possible the closure of the AI lab is related to a recent round of layoffs at AWS. According to Reuters, the Amazon.com Inc. unit has cut “at least hundreds” of roles. It’s believed that AWS’ training and certification team was among the affected business units. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” an Amazon spokesperson told Nikkei Asia today. Other companies are also scaling back their AI work in China. The Financial Times cited sources as saying that McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm, has instructed its business unit in China to avoid taking on generative AI projects. The unit employs more than 1,000 workers. Earlier this year, AWS rival Microsoft Corp. reportedly extended relocation offers to 700-800 of its staffers in China. According to the Wall Street Journal, the employees who received the offers work on AI and cloud projects. The staffers reportedly represent about 10% of the workforce at Microsoft’s Asia Pacific research and development group, which is largely based in China. It’s believed the company earlier shuttered its IoT and AI Insider Lab in Shanghai. Microsoft operates several such facilities around the world. As of 2017, they focused on helping the company’s customers build AI-powered connected devices. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has been weighing a possible acquisition of CNBC, The Post has learned. The 61-year-old e-commerce magnate has signaled interest to business associates in buying the cable network — home to “Squawk Box” and “Mad Money with Jim Cramer” — after it is spun off by NBCUniversal parent Comcast later this year, according to a person familiar with Bezos’ thinking. CNBC would “align well with his interests,” said another source close to Bezos, who noted that the network could serve as a credible “neutral voice” in his media portfolio — a major plus following Bezos’s headaches as owner of the left-leaning Washington Post. The Amazon founder has weathered months of headline-grabbing chaos at the iconic newspaper, which has been mired in losses, layoffs and staff protests over his moves to shift the paper’s coverage in a more centrist, pro-capitalist direction. A rep for Bezos declined to comment. Comcast, meanwhile, plans to spin off its struggling cable assets — which also include MSNBC, USA Network and E! — by the end of the year. CNBC will become part of a publicly-traded company called Versant, which will be run by a handful of NBCUniversal execs led by Chief Executive Mark Lazarus. Sources close to Comcast told The Post that Bezos has not approached the cable giant headed by CEO Brian Roberts. Another source close the situation said Versant plans to grow CNBC, not sell it. Versant declined to comment. It is unclear how much Bezos — currently ranked as the fourth richest person in the world with a net worth of $241 billion, according to Forbes — would be willing to pony up for CNBC. Comcast does not break out financials for its cable assets but recently said the soon-to-be spun-off Versant generated about $7 billion in revenue last year. Buying CNBC would be tricky. There is a two-year period in which Versant could not engage in selling major assets like CNBC or even the entire company without major tax implications, sources told The Post. A source close to the situation said the company won’t likely jeopardize the tax-free nature of the spinoff. Late last year, Comcast announced it would hive off its cable assets and keep NBCUniversal’s NBC broadcast TV network, “Real Housewives” home Bravo, its film and TV studios and theme parks, as well streaming service Peacock. Bezos bought the Washington Post from the family of Katharine Graham in 2013 for $250 million, but the paper since has been dogged by steep losses as subscribers have fled. The Amazon founder has been vacationing with his new bride Lauren Sanchez in the South of France. They were spotted Tuesday leaving glitzy beach club Le Club 55, not far from where the mogul’s mega-yacht, Koru, dropped anchor. Bezos’ desire to expand his media empire follows a flurry of headlines in recent weeks that he was interested in buying Vogue magazine for Sanchez, a former TV reporter — or even the fashion glossy’s parent company Condé Nast. Over the past year, Bezos and Washington Post CEO Will Lewis have tried to move the Beltway broadsheet more to the center — to the dismay of staffers. Bezos’ decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election in November sparked a revolving door of high-profile departures. More than 300,000 readers canceled their subscriptions. The uproar continued after Bezos ordered the outlet’s opinion section to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” — a more neutral topic — rather than weighing in on politics and other issues. The directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of longtime columnist Ruth Marcus. On Monday, Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion writer Jonathan Capehart announced he accepted a buyout. Advertisement

On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we might need an ‘App Store 3.0’ reset. Top Takeaways: 🕹️ The 1980s: Apple’s developer DNA was born Apple’s earliest wins came from nurturing third-party developers, even spinning off its own apps to avoid competing with outsiders. 💸 Microsoft saved Apple (literally) Apple’s near-bankruptcy in the ’90s made them both humble and wary—forever shaping how they deal with developers and competition. 🍎 From “please build for us” to “we choose you” WWDC 2008 saw Apple begging for apps and evangelist emails on slides; today, it’s the other way around. 🖥️ The “Delicious Era” fueled iPhone success Mac indie devs (Panic, Delicious Monster, Bare Bones) built a design-obsessed, passionate community—setting the stage for the iPhone App Store boom. 🚪 App Store 1.0: A new world for indies For the first time, solo developers could launch businesses from home. No server costs, no payments hassle—just build, submit, and sell. 🏦 Apple’s rules got stricter as the App Store grew As the App Store became a services giant, the partnership vibe faded. Developers went from partners to “users” of Apple’s marketplace. 📉 App Store math now feels upside down Today, indie devs can pay Apple millions, while giants like Meta pay almost nothing. The fee logic and incentives don’t fit 2025. ⏳ The platform needs an “App Store 3.0” reset John and David call for a new era: lower fees, clearer rules, and Apple acting as a true platform partner—not just a toll booth. 🔄 Developer enthusiasm is Apple’s long-term moat Apple risks becoming a “legacy only” giant if it loses developer goodwill. The most important apps are still built by outsiders. 👥 A generational handoff is coming With Apple’s senior leadership nearing retirement, now is the time to set new priorities: empower developers, invest in the ecosystem, and ensure Apple’s platforms stay vibrant for decades to come. Resources: Follow us on X: David Barnard: Welcome to the Sub Club Podcast, a show dedicated to the best practices for building and growing app businesses.

My guest today is John Gruber, Raconteur, Apple aficionado, podcast host and sole proprietor of Daring Fireball. On the podcast, I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple's developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the '90s shaped today's control-focused approach and why we might need an App Store 3.0 reset. Hey, John, thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. John Gruber: Well, you've been on my show. I hope to have you on my show again soon, so it's the least I can do. I'm happy to be here. David Barnard: So today, I want to talk Apple Kremlinology, which I think is maybe a great term. I just threw it out there. Apple is such a unique organization that... And for most developers, it's like our most important partner. And I'm doing air quotes for those listening on the podcast. And I don't think a lot of people understand Apple, and I think a lot of how people interact with Apple, what they think of Apple is shaped by just not understanding them, which is maybe on Apple. But that's what I wanted to talk about today was better understanding Apple. And I think of all the people to have this conversation with, it's going to be really fun to have it with you. John Gruber: I appreciate that and only because, and I hate to flatter myself. I really do. I really do. I try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like that's what keeps me in the game. But understanding Apple to me is maybe one of the top three things I have. I really.... David Barnard: Yeah. Yeah, totally. John Gruber: And there's always been an intuitive, oh, I love this company vibe fit and some other rolls of the dice of the way my life could have worked out surely on many of the other rolls of the dice. I end up working at Apple for some amount of time, possibly a very short amount of time, because every time I've ever had a job in my life where I actually am not self-employed has not lasted all that long. So probably not long, but one of my earliest memories, I think it was either fifth or sixth grade, which was early '80s, probably like 1983, '84, I just remember reading a story about Apple Computer and I knew at the time that I liked Apple Computers better than other company's computers, and I loved computers. But I remember reading a story about the company and reading that all of the employees just show up to work in sneakers and jeans and T-shirts and that they wear clever T-shirts and they make. Every time they start a new project, the first job is to print up T-shirts for the team for the new project, and then they wear them to work. And I remember thinking, that's awesome because I don't want to wear a freaking suit and tie to work. And I remember telling my dad this and my dad telling me, "John, there is no way that a major computer company lets the people show up to work in jeans and T-shirts." And I was like, "No, I'm telling you, dad, I read it in a magazine. It's true." David Barnard: That's awesome. And then not to flutter myself, but while we're... We should have scripted this, and I should have done this for you and you should have done this for me, but I relied on ChatGPT pretty heavily to do research for the show because I wanted to go really in-depth in the history of Apple and their relationships with developers. And last night, I'm getting through my notes and ChatGPT says, "Three of the prominent voices in App Store related topics are John Gruber, Ben Thompson and David Barnard." And I don't know if it knew it was me and was freaking trying to flatter me or whatever, but I mean, similar to you in a way that the App Store is something I'm unreasonably passionate about. I have an emotional attachment to the App Store and care so deeply about it. And in part, and you know I've discussed this, I was a recording engineer and I knew that was kind of a dead end as far as having a family and being able to provide and stuff like that. But I was a huge Apple nerd, so I got a 17-inch PowerBook in 2003. So my Apple journey begins a little later. I mean, I used them in college and I played with a original Mac in the '80s, but my real Apple fanboyism started in 2002, 2003. So I jumped right into the App Store in 2008 thinking, "Okay, this is an opportunity to build a real career that's going to provide for my family." And it did. I'm 17 years into owning an app business and I care so deeply about the store and then also care so deeply about Apple. And so everything we're going to talk about today, it's like you being one of the people who cares the most about Apple, who's outside Apple, and me, one of the people who cares the most about the App Store outside of Apple, I think is the two right people to have this kind of conversation. And maybe we should have had Ben on and to have a third voice, but... John Gruber: There are certain things that I just remember which years they were, and I just remember that 2007 iPhone no App Store, 2008 App Store comes out. 2009, it really takes off and coincides really with the go-go years of Twitter. And that's absolutely 100%, there's no confusion. I mean, maybe you sent me an email at daringfireball.net or something, but where I remember getting to know you was on Twitter, and I just remember like it's one of the great privileges of my position doing what I do with Daring Fireball where it's like, "Oh, I'm going to get to know this guy," and we'd at each other on Twitter about App Store issues, but I was like, "This guy," I could sense both your profound enthusiasm for it and the way that it was making you... It wasn't making a fanboy of the App Store where no matter what you wanted to say, "Oh, I love the App Store. So no matter what, I'm going to make my conclusion, whatever changes they make are great." Your enthusiasm was such that you're like, "I want to understand every single thing about this to the deepest degree." And again, it's sort of like a laziness where I'm like, "Oh, if I become friends with this guy," and I've got a Rolodex of people who are experts on whatever, it could be AppKit, could be UIKit, could be the App Store, could be... And you're at the top of the list for the App store and have been since 2009 and probably should have been since 2008. But I just remember, 2009, you were just a key follow on Twitter for App Store related stuff, and it was such a fascinating time, explosive, just an explosive time. David Barnard: Well, and I was a Gruber fanboy, and you linking to my app in the fall of 2008, I think wasn't part of turning point. I mean, they were key people who helped me along the way, including people inside Apple. And I remember vividly... John Gruber: It was the Launcher app, right? What was it called? David Barnard: No, no, no, this was 2008. You linked to my mileage logging app. When the App Store launched, there was this terrible Windows phone ish, horrible user interface, no kind of Mac or iOS interface paradigm, a mileage log. They got there first, which is still eats me to this day. 17 years later, I missed the launch of the App Store because Apple did not approve my developer account. And so a month later, I release a mileage log, it was like we follow the iOS paradigms, I mean, looking back, I don't ever feel like I had the best taste, but I didn't have... It was brown and it was not the prettiest or most, but it was iOS. We used the paradigms of iOS. We built a native app. And so you link to that in the fall of 2008, and it was a turning point. John Gruber: Well, I'm happy, I remember that. And that was the other thing that I remember about you is it wasn't just that you were obsessive about the App Store, is that you actually had skin in the game, and that you clearly... Again, I'm not just trying to butter you up here, but no, but there was at that time, at the very highest level when they first announced the iPhone and said, "Hey," and underneath it was one of the... It wasn't called a Bento box at the time. They did the slides in a different style. But at Steve Jobs original introduction, they had a bunch of things on a slide and they said Cocoa, that everything Apple had done for the original iPhone, before the iPhone, before the App Store, and before they announced, famously took them several months before they said, "Okay, we're going to do an SDK," but they said that they were using Cocoa. There's like a five-minute podcast Merlin Mann did at Macworld Expo talking to me and Jason Snell, the day of the keynote on the floor, it was like a five-minute interview with me and Snell by Merlin Mann. And Snell and I were like, "Apple didn't say much about this Cocoa thing, but presumably at some point, it's just probably not ready yet. They're going to open up APIs and this is going to be huge." I mean, this was hours after the keynote when we were still euphoric about the whole thing because everybody was sort of looking forward to just an iPod phone, right? David Barnard: Right. John Gruber: And it was so much more, it felt like my mind had gotten significantly bigger during the keynote. My brain had grown because the realm of possibility of personal computing was suddenly much larger than I thought. But in that initial moment, most developers were thinking was, "Well, that's fantastic if they're Xocoa APIs," and UIKits slightly different than AppKit, but every single AppKit going back to next developer I know looked at the initial UIKit APIs and was like, "Oh, all right, this is different, but I know this, this is very familiar." But the idea that developers had was how do you take ideas that are good Mac apps and put them on the phone? And for many apps, that was a great idea and Apple itself did that, right? Safari, mail, how do you take mail and make a version that fits on the phone? But the opportunity that I think Mac developers didn't think of right away is what sort of ideas only make sense for a phone, a little pocket, 3.5 inch screen device that's with you all the time. That wouldn't make sense on a Mac and a mileage tracker is exactly that sort of idea. That's what I remember hitting me about that app in 2008. Like, oh, this would be stupid on the Mac. What are you going to do? Take your MacBook or PowerBook? I forget what, I guess they were MacBook set by 2008, but what are you going to do? Take a laptop with you in your car everywhere and log your gas and mileage? No, but for something that would replace what you would've done in a pocket notebook, that's a perfect idea. Obviously, people want this. And that's where I feel like you were ahead of me and I'm like, "I got to follow this guy because he's thinking about things that are phone first." David Barnard: Right. Yeah. Well, enough navel-gazing. I'm blushing. But I appreciate all of that. And again, just the perfect person to have this kind of conversation with, which I've wanted to have this conversation for a while in service of the community of... In my day job at RevenueCat, and I do still build apps on the side, so I'm still an indie developer, I was looking at my LinkedIn the other day and 17 years at Contrast and still going strong, still running my weather app on the side and stuff. So at my day job at RevenueCat, I interface with a ton of developers and a lot of them don't care one lick about Apple, in fact, I mean, the growing hostility, people who've never built an app before will book an office hours call with me and say, "Screw Apple, screw them in their 30%." There's no care for Apple as a company or the products or anything like that. And so I wanted to do this podcast to give some of that history. I was actually thinking as I was preparing these notes, it's almost a book at some point, the history of the App Store and how it shaped the world. I mean, so many decisions that Apple made, big and small, literally did shape how things happen, and we'll get into some of that. But I wanted to step all the way back, and again, in doing the research for this over the weekend, I saw something that really surprised me, and I think I knew this, but I hadn't seen the numbers. And that is that the three top executives at Apple whose teams work on the app store. So I think maybe, and Apple is famously secretive about who does what and who reports to who and those kinds of things. But from my understanding... John Gruber: They're secretive about everything, David. David Barnard: Everything, yeah. Yeah. Something like 90% of the people who interface with developers in the App Store who work on the App Store report up to three executives. Greg Joswiak, who joined Apple in 1986. John Gruber: Yeah, I think right out of college. He went to University of Michigan and went right to Apple. David Barnard: Phil Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987, and Eddy Cue who joined Apple in 1989. And so to really understand Apple and how they interact with developers and how they receive the developer community, you really do have to go all the way back to the 1980s when these three key executives joined and started, and each of them have their different role in developer relations over time. But going back to that 1984 release of the Mac and these early days of developer relations between Apple and developers, I think is so fascinating, and one of the things, again, I didn't eve... I knew, but seeing it again in black and white, just how instrumental Microsoft was in those early days to Apple that two years ahead of the 1984 release of the Mac, Microsoft had agreed to build products for this new platform. And then specifically, and again, never heard this before, but Bill Gates was kind of an Apple fanboy in some of the early days before they got really contentious. And I read this history piece about the history of Apple that said Gates would show up to events, Macworld and other events with Macintosh shirts, he would wear a Macintosh. I mean, can you even imagine Bill Gates in the '80s wearing Macintosh T-shirt? It was just such a different era. But then over time, developer relations started to get a bit contentious. What do you remember? I mean, you were, gosh, like 6, 8, 10 at the time when all this happened. And I was five. But we both read a lot about the history. So what do you recall? And then what do you remember from having read upon all this. John Gruber: Too young to have experienced those years extemporaneously, but from what I've read, one of the key superpowers that Gates had, and I think it's true, I think this is not an original observation, but no matter how big, and no matter even... I mean, I guess eventually after, when you get closer to 50 years, which Apple and Microsoft are at, but maybe closer to a century after entire original generations have clearly all died off, it fades away. But all companies in all fields are just infused with the personalities of their founders. And one of the things that Gates infused in Microsoft was an amazing willingness or just natural ability. I don't even think it was something he did purposefully. I think it's just the way his mind worked is he was always thinking what could be and was not attached to the way things were. The whole name Microsoft, the whole idea that revolution of the company was, "Hey, we could make a company." This was him and Paul Allen that just focuses on software and had no plans in those early days to make their own computer. And all of the action in the late '70s at that moment of the PC revolution, the late '70s and the early '80s was on the company's making computers, Apple and Commodore and Texas Instruments, you name it, IBM, once they made the PC and Microsoft's key insight was, "Hey, software is incredibly valuable." And at the time, that idea alone was revolutionary. It was absolutely revolutionary because everybody else thought the only thing that matters is computers and computers were all absurdly expensive. Just look at the memory that was in those computers. The Commodore 64 was called the 64, not because it was 64 bit, but because it had 64 kilobytes of RAM, right? That was the 64, and it wasn't cheap, cheap. And the idea was software, you just copy, it was just ones and zeros. You could just make copies. And the idea that no, no software is worth paying for was a revolution. And I think that's why Gates could have such incredible enthusiasm for something like some other company's computer because everything they did was for somebody else's computer. They didn't make computers and they didn't really have a platform. And so I think Gates recognized early that Apple made better computers and that they were onto something. And he clearly, from the outset, had the mindset of the complete opposite of, I forget his name, but the 1960s era, IBM CEO who said, "I think there's a market in the world for six or seven computers." Because the thinking in that era was, well, the US military will want one, maybe like the US IRS, and there'll be one great supercomputer for universities to share. Whereas Gates was really thinking early on, "Oh no, there should be computers in every house." But he wasn't thinking that Microsoft would own a platform. But then when the opportunity came with DOS and they saw the opportunity they had by owning MS-DOS and being the company that provided it, it changed their thinking completely to instead of, oh, we'll make software for anybody's computer. We're going to make a platform and we'll still make some software for other platforms, but we really want to steer everybody to our platform even though we don't make the computers. David Barnard: One of the interesting footnotes in this as well is that Apple had a similar idea of we're building this platform, we need to make sure there's software on it. And so they built Mac, right? MacPaint, MacDraw, and a bunch of other apps. And again, something I didn't realize until doing all this research was that in 1986, they stopped bundling those because it was competitive with third-party developers. And man, I mean, these days with sherlocking and Apple building an app for everything, I mean, even most recently building an invite app like building a sports app, Apple has over the last 17 years of the App Store gone deeper and deeper and further and further into competing directly with third-party developers. But back here in the '80s, they were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't want to squash the potential for third-party developers to build for this platform that we have. So these apps that we built for our own platform that we have previously bundled," I mean, again, at some point maybe when Schiller or Jos or one of these guys retires, we'll do this again and get the inside scoop on some of the deeper thinking behind this. But they stopped bundling, and then in 1987, they spun all those apps off into Claris, a subsidiary of Apple to have them at little bit more of an arm's length. It's specifically to not interfere with third-party developers. And it's still fascinating to go all the way back to the '80s and see such a different Apple that they recognized the power of developers in the platform and were actively doing things at that time to make sure they didn't compete. They didn't make it a non-starter for people to build these kind of apps for the Macintosh platform, which is just fascinating. John Gruber: And it was about a decade, I would say maybe '86, '87, and those are the years where I was there as a teenager into college, and '86 to '95, '96 or so was the decade where Apple was very hands-off about first-party apps and it made sense. And one of the areas of contention, it's sort of like a heartbreak, and I forget the exact details. I know Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful, wonderful... I think there's a story about it on Folklore.org, but you can look it up. But there were two basics, the basic programming language for the Mac in the very early '80s and Apple Basic was much better and could let you do Macintosh-like things like pop open a dialog box, which you think like, well, of course, why would you want to have a programming environment for the Mac that couldn't pop open a dialog box? But that was revolutionary at the time, and Microsoft had their basic, and as like a, let's keep Microsoft happy, Apple sort of squashed their own in-house basic, which was a much better programming environment for the Macintosh. So as not to step on the toes of Microsoft Basic, which was more of a oh, character based sort of text interface basic, where you could write the same Microsoft Basic program and run it on the Mac and run it on any other computer that had Microsoft Basic. And that's just one example of that sort of thinking and this sort of thing that led them to spin off the initial, which they had to do again because nobody knew how to write these graphical user interface programs. It often comes up and people, you have to Google the images to believe it, but the original Macintosh keyboard didn't have arrow keys because they wanted to force developers and users to use the mouse as opposed to almost all other computers at the time didn't even have mice. So there was the Macintosh, which had a mouse and other computers which had no pointer interface, just a keyboard interface. So you'd be like, "What do you want to do in the computer?" And it would present a text menu and you'd use arrow keys to go up and down. I want to open existing file down. I want to create a new file down. I want to manage my files up, down, left, right. So to force developers to make programs that were mouse driven, mouse pointer driven. Apple didn't even put arrow keys on the original Macintosh keyboard, which imagine the frustration editing text now. So if you wanted to, you could backspace, there was a delete key, but if you wanted to go back a word or two, you had to go take your hands off the keyboard, go to the mouse and click where you wanted to go. But I understand why that didn't last, but I also understand the thinking at the time to break people's habits because as much as they thought this is a computer for the rest of us, which was their slogan, and this will be the way that most people in the future learn to use computers. Right now, the market is people who already know how to use computers, but what they know from the existing computers isn't the way this computer works. And so they had to make apps like MacWrite and MacPaint and MacDraw, and then two years in, they're like, "Ah, we're kind of squashing the market. What we really need is a thriving third party market, so let's go hands off." And then for the next decade, the Mac really didn't have many first party programs. If you just went to the store and bought a brand new Macintosh in 1991 or '92, you got TextEdit or it was called SimpleText at the time. There were very few apps that were built in. There was no built-in Contacts app. You didn't have all these things that you would think, "Oh, how do you have a computer without an address book?" Well, the idea was that whole thing was a third party opportunity. David Barnard: And this is a great example of why I wanted to have this conversation, and maybe we'll pull on some of these threads as we go through. One thing to understand about Apple and how they operate today is that they've had success in doing those sorts of things. And so when you look at Apple TV that famously launched, and Apple tried to get people to develop games for it, but you could only use the Apple remote, and it was Apple as with the keyboard not having arrow keys, it was, we don't want people to require a gaming controller to build games, so we're going to force them to use remote. And games sucked, and I was so pissed at Apple, it took them, what, three or four years to finally enable controller support. And by that time, it was just so clear that Apple TV was not going to be a gaming platform, maybe could have been more of a gaming platform had they done it, maybe it was the right choice, whatever. And then look at the Vision Pro. Two years ago, I was so frustrated that Apple didn't release motion track controllers like what you have on the Meta Quest, but why did they do that? It goes all the way back to 1984 and not having the arrow keys, it was, "Hey, we're introducing a new user interface paradigm, a new user experience, and we want to force developers to build apps that use hand gestures and eye tracking and not controllers." Now, two years later, they just announced at WABC that PlayStation VR controller support in Vision Pro, but this is two years after the fact, and I was so frustrated two years ago. But this is one of those things when you look back, you better understand why they make the decisions they make. They have a long history of making those kinds of decisions going all the way back to the '80s and forcing developers into the path that they think is best for the platform is just so fascinating. John Gruber: I keep repeating it. I'm more bullish on visionOS as a platform than most commentators, and I keep drawing the analogy to the original Macintosh, the original Macintosh in 1984, I know the number off the top of my head because I bring it up all the time. It was $2,500, which inflation adjusted is give or take right now, like $7,200. There was only one config. There was no option to get more RAM. There was no storage, you used floppy drives. So $2,500, it was 7,200 equivalent today about twice the cost of a Vision Pro, very expensive. It's sold so poorly and so under their expectations that it was the impetus for driving jobs out of the company. And in the whole, people don't know the history, like how in the world did Apple kick Steve Jobs out of the company? The real reasons were mostly personality conflicts, and that yes, of course, he did not work well when there was somebody else, John Sculley from Pepsi as the CEO who Jobs, the founder, ostensibly reported to, of course, Jobs did not work well as anything but the CEO, and that's ultimately the reason. But in terms of going to the board and having reasons other than this guy's a pain in my ass, to force him out, the sales of the Mac were the... And again, it was expensive and Apple couldn't really afford the fact that it was a bit of a flop in 1984, 1985, but the PC press of the time took it as, "Hey, this whole graphical user interface thing, it's clever, but it's a gimmick. This isn't how real computer users want to use a computer. Nobody wants to take their hands off the keyboard and use a mouse all the time. It's a waste of memory to be drawing all these windows and stuff like this." That was all proven wrong. The Mac was the right idea for the future of personal computing, but it needed at least four or five years before you're like, "Holy, shit, this is like a thriving platform that's revolutionizing certain industries like desktop publishing." David Barnard: Yeah. And as a 40, almost 50-year-old company, I guess next year it's 50 years, somewhere around there. Apple's patience is remarkable. This is another thing that I continually get wrong, and I think a lot of people get wrong. 100% agree on the Vision Pro. It is a phenomenal piece of hardware. It is an incredible platform for experimenting with the future, even if it's flawed and even if there are problems. But Apple's patient, and clearly they have AR stuff in the labs that Cook and others have played with. There's been reporting recently about all Tim Cook thinks about is getting to this AR glasses future or whatever it might be. And the Vision Pro is that first step along the way, and Apple is very patient, as much as people pan it as few units as they sold, even if it's been less successful as they internally hope for, they are nothing if not a patient company that's going to keep plugging away at these things. Because look how it turned out for the Mac, like you said, it took four or five years. Well, I mean, we're two years into the Vision Pro. They've got time and they've got cash to wait around and they've got the experience of building these platforms over decades, not making sure something is a hit in months and days. John Gruber: This is only based on observation, but I think I almost see how can somebody refute this is that their thinking is basically if their projection of where a hit AR/VR, let's just put aside whether the first hit product in the category will be AR or VR, but it'll probably be AR, right? VR is just too weird where my definition of the difference, the broad difference here is if the device is off, powered off, can you see anything or do you see through glasses, right? If it's glasses that when the device is at 0% battery powered off, you still see through the lenses, that's AR. And if it's like Vision Pro where it's off, it's like blindfolds, that's VR, it's probably AR, but let's just say it doesn't matter. Put that aside, that it'll take till around 2030 to have a product at a price and a feature set and a battery life that's compelling to explode in popularity and that people will be like, "I got to get one of those." If it's 2030, when that's going to come out, what's the right way to approach the market? And I think the people who are laughing at Vision Pro and saying, "It's $3,500, nobody's bought one. They've only sold hundreds of thousands, not even a million, whatever." Apple should have waited until then to release a product, and then boom, here's the first thing. And the iPhone was sort of like that, right? And the iPhone was right out of the gate. Yes, it was a little more expensive, but the first iPhone was incredibly useful, totally credible device. And I know it didn't sell in great quantities compared to today's numbers, but as somebody who bought one, it was like, "Yeah, this is real." And it's not like I'm buying a product that hints at a future. The Vision Pro is not like that. The Vision Pro is not the iPhone in 2007. The Vision Pro today, I don't like calling it a dev kit, but it's like an enthusiast kit, which includes developers, but it's an enthusiast kit that you spend a ridiculous amount of money compared to a MacBook Air. You get a really good MacBook Air for $1,000, or you could get a really good MacBook Air for 1,300, $1,400. This is three times, four times more expensive and it's less essential to people's lives than their iPhone, which you can get a really good iPhone for seven, $800. It's different than that, but is the right strategy to wait until that hardware is out in 2030 and then start there with building a platform or is the right strategy to start building a platform around 2023, 2024, and when that hardware is finally available and there's a breakthrough in the technology and the price and the capabilities in the battery life that you've got five years of ecosystem and content behind it. All these complaints, again, I've complained too and I'm a little surprised, but they're getting there, just in terms of having entertaining immersive content, the things like the Bono video and the adventure climbing mountains and all this stuff. They've got some stuff, you would think with their budget that they could have more, but the idea of, hey, if they're going to sell this thing for all this money, shouldn't they have more content available? Well, if 2030 is when they think this is going to explode, think of how much content they're going to have in the library by then. And I think that's what they know. There are so many similarities between this and the Macintosh in 1984, but there are also so many profound differences because Apple is so big and so pervasive in popular culture and people's lives. And it breeds a different sentiment towards the company, which I think we're going to continue talking about with developer relations. But then on the other hand, their profound, almost unfathomable financial success gives them the liberty of saying, "We're going to make a seven-year bet that costs a lot of money," just in terms of this thousand or so software engineers who work on Vision stuff inside the company. We're going to make a profound bet to build this out over half a decade so that when the hardware's really there for a mass-market thing, we've got it. We've already got the platform, we've already got the UI paradigms nailed down, we've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be... John Gruber: ... nailed down. We've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be there five years ahead of time. It's a very different way of thinking than a company that is sweating it out. Are we still going to be in business two quarters from now? David Barnard: Yeah, and I think that's part of the pushback is that too many people, especially in the press, continue to expect every product Apple releases to be the next iPhone. And the iPhone is just singular in history as a consumer electronic device that it was able to come out of the gate as such an incredible useful day one thing. Because even, and again, I mean, this is why we're having this conversation. You go back to 1984, the $2,500, which is $7,200 a day or whatever it is, was not a daily driver, this is changing my life, most productive thing in the world. It was a nice to have, it was an enthusiast, it was something to tinker with and maybe you find a few productivity things here and there that it benefits. Apple has done this decade after decade after decade, and they have that long vision. And again, going back to these execs who've been around through it all, it's like they've seen it happen and they know it will happen and they know it can happen. And to your point, they're not under that pressure of the Vision Pro has to be the iPhone. It doesn't have to be the iPhone. We've done this 10 times before with different products with transitioning from Power PC to Intel, with early days of iMac and it becoming a consumer hit that wasn't even the massive smash hit compared to the iPhone. And so it's like they know how to build platforms over decades and not over months and years that everybody else expects it to happen. John Gruber: So the one difference, and it is almost the same thing but along a different vector where I said about Gates and the way that Gates instilled in Microsoft a sort of flexibility in thinking like, hey, what's the opportunities right now? I think Satya Nadella's era as CEO embodies that where I feel like he came in and was like, you know what? We don't have to be all about Windows, Windows, Windows. We can go to more of a cloud first mindset and look at where they are financially and in cloud services and stuff. It's been a great deal for them, but that they got their institutional fortitude is once we have a hit, we will latch onto it and try to stick with it and ride it all the way down. And that was the whole mindset with Windows. Windows everywhere and they're going to put Windows on your TV set-top box and Windows phone, right? And they were trying to make smartphones years before the iPhone and literally they had a start menu in the lower left corner. It looked like Windows 95 but on a phone and it wasn't running Windows apps, but it was a mindset of bringing Windows mentality. Whereas Apple's mindset led by Steve Jobs was let's start from scratch. And as much as they wound up using the Cocoa APIs and made UI kit, it was only not because that was a starting point. It was like, okay, if we're going to do this, maybe we could fit a small version of the Mac kernel onto this device and we'll build it, but we're not going to have any compatibility. It's not going to be called the Mac phone. We're not going to have an Apple menu up in the upper left corner. We're going to rethink this whole thing from scratch. Apple has this sort of, if it's a new form factor, we're going to start with a new platform and that's a very different thinking, but at another level, just in terms of its capabilities, the reason the iPhone could debut in 2007 as a totally credible, you could buy one right now, the first one totally useful is that it's ultimately, and this is the unifying theme of the last five years of dithering with me and Ben Thompson, is that the biggest marketing shame of the entire industry is that we wasted the term personal computer on desktop and laptop computers in 1980 because the phone is ultimately the personal computer. And that's where everything was heading from the Apple One in 1977 until 2007. Everything was heading towards building something under $1,000 that fit in your pocket and had an interface that anybody could just use and that the input was just poking at it with your finger and it was all visual and it had wireless connection to a network that connected to the entire world. It was so science fiction from the perspective of 1978, 79, but within 30 years, that's where everything in those 30 years was heading. So when it launched, it was really the culmination of what we've called personal computers for 30 years, whereas Vision Pro is sort of like, let's do something all new and we have to sort of start from scratch. It's going to be way too expensive and heavy and limited and the battery's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's a totally new vector. David Barnard: Yeah, well, we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves. I want to go all the way back to the eighties again. It's important to step through the history of these developer relations of what brought us even to the iPhone. So I'll speed through this. You and I could talk for five hours, but I don't think we should turn this into a five-hour podcast, so I'll speed through a little bit of this. But going all the way back to the eighties, PageMaker was a huge turning point. Third party app, some people have credited it as saving the Mac platform. That it was so important to digital publishing and this is where as a platform apps can revolutionize your platform. When you've built a and hardware and third party developers go nuts on it, they build new things and do things that you would've never done as a first party software closed ecosystem, it's only Apple and the Mac and we're the only ones building for it. You get this entire ecosystem of people building new things and PageMaker was one of those things that became so integral to the digital publishing world that it's credited as a third party app for saving the whole Apple Mac platform and then you get Illustrator for Mac in 87, you get Photoshop in 1990 and during this time I think Apple really recognizes that power of developers. Guy Kawasaki joined around that time. I forget exactly, I think he may have joined before the 1984 Mac, but he was the first software evangelist and developer evangelist. Again, in doing research for this and reading up on some of the history of this, I realized just how much a debt of gratitude in some ways I owe to Guy Kawasaki for me having a job today at Revenue is that he... This whole developer advocacy and people who aren't technical or... I mean, I'm mildly technical but really can promote these platforms. It goes all the way back to the eighties and Guy Kawasaki and Apple being so enthusiastic for third party developers. John Gruber: I know Guy a little, I feel like I should know him better. I feel like he sort of left this racket right around the time that I was becoming more prominent in this industry, but I've met him a few times, but I've read his books and the Macintosh Way, it's a great book if you can find a copy of it. When I joined Barebone Software, I worked at Bare Bones, the BB edit company from 2000 to 2002. It was the only mandatory reading before. It was like the entire employee onboarding process was you have to read Guy Kawasaki's the Macintosh Way, but arguably it was the Apple way and at the time though, because it was the only successful platform Apple had, the Macintosh and Apple were easily conflated, but I think that what Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the intersection of developers, users, and the platform maker and that combined the three could form a cohesive whole that everything... And formed a flywheel where it just kept benefiting everybody where users are happy and they're buying the devices, which helps the platform maker and that the more devices the platform maker makes, the bigger the market is for third party developers. And so third party developers make more and invest more in the platform and make more innovative software that makes users like, oh my God, look what PageMaker can do. Holy crap. And then the users buy more of the... And it just keeps going and going. David Barnard: Sounds a lot like the iPhone. John Gruber: Yeah, I think that the other thing that Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the idea that you could be an important serious player professionally in this field without being a programmer or a designer even. You could be a professional user. I'm a writer and I have a computer science degree from college from long ago, so more technical than most users, but I get that mindset where kind of what I wanted to be was a professional user, by being an enthusiast and learning how everything works. And that was his evangelism. It wasn't evangelism in the sense of evangelizing a religion based on faith. It was more like a religion based on practical advantages, like hey, learn how to do these things, learn how the actual system works and you're going to have superpowers compared to people who do the same thing as you who don't understand how these computers work. One person can do the work of 10 people with a Macintosh, and it was true. David Barnard: I saw that guy has been doing the rounds on podcasts. You should definitely have them on your podcast at some point. That'd be one I would love to listen to, you and Guy talking through this for two hours. We're kind of breezing over it in five minutes here, but I think it would be a fascinating listen for you and Guy to kind of talk through that in more detail. But we did want to keep moving. So that was the kind of eighties and into the early nineties. But then what happened in the nineties I think is kind of pivotal to Apple's relationship with developers is that in the nineties, and you know this better than I, so you can fill in the details here, but hardware sales started to tank. Things started to get really rocky for Apple and they got to this point where third-party developers had so much power over Apple that if Adobe wasn't updating their apps on the Mac platform and simultaneously the Windows platform had taken off at that point where they were probably, I assume making way more money on the Windows platform. It was kind of the platform to be on during that time, but Apple desperately needed those third-party developers to continue building for the platform to keep the platform sustainable. And that all kind of culminated in 1997 with the famous Steve Jobs standing in an auditorium with a giant screen of Bill Gates behind him and Microsoft saving Apple. And again, people who haven't studied the history or been around or not old men like you and I couldn't even fathom that Microsoft saved Apple. Had Microsoft not done that, Apple would've gone bankrupt. So fill in some of the gaps there. What happened in the nineties and how did Apple get into this desperate point where third-party developers had so much power over them needing Microsoft to save the company. John Gruber: I think point one that gets overlooked a lot in the years where Jobs was exiled from Apple, who knows what would've happened. Maybe that was for the best that he went and founded... It worked out well for him to go found Next, struggle to make next a thing and then have Next in Apple. I always call it a reunification rather than an acquisition because it really is so obvious. I mean, Craig Federighi's first job out of college was at Next and it's like he left for a while, right? Scott Forstall, but where Apple got lost in those years, one of the ways, and I think I haven't seen a lot of people or a lot of books focus on it, was the sort of mindset in the early PC years, a company would come out with a new computer and the computer was the platform effectively, and there wasn't really this idea, there wasn't so much of you'd make the Commodore 64 and then when Commodore came out with the Commodore 128, I forget if you could run Commodore 64 programs, but it was sort of a new computer. It was like, ah, this is a different computer. And then Commodore came out with Amiga is sort of an overlooked thing in history and I know the panic guys were big Amiga fans and the Amiga had the video toaster was doing digital video editing way before any other computer platform. It had some amazing capabilities, but Commodore just exemplifies it. Commodore 64 was a hit, then the 128 not so much of a hit, then the Amiga, which was way more capable. But that every couple of years the idea was there'd be like a new thing and backwards compatibility was like a maybe and it would be like a mode, but basically you'd sort of come out with an all new thing every couple years as opposed to evolving a platform over decades. It just didn't enter Apple's mind. And so Apple had all of these failed next generation, what's going to come after the Macintosh things in the late eighties and especially the early nineties, Pink and Taligent, and it's all confusing and it would take forever to explain as opposed to what was an operating system and what was a company and what was a cross-platform like? Taligent was sort of a cross company thing with IBM where it was in addition to an operating system, they'd make a new platform and the power PC chip architecture sort of came out of that. And so it wasn't totally futile, but the idea wasn't to how do we keep evolving the Macintosh? It was what comes after the Macintosh. That's the fundamental flaw. And the Newton is laughed at in some ways and other ways people are like, oh man, they're sort of a decade ahead of in terms of you'd have a handheld thing in your hand with a touchscreen, but the most obvious problem with the Newton was that something handheld that needs ubiquitous wireless networking. And there wasn't even Wi-Fi at the time, let alone cellular. Palm Pilot was sort of more of a hit, but mostly because it was affordable. And people like me, I had one, I had a handspring visor and I liked it. In hindsight, there's a lot of younger people who probably vaguely have heard of Palm Pilots, but it wasn't that big a deal. At the time, people are like, oh, the Palm Pilot is what Apple should have made with the Newton. No, because even the Palm Pilot really wasn't that big of a hit and it didn't have any staying power because it didn't do networking, it didn't have a connection to the internet, even Wi-Fi, let alone cellular. That's really what a handheld needed. But the other thing about the Newton that was just as important to its failure was it really hardly related to the Macintosh at all. There was a Newton, I forget what it's called, Newton Sink Utility or something, and you connect a serial cable to your Mac and Newton, you could sync some things, but like I said earlier, there was no contact app on the Mac from Apple. So where did your Newton contacts go? The Newton had a contacts app because it was a personal digital assistant and they had all of these things about what comes after the Macintosh when what they should have clearly been thinking of is how do we move the Macintosh forward? And meanwhile, while Apple's core interest and at the top level of the company was interested on these big expensive, all-failed next generation, what comes after the Macintosh? There were people at Apple who were grinding away on the Macintosh, putting out system seven and then system 7.1, system 7.5 and sort of keeping the company alive financially because that's an actual platform that people were using and buying. And I think at the highest level, Apple was looking at that the way that the Macintosh part of the company was looking at the Apple II in the eighties. And for most of those mid to late eighties, Apple was staying alive financially through Apple II sales, not Macintosh sales. And they were thinking, that's what the Macintosh is doing now and we will get pink or Copeland or whatever this thing is. Copeland was a next generation Mac. That was where they started to get it through their head that, oh, what we really need to do is keep the Mac alive and come up with something. They just wasted half a decade of great still explosive new stuff coming out. The whole internet thing happened in the midst of that where there was no internet to speak of. I mean, the internet existed, but it was like a university type thing in 1991 and by 1993, 4, 5, it was like, oh, Netscape is a huge thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft was doing the opposite with Windows where they're like Windows One, nobody used, nobody even heard of Windows Two, nobody used, nobody heard of. Windows Three, now people are using it instead of DOS, but it was really clunky and awful and they're like, let's make a better one. Let's make one that steals interface ideas from Next where the buttons and stuff look 3D and have gray scale. And they were grinding away on making the thing that was sort of a hit just a little better every couple years. And Apple just lost half a decade in that period. And thankfully they had people who were incrementally making the Macintosh better, but then they'd sort of painted themselves in a corner where the Macintosh operating system, not to get too super nerdy, but was still fundamentally based on some assumptions from the mid-eighties about how low level all software worked and the idea of preemptive multitasking where a program crashing couldn't possibly crash the whole computer because it would just be the program. Whereas the Macintosh was so low level and all programs sort of made some low level assumptions where they were, there was no kernel to speak of in computer science terms in that classic macOS. And they were doing things with low level memory where like, hey, if Internet Explorer froze up, your whole computer might just freeze. And then you had to literally use the power button on the hardware to restart it and anything you had open that wasn't saved was gone. In 1984, 85, 86, that's the way a computer like the Macintosh had to work. There was no option to do preemptive multitasking and have memory safe applications in that era because of the constraints of the hardware. But by 1995, 96, that was totally possible and it was obviously the way it should be, but there was no simple way to just say that's how the next version of macOS is going to work. And all of the existing apps like Photoshop and Excel and Microsoft Word will just work. There was no way. It was too incompatible. And that's what you were talking about earlier where Apple was up against it because the only reason the Macintosh was thriving was because of these apps from companies... And the big ones were Adobe and Microsoft, and if their existing apps didn't continue to work, there was no way anybody was going to upgrade to whatever they came up with no matter what its technical capabilities. David Barnard: And so then being back against the wall and Jobs having gone off to Next and built that next iteration, the Next revolution in computing the foundation for everything we do today was what Jobs built at Next, they acquired Next in 96 and Jobs comes back and then that's what leads up to this Microsoft committing to the platform, investing money into Apple. And then I wanted to read a quote, and this is going to be long, and those of you who really care can go back and watch. There's a video of this is that at WWDC in 1997. There's a quote from Jobs. A developer asked about OpenDoc, so I [inaudible 00:55:54] all this, but we can skip over the details of it because I think the details are less important, but Apple decided to kill this technology, OpenDoc and the developer very frustrated, goes up to the mic at WWDC during an open mic session with Steve Jobs at WWDC in 97. Very frustrated, why are you killing this thing? We've invested a lot of money into it and I want to read the quote. I kind of jump around in the quote because it would take 10 minutes to read, but let me read this quote from Steve Jobs because I think it's just so fascinating. "I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of, I apologize, I feel your pain." I wanted to get that in there because can you imagine Apple in 2025 saying, I apologize, I feel your pain and just the rest of this is so good. John Gruber: I can imagine it, but it would be very surprising and I feel like that's exactly what they could use, but yes. David Barnard: Yeah, that's what we're going to get to and that's why I wanted these quotes. We'll come back to it maybe an hour from now when we get deeper into the iPhone stuff. So continuing, it's skipping around the quote, but "focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no and you've got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you off people. So you take your lumps and Apple has been taking their share of lumps for the past six months in a very unfair way, and it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that." Man, Steve Jobs off the cuff. I miss that. I miss that so much. "And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." So again, that's missing a lot of context. It's missing a lot of the actual quote. You can go back and watch the video. I'll put it in the show notes, but I just thought that was so fascinating that Apple in '97 was at this point that Steve Jobs of all people was there on stage answering this kind of question with a level of kind of humility and self-awareness that, "Hey, developers are so important. I feel your pain. I'm sorry, I apologize. But then also clearly talking to the future of like, hey, this is going to be hard, but we're building towards something." And they included that quote specifically from what you were alluding to is that in this forty-year history with developers, there have been moments like that where you see a more open Apple, a more contrite Apple, and that the success of the iPhone has really changed the way I feel like Apple does relate to developers and Apple has not had to take its lumps in a good 20 or 30 years and has not had that level of forthrightness and humility with developers when things do go sideways, and this is where I think Ben Thompson has said multiple times on different podcasts and articles he's written, I think some people inside Apple view this and maybe those three top execs who've been there this whole time and a lot of people inside Apple, it felt humiliating, not humble. And that this was a period in their history that they were so beholden to third-party developers and they never wanted to be in that position again. They never wanted to have to take lumps again. They never wanted to be on that verge of bankruptcy. They never wanted to feel that pain and be humiliated like that again versus I go back and I read this, I'm like, wow, what a great example of just how much goodwill do you instill in developers in the entire ecosystem by speaking like that to developers? John Gruber: The first thing I'll say to that is that of those three executives you've mentioned, Eddie Kew, Jaws, and Schiller. Schiller's the exception where Schiller, I know you probably know this, actually hasn't been in Apple continuously since 1987 or whatever, and in the early nineties he was, I forget where else, but he ended up at Macromedia, which was the company behind PageMaker, or maybe not... No, I forget, but they had... They were the competitor to Adobe, and so Schiller has been on the other side of that divide making the essential tools for the Mac. That just helps add to that same perspective though of knowing how much leverage those companies had over Apple. And the two things that were scarring to Apple were the near bankruptcy. And so it's made the company institutionally incredibly frugal and more so while Jaws was still alive, it was only after Jaws died and Cook took over that they started doing things like shareholder buybacks and stuff while Jaws was alive. They were just hoarding their profits. They just were putting it into that Braeburn Capital subsidiary and just sitting on an ever-growing mountain of cash because in the same way that my grandparents who had been through the Great Depression would eat, scrape every single bit of food off their plate and thought it was offensive, no matter whether you thought it tasted good or whether you were still hungry, it was offensive not to eat every bit of food offered to you because they remembered not having enough food and the parts of the company that remembered being on the verge of bankruptcy, in some ways it helps focus the company, but in some ways in the long run sort of hurt them. And I think having somebody new like Tim Cook, again, he's been there a long time, but he wasn't there for the near bankruptcy part or came in just after, and so he wasn't as scarred by it. But I think that developer relations part definitely has, now that Apple has gotten big, has hurt them. That they're still so thinking of themselves as underdogs who want to assert not dominance over developers from their perspective, but having at least 51% of the power over developers that they've lost the fact that they've actually got 95% of the power or however you want to assign the power dynamic in the current state. They're so hell-bent on making sure they never fall below 51% of the power between the platform and the developers that they've just lost sight of how overwhelmingly they've already won and how much it would be in their interest to make concessions because of the surplus of power that they have to bolster developer goodwill. I don't think we're putting them on a hypothetical psychiatrist couch, but they do remember it. It's infused their thinking about the company. David Barnard: And we will put a pin in that to come back to as we talk about the more modern era of lawsuits and regulation and everything else like that, but stepping back and walking through the history, you do see a different apple after that. And so Apple does go on to build keynote and pages and numbers and the whole digital hub and they start building more and more of those key pieces of software. I think in part from that scarred time of we want to make sure there's great software for the average user and we're going to bundle it even though that's in conflict with our third party developers. We're going to give things away free or cheap, and you see a different Apple in that early 2000 era of like, we're going to control our destiny. Third party developers are important. We're going to be a platform. We're going to encourage them, but we're going to cover our own bases. We're going to make sure that we're not beholden to these companies in the long run by doing these things. And then kind of the next era as I was going through all of this, and this is where I kind of step into it, is what I was calling the Delicious Era. And there were these at the time, going all the way back to the eighties, kind of smaller passionate developers, but I feel like the heyday of this passionate small developer time was those early 2000s. You had Delicious Monster Building, Delicious Library and Panic and the Omni Group and Rogue Amoeba, and you could probably... Bare Bones, you could probably list another 20 off the top of your head, and there was this kind of renaissance. The iPod started driving more and more people from Windows to the Mac. There were these really passionate kind of fanboy developers building these really cool software for the platform. And as a platform, I feel like there was a bit of a heyday during that time where Apple was kind of... And Sherlocking famously came out of the Watson Sherlock thing in, I think, that was 2020, but there was this kind of heyday leading up to the iPhone of really great independent software creators while at the same time Microsoft and Adobe and others were starting to invest more back into the platform and the Mac becomes this really solid platform in that era. John Gruber: It's a tough thing to strike a balance on. It's almost impossible to just get perfectly right where it's clearly correct for there to be a suite of fundamental apps out of the box in a factory fresh new computer or phone or tablet. And that therefore that 1990 to 1995 Apple mindset of we're hardly going to ship any first party apps and everything will be third party apps because we don't want to step on their toes. And even if we have a subsidiary that makes Mac Write and Mac Draw and stuff like that, or File Maker, we're going to put it in a subsidiary and try to treat it as best we can as an actual third party developer, even though we own the company. That's not the right way to deal with a platform, but obviously Sherlocking every successful app is also not the right mindset. It's a hard balance to strike, and I think they've managed it pretty well, especially... And again, in the early 2000s when Sherlocking first became a term, it was so few years since the era when Apple studiously avoided ever stepping on the toes of third party developers, that it felt like all of this was newly offensive. And here in 2025, that's sort of ancient history. And so people don't think of it that way. So for example, just this month at WWDC, they announced clipboard history management in Sherlock on macOS Tahoe and a sort of more launch bar, Alfred Ray cast style superpowers in Spotlight where you can assign a two letter abbreviation to something to launch a shortcut or something like that. I think that they continue to strike the right balance where I, as a long time launch bar user, I'm glad they're adding those features to Spotlight, but there's 0% chance that I'm switching to Spotlight. I have an example though where here's a market where I feel like they tried to stay away from third parties and I think it bit them and now they're entering late, which is password management. And OnePassword is a great app from a great company that used to make a really great Mac app for passwords, and they're still a good company and the app is still fine. I've never been a user of it, but I see why people are. But the dynamic is the more popular and successful OnePassword came, the more that grew and they grew in interest to want to reach the enterprise market. And that changed the product in a way that made it not so great as a Apple product, an Apple platform product. OnePassword is still a great product, super good at a technical level, super useful in that enterprise context and in terms of some of the family sharing and stuff like that. But it's like if you really want the Mac style interface for password integration and the iPhone style integration and the syncing between the two, it started becoming not as great as it used to be because their interest in growing their market, which is great for the company, were in conflict with making it perfect for the Apple platforms. And so Apple came out with Apple passwords I think last year. I think it's only been a year, maybe it's two years. David Barnard: I don't know. It's been... Well, I mean, the password app, but they've been kind slow rolling into building the password app. John Gruber: It was effectively an app worth more than an app, a serious app worth of capabilities and features, but hidden away in a system settings panel for years, I think out of deference to we don't want to squash this market. But then I think as the market sort of moved into a less and less idiomatic Apple platform style of software, they were like, you know what? We should just make our own app because we could do this in a way that's very Apple-y. And I think now the new passwords app, it's a good introduction to how do you make a modern app for Apple platforms? Any area where they try to stay out of, eventually they find themselves having to enter. David Barnard: Yeah, so this is a huge can of worms that we could spend an hour talking about the balance of Apple, what they ship and what they don't, and what developers' toes they step on and what they don't. Maybe this is a whole nother podcast, but I want to step back and- David Barnard: Maybe this is a whole another podcast. I wanted to step back and see if there was anything else you wanted to share relating to the 2000s in that. I feel like that era did actually set Apple up really well for the iPhone as a platform. The Cocoa frameworks, the passionate developer base, the books that were written. When I started working on iOS, I intended to be the programmer and do it all myself. And so I bought the famous book of the era, Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa frameworks or whatever it was. And so by the time you got to the iPhone, there was this really solid, passionate community. Books being written, conferences being attended. WWDC had grown tremendously, and this era of the 2000s of the Mac becoming this really great platform was a springboard that then propelled the iPhone even faster as a platform than I think it would've otherwise been. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that era before we jump into the iPhone era? John Gruber: The basic mindset in the late '90s in the industry was a sort of consensus that user interface design doesn't matter that much. Nobody would argue it doesn't matter at all, but that Apple's focus on making it the top priority of their platforms wasn't worth it because, okay, let's just concede that the Mac was a better user interface than Windows. Look at their market share. Obviously it didn't matter. It wasn't an unreasonable conclusion, but I think it was wrong-headed because I think that the problem that people arguing that way didn't see yet was that no computer. Again, it comes back to that argument that the iPhone is truly the first real personal computer, the one that every person would want and would care about. At the time, even in the late '90s, too many people making decisions about what computers to buy or what computers a company should buy weren't the people who care that much about user interface and therefore they were buying Windows PCs based on other criteria. Those early 2000s that built up this skill set in designers and developers and built up these teams of either companies or independents or just hobbyists, but at every level who could make software that was like, oh man, just look at it. Remember the Disco app. It was a DVD burning utility. When it burned the DVD, it actually had smoke come out of the window. Some people were like, well, that's just a complete waste of CPU and GPU resources, and other people were like, where do I buy this? I want to buy this because when I burn a CD or DVD, I want smoke to come out of the window because that's just cool and fun. This whole skill set was there for Apple and in 2008 when the app store opened up to build apps that people would just be like, but just look at it. Just look at this. Oh yeah, where do I get that app? I want to get it. It fueled this consumer fervor for the platform that no other platform could even hope to compete with at the time. There was no other platform. Early Android, they just couldn't do it. Microsoft's mobile, Blackberry, whatever. Nobody had the skill set. It was impossible to make anything that was like, just look at it. Just look at this app. Look how cool it looks. David Barnard: Yeah. I hadn't thought about it from that. The design perspective as well. I mean, that's what brought me to iPhone development. We'll move into the iPhone era now, is that I was that uber passionate Apple fanboy, Mac nerd. I had my, I don't even know what it was at the time, in 2007, some PowerBook that I had at the time. I loved the software, I loved the platform. I was first person, not first person in line. Well, I was first person in line to buy an iPhone. I was in line. Again, if you weren't around and weren't a fanboy at the time, it's laughable to think about this at the time, but I stood in line for, I think it was my iOS, Mac OS Tiger or one of those. There would be lines at the Apple Store and OS Update was a launch event. John Gruber: You had to pay $129 for it. David Barnard: Yes. You would line up to pay $120 to upgrade your operating system. It was that passion about the platform at that time that you had people like me and millions of us around the country who cared so deeply about the platform for all of these reasons is that it wasn't just good hardware, it wasn't just the OS, but it was this combination of OS and fun software and delightful, but it was productive. In 2003, I actually bought that 17 inch PowerBook because I was using Photoshop to manipulate this aerial photography for my dad's commercial real estate business. The Windows laptop I was on kept crashing. I was like, dad, I got to get a Mac if you want me to keep working on this stuff. Went and paid for it. The experience was night and day working on Photoshop on a 17-inch PowerBook than it was whatever crappy Windows machine I was using at the time. And so there was this fervor for the platform in that time that I think was the perfect setup. And also coming into the iPhone, there was enough of that groundswell of people like me. I was in China when Apple announced the iPhone. I went to the internet cafe at a Beijing hotel to watch a live blog of the Macworld keynote that you were at when they announced the original iPhone because there was just that level of fervor. And then six months later, my brother and I go get in line to buy the first iPhone. There was that passion, and then by the time they announced the SDK that next year, I jumped into it because I thought this is going to be something. I saw something different about the platform, and so much of that had been built up through Apple's experience across the decades building platforms of the turnaround of the Mac, of building the foundations with Cocoa and stuff like that. That ended up becoming the iPhone. And then by the time the iPhone App Store was released, there was this groundswell of developers who were just so excited about the platform. They could not build an app for this platform. It wasn't just original Mac developers. That was one of the fascinating things, you alluded to it earlier, is that a lot of the Mac developers didn't really do well on the iPhone because they were maybe a little too caught up in what they had built for the Mac. What we saw happen when the App Store launched with so many new companies being built, new ideas being explored, and just this fervor for building for the platform. John Gruber: There was a skill set that transferred immediately where somebody who is really fluent as a developer in Objective-C and the AppKit APIs on the Mac could immediately jump over, because it was just more limited. It was like AppKit but a lot more limited. But in terms of the syntax and the style of the APIs, they could just jump right in and thrive in a way that a developer who's familiar with Java at the time, which was super popular, or the Windows C++ APIs was like, what the hell's going on here with all the square brackets? But in terms of the concepts for what an app should be and do in the scope of it, it wasn't a mini Mac. It still isn't, but especially in 2008, 2009, it just was so much more limited and the context of where and how people would use it was so different that it just at a conceptual level be thinking in a very different way, not quite as profound. But along the lines of the difference between the purely command line interfaces of the early PC era where you just had text on a screen versus a graphical user interface. It was the same difference where it was like, hey, people are just going to sometimes open your app and want to use it like tap, tap done and get out. You could have Mac apps at the time where you'd launch the app and it would show a splash screen. It was a whole term of art like, Photoshop and Adobe apps famously would take 30, 40 seconds to launch because they were such big apps. Well, that made no sense on the iPhone. If you had that mindset like, I have this idea for an app, but it's going to take 20 seconds to launch, well, people would just be like, nah, screw this. I'm hitting the home button and deleting the app before it finished launching. David Barnard: To bring back the developer relations thread, WWDC 2008, which you were at, one of my big regrets in life is not going to WWDC 2008 because I founded my company April of that year to build iPhone apps. I had borrowed money from my family. I felt this tension of am I spending my family's hard-earned money that they've invested in me to go on a vacation to San Francisco to this developer conference? And so I did not go. What I heard in retrospect was that they were actually signing up developer accounts in person at WWDC that year. Could have been there day one had I gone, but this was the first time WWDC ever sold out. I've heard stories about past WWDC. They would be giving away tickets. They would be begging developers to come, and at WWDC 2008 was the first time it sold out. And then from then on, that groundswell of developer and the platform becoming so powerful, they never again had to ask developers to come. It was sold out every year after that, eventually having to go to a lottery. And then there's one more point I wanted to make was that at WWDC 2008, the slides from the presentations had the email addresses of Apple evangelists on the slide because they're like, hey, email us. We need more feedback. We want to know what's going on. Even as successful as the Mac platform had become, this was still pre iPhone Apple and pre the iPhone platform becoming what it became was such a different Apple. Funny story, because I had not gotten a developer account, I sent an email to five of the people- John Gruber: On the slides. David Barnard: On the slides. John Galenzi of all people responded to the email, gave me a phone call. I mean, to this day I remember he actually just retired from Apple. I had a lovely chat with him a couple of weeks ago at WWDC on the side because he's no longer at Apple anymore. John Gruber: No, he's no longer at Apple, but I saw him at WWDC. David Barnard: Yeah. Such an incredible human. But evangelists would put their email on the slides. It's just hard in 2025 how secretive, how close, how we choose you, you don't choose us. How hard it is to get the attention of Apple for the average developer. That was the era before the iPhone platform became so big. John Gruber: It was clearly a surprise to Apple. The whole idea that jobs had to be talked into opening up an API. I think that's overstated a little to some degree. I was going to say how much of that was just him blustering? Well, the difference is between should there be third-party apps for iPhone versus should the iPod support Windows. Now, Jobs wholeheartedly was against supporting Windows. He really was 100% on board with the iPod as a thing to help sell the Mac. Making it a Mac-only peripheral was in Apple's interest because it would bolster the Mac and every other executive from Schiller to whoever else was like, we're holding back the iPod as a platform by not supporting Windows. There's multiple books that he have written about it where he's like, all right, fine, go do it, but don't bother me. I don't want to know about it. And then he called it the iTunes for Windows, the Glass of ice water in hell. He was happy once it came out and he could see it and he could say that, he was happy, but he was really against it. I don't think he was against opening the iPhone, I just think he thought someday. I do think that maybe it happened a little faster than he thought. I don't think he anticipated announcing it in 2007. In fact, at 2007, WWDC was when they announced their "sweet solution" for third party developers, which was a very small JavaScript library where you could make some web apps that looked like native iPhone apps. They wouldn't have announced that in June on the cusp of the iPhone going on sale if they really thought, hey, we're going to have a native SDK early next year. It was September, October where they just made an announcement like, sure, all right, fine. We heard you. We're going to open an SDK. Give us a couple of months to get it together. We'll get back to you when it's ready. I think he thought it was like, we'll get to it in a couple of years, but I think it already was proving more popular and more resonant than he thought. I think Jobs and everybody at Apple knew this iPhone was a hit. They knew it was a thing. They weren't surprised that it was in sensation when they announced it, but it was even more resonant and more of a hit and bled out to more normal people. The iPhone first came out in 2007, right away in the summer of 2007, I'd be at Whole Foods and I'd have a shopping list in a Web App and Randos would just come up to me and be like, is that an iPhone? Is that an iPhone. All the time. I don't think Apple was anticipating that level of broad consumer appeal and it accelerated that. The WWDC thing is a perfect example. Before the iPhone, they had a whole extra track at WWDC. They called it the IT Track for IT professionals who managed Mac installations in corporate environments. It was because they had room, I don't know, I'm just ball parking, 3000 developers, but then 2000 IT professionals and a whole different track of sessions where instead of talking about APIs for making Mac Apps, it was sessions related to the very serious, a reasonable topic for a conference, but it was almost like two conferences in one. One for developers and one for IT professionals, just because they wanted to fill up Moscone and they had room. With the iPhone, it was like, oh, we got to get rid of that. There was this whole resentment because, it was I think a very good and successful and popular conference for IT professionals, but when the popularity of the iPhone happened, it was like, oh, they got to go. And then it became, even Mac developers felt like, hey, this used to be all about the Mac and now it's session after session after session is just about the iPhone. David Barnard: We've talked about a lot of things that are ultimately almost a fluke of history that things played out the way they did from Bill Gates saving Apple and all those things. I can't help but think. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit for it, but very soon after the iPhone was released, the developers jailbroke the iPhone and started writing native apps for it. Craig Hockenberry is one name I will call out. I wonder if that jailbreak scene and seeing what developers were building under insane constraints. Because when you jailbroke, Apple hadn't documented APIs. It wasn't a real SDK. Developers were having to reverse engineer methods they could call and how things were working. I can't help but think that some of jobs changing his mind so quickly was because of how innovative and how passionate that base was. I mean, I ended up buying it. When I started my company, I bought a second iPhone because I was too nervous to jailbreak my own iPhone. I bought a second iPhone, jailbroke it and installed all these apps for me as a way to study what apps could do. It's like you could study as a developer in 2008 before the App Store was launched and you had 500 apps to poke around to see what people were doing. I jailbroke a phone specifically to understand what could be done and what people were doing and what was going on with the platform. I can't help but think that Hockenberry and Steve Troughton-Smith and some of those other early jailbreak folks had an influence on the SDK actually coming out as quickly as it did. John Gruber: Yeah. I think Jobs appreciated that. Lucas Newman, who was at the Luscious library at the time and then went to Apple. I think it got him hired by Apple. I haven't heard from him in a while. I also know that, I think this is a public story, but Lucas Newman wrote the first game. It was called Lights Off, wholly backwards engineered, entirely. Hockenberry came out with a version of Twitterrific that was a native app before the year was out without any SDK from Apple, but building apps for the iPhone through Xcode. Just bananas to me that this happened. But I think Jobs appreciated that mindset because of all the crazy nonsense him and Woz had done back in the day before they founded was. Before they founded Apple making the little blue boxes that would let you make free long-distance calls on a payphone and stuff. The enthusiasm was just so much stronger where it was like they'd be crazy not to hold it back. David Barnard: Then March 6th, 2008 a date seared into my memory, they announced the iPhone SDK. This is again where I think people in 2025 don't appreciate what a different era that was in terms of what was possible as a developer to build a business. I wrote a business investment thesis that I sent to my dad and mom and uncle who ultimately invested in the company. I specifically wrote in there, what an incredible deal this is that I don't have to host my own store. Because back then, I mean, again, so easy to forget in this era of Stripe and AWS back ends and everything like that, that standing up your own web server to distribute apps, especially if it's a larger app, could get very expensive. Bandwidth was expensive. Working with third-party, payment platforms was a hassle. You needed a whole team to sort all that stuff out. And so when Apple announced the iPhone- John Gruber: Especially on a phone, right? David Barnard: Yeah. John Gruber: Credit card would be even harder. There was no way to scan it, no tap to pay. David Barnard: The only software that was on phones at the time was carrier build. You had to do a deal with a carrier and they took 50% of everything. The App Store was genuinely a revolution in software of a revolution of opportunity for developer. I mean, this is what I built my career on. This is why I have such a soft place in my heart and I'm so obsessed to this day with the App Store because it just fundamentally changed the opportunity you had as a developer to build a business. Of course that's not true anymore in 2025 with Stripe and hosted Back ends and Bandwidth being essentially free and all these third-party SaaS tools that you could spin up a Web App. I mean, geez, now even in Vibe coding where you don't even need a backend or hardly any experience to spin up a Web App that's just hosted on Replit. You can charge for it via built-in payment solutions. It's just crazy how much different the world is today than it was for that original App Store release. I think people today forget just how powerful that was. We were talking about this before we hit record trying to do the math. There are kids today, teenagers releasing apps on the App Store whose parents probably weren't even alive when Schiller and Cue and Joswiak joined Apple in the '80s. You could be a 16-year-old developer with a 40-year-old parent who wasn't even alive when all of this started with the Macintosh in 1984, much less 1976 when Apple was founded. I think there is a little bit of a loss of history and then maybe at Apple a little too much recognition of history of here we are in 2025 and the world has completely changed. The iPhone helped change the world 17 years ago, but now it's been 17 years since the world changed. People today looking from the outside without this history, I don't think appreciate the things that Apple appreciates. They don't have the context and the history. I think when you're trying to understand how Apple operates, why they're so insistent on the App Store fees and other things like that, you have to ignore all of that history, which to people's credit they don't even know. That's why we're doing this podcast. To understand Apple, you have to go back those 40 years and see all of what it took to get to the iPhone and then the iPhone becoming the platform it is and the billions and trillions of dollars that the platform has generated for third-party developers, that's hard not to just appreciate. John Gruber: To some extent at this point, it's becoming clear that Apple itself has fallen into the same trap. I'll exemplify it with a quote. I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm hopefully going to soon turn it into some article on Daring Fireball. There's a Steve Jobs quote. It's actually, Apple's made a big plaque of it, huge. It's, I don't know, 10 feet diagonal. It hangs not at Apple Park, but outside the Town Hall Theatre at the old Infinite Loop campus. The quote is, if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next. I think with the App Store in particular, boy that really resonate. It's not that they should forgo all profit and all commissions from the App Store, the whole, well, we started with 70/30. We should stick with 70/30. We've never raised it from 70/30 even when it's become more powerful or more monopoly, whatever you want to call it. David Barnard: As they've increased in control and the platform has increased in importance, they could have increased and squeezed and other things. John Gruber: Right. The people at Apple who are insisting on keeping as much of the commission's and the rules and everything as they have, but especially when it comes to payments and letting people link out to the web and stuff like that. They're thinking, hey, we built this thing that was so much more generous and developer friendly than everything that came before it on handhelds or, especially on phones. That they're still caught up in thinking of what it was in 2008 as opposed to that Jobs's quote, if you build something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. I feel like Apple is dwelling on the success and the innovation, true innovation, profound innovation that absolutely shook up and completely revolutionized the phone industry more than Apple even revolutionized the PC industry, but they're dwelling on it for too long. That they should move on and build something else new and start conceding on that issue. I think it is something that they've lost when they lost Steve Jobs. People think that they lost the ability to make new things, that it was always his ability to drive them to make a new thing. But I think he was good at, okay, fine. Again, I mentioned that whole iPod for Windows thing where he stuck with it for a year or two and then he was like, okay, fine, fine. At some point the people holding onto all of these rules and healing all these decisions about the anti-steering and stuff. Somebody at the top named Tim Cook should probably just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's just give in on a lot of this. We don't have to worry about it anymore. Just clear it off our concerns. I think it would be so good for Apple to just clear it off the table and just clear their time and their energy and their talent from executives down to engineers to just figure out what's next and make something new that would build into something where they have to worry about this again in 10 or 15 years. David Barnard: I want to dig into what I will affectionately call App Store 3.0 because I completely agree, but let's step back one more point in history. I have a bunch of notes. We could go through all of the early iPhone days. It's hard for people who don't even know that there weren't in-app purchases, that you had paid upgrades. That in order to do a paid upgrade, you had to release a whole new app and then transition users to it. There's so many points on the App Store history of just oddities and stubbornness and weird things that Apple did in those early days, even as the platform started taking off. But in 2016, Phil Schiller did a round of interviews. I think the one that most concisely covers it, maybe the one he gave the most access to was Verge. They titled the article App Store 2.0. And so in hindsight now I will give this way more credit than I think I did at the time of, it really was App Store 2.0. It really did fuel what we see as the current era of the platform. They open up subscriptions to all apps, which obviously working at RevenueCat and now all my apps are subscription. I know some users still bulk at it, but from a developer's perspective and being able to fund the creation of great software and continue working on it, that was revolution. That was App Store 2.0 to empower developers to better monetize apps. They sped up app review significantly. Again, if you weren't around a decade ago, you don't remember the days when it was seven days, 14 days to get an app through App Review. As much as you might complain about App Review today, at least you get that rejection in 24 hours to 48 hours instead of seven to 14 business days. They dropped the commission to 15% on year one renewal. If you started a subscription, that first commission would be 30, and then after that would be 15%. They announced App Store search ads as a new way to pay to get users. As much as we can complain about name squatting and having to pay to defend your brand, it's an incredible opportunity to be able to pay and get in front of people right there in the App Store. It's actually the paid acquisition channel that I recommend any App Store with. If you're struggling to get downloads, the first thing you should do is start figuring App Store search ads. That was App Store 2.0. They started removing a lot of these old apps that weren't working or just crappy apps. They started to purge the App Store and curate it a little bit more. That was App Store 2.0 in 2016. Looking back now almost a decade since. It really was a profound shift in the App Store that has led to so much of what we now get to experience as the App Store would not have happened had they not loosened the reins in those ways and made those changes. And so as much as we talk about, I complain on Twitter about Apple being obstinate and not changing and being stuck in the past and everything like that. The App Store 2.0 was them changing. Did they go on an apology tour? Did they, whatever? No. But they made very fundamental changes to the App Store that propelled it for this last decade. To your point, this is what I want to get back to today in 2025, is that it really does feel like we are in need of App Store 3.0, a deeper, more fundamental rethink of the opportunity. I think to your point, get out of the way. Let developers build. I think the Vision Pro is a good example too of the animosity that has started to build up. The frustrations and everything has gotten to a point where developers are way more wary of Apple. You posted some really great posts this spring, Apple, you're killing my vibe, and then another one by John Siracusa, just about developers seeing Apple more and more as a inconvenience to reaching their users versus a partner in building this incredible platform. The iPhone continues to sell like hotcakes. Apps are making money hand over fist. Developers are building apps, new apps every day. From the outside and looking at the numbers, maybe the platform is fine, but I think this sentiment where developer relations are in 2025 with the lawsuits, with the DMA, with all of the things that are going on, it feels like we're due another reset. Personally, I would love to that be a little bit more like the '97 jobs of like, hey, we did some things that we thought were right at the time and the forthrightness to say, here's why we think this. Here's why we did it. We're changing our mind. We're going to focus on building these great platforms moving forward. What does Apple need for the next decade and the decade after a vibrant developer community who's going to jump on the next day AI platform. Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are tromping at the bit and have billions of dollars to invest to not let this next platform play out the way the smartphone platform played out with Apple having so much control and so much power, maybe it's time for a bigger change. John Gruber: It's just proven so lucrative and forms the backbone of their services, "services that they report financially," which has been their growth vector for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years. Not because interest in the iPhone has decreased, but because clearly the iPhone is literally so popular that every single person in the world who lives somewhere where the iPhone is available and they can afford one and they want one has one. It's that popular that it has peaked because they've run out of people to sell it to. To their credit, it's part of the appeal that they build them to last. That's good for the environment. It's good as just a message that they're durable and the silicon is so good that five, six-year-old iPhones are still very credible devices. I'm running iOS 26 on an iPad from 2018, iPad Pro. It is a little slow. That's a seven-year-old device. The "services" has been their growth for the last seven or eight years. A lot of that comes not, they would like you to think that it's from Apple services, from people paying for iCloud and paying for Apple TV+ and whatever else they sell as a service. But a lot of it comes from their commission from the App Store, but they could decrease their cut and they could open up instead of fighting for these anti-steering things, especially going to the web stuff, which I've been against for years and years. I mean, pretty much ever since it became an issue that this is ridiculous. Especially like in the Kindle exemplifies it. That if the terms of the App Store are such that the Kindle App cannot sell app or books in the app without losing money on each book, which is the way the e-book publishing industry works, where there's a 70/30 split between the bookseller and the publisher and therefore if there's a 70/30 split between the publisher and the platform, they literally lose money on each sale that they'd owe. A $10 book, they would owe $3 to Apple, but they would owe $7 to the publisher and therefore at best would make nothing, so why do it? If you can't sell books through the app because of the terms of your store, you should absolutely let them have a button that says, go here to go buy books on the Kindle website. The idea that they fought that is, it's just absurd, and clearly anti-user. It just exemplifies how they've gotten caught up in thinking way too much that the point of the App Store is for Apple to get a commission on all digital content sales for the platform as opposed to what it should be and could be and should remain going forward, which is... John Gruber: ... could be and should remain going forward which is us maintaining control and having approval over the software and the APIs and what can happen in the background and how things are managed and how privacy is managed in the sandbox and everything is the best for the platform long-term and very much the best interest of the users. It should be that thinking. And then, the fact that we make a lot of money but maybe not as much money for all digital content on the platform because we do have and one of the ways you can do in-app purchases should be icing on the cake, which is clearly how they thought of it at the outset and they should just go back to thinking that. And I really do think that if and when they do, and I think it's a big if, but... And not at the point of regulation. Because if it's at the point of regulation, we see it. They're just going to make it convoluted and complex and the only way this knot is going to get untied is for Apple to willingly say, "You know what? We're going to lower the rate to 80-20 for everyone and 90-10 for small business," or something like that, "And we're going to just drop... If you want to send people outside the app to the web to make the purchases, just give them a button and they'll go to the web to do it." If they did that, I honestly think they would not see a significant decrease. And I think we're going to see that proved out in the coming months and quarters as Apple releases their quarterly finance statements after the recent ruling here in the US, their biggest market, that allows stuff like that. I don't think we're going to see a decrease in services revenue, now that they've been forced to open this up. So why not just open it up worldwide and make it easier for everyone and stop hanging the sword of Damocles over everybody that, "Hey, if we win an appeal in a year or two, we're going to revoke this access that you've now gotten at the point of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' legal declaration." It's better for the platform. Just make people happy. Make developers happy and users happy and Apple will profit from it. They really will. David Barnard: It does seem like dropping the fee would be a huge change in developer relations, in developer sentiment. I would hope they would go all the way down to 85-15 and I think there's Ben Thompson- John Gruber: And maybe something different for games maybe because- David Barnard: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Maybe games stay at 70-30 because that's what Sony and Nintendo and Steam and everybody else charges. Except for Epic with their App Store, but they obviously have reasons to artificially put that lower. But I can't help but think it would change the tone with the industry more broadly and be more in line with the reality of 2025. Now, you can argue, well, you're not just paying for payment fees. I think that's a disingenuous argument that a lot of people make. It's like, "Oh, Stripe is 3%. Why should we be paying Apple 30% for payments?" Well, you're not paying Apple 30% for payments and this is the argument Apple continues to make is that it's a platform fee. But there's a couple of things in there. One, it's almost a fluke of history that Jobs, in that original iPhone announcement said, "Hey, if you have a free app, we're going to distribute it for free and it doesn't cost you anything." And at the time, that was great and that created companies like Facebook and Uber and others where they might not have been able to make it work. Well, Facebook is a bad example because they were already reasonably profitable, but the iPhone certainly did springboard them even further. John Gruber: Yeah. But I would argue that the company is... It's not just that they adjusted and adapted to mobile. Meta, today, is unrecognizable from the Facebook of 2007. And in hindsight, they were clearly meant for mobile. To the point where they've got products that people use entirely on mobile, right? You can technically use Instagram on the web, but the vast majority of Instagram users have never once used it on the web. David Barnard: But would Instagram exist as it is today if they had to pay 50 cents per download or had to pay per user? John Gruber: Right, right. It is a quirk that Apple... Because Apple was coming at it from the mindset of the way the Mac worked. That there were free apps, but that any company that wanted to run the business from the app would be selling copies of the app. You'd buy the app before you installed it and that was Apple's mindset. And again, they were selling copies of their operating system at the time. If you bought a Mac that had Mac OS 10.2 installed and wanted to upgrade to 10.3, it cost $129 and it cost 100 some dollars or I don't even know what it cost to get Pages and Numbers and Keynote. All of that stuff was for sale for what would, today, strike people as bananas amounts of money and that was their thinking of how software would be sold. And I think the idea of a company and... Meta exemplifies it. That a company, like one of the five biggest companies in the world purely making software... Well, I mean I know they have got the glasses and stuff now too. But like Microsoft, primarily a software company, would be making all their money by giving apps away and only having ads in the app? It just didn't compute at the time and they never foresaw that... It's sort of a loophole. And if it costs them 50 cents a download per user per year, they could afford that very easily. David Barnard: They could. But then, would Instagram have been created? So many companies who have been built on top of it, could they have done it? But in 2025, when you look at the state of the world of Airbnb making billions of dollars, Uber making billions of dollars, Meta making billions of dollars, Google making billions of dollars on the iOS platform and not having to pay a penny other than $100 a year developer account. And here I am, indie developer supporting my family. I've paid Apple over a million dollars. I think closing in on $2 million in my 17-year history. Is that fair? And in the world of 2025, that just seems bananas like, "Why have I paid Apple $2 million for my dinky little indie apps and Meta has paid Apple $100 a year for 17 years?" It's bizarre. If you erase 40 years of history, if you erase all the context that we've built up to this point, and you just look at it as a logical person in 2025, that just seems bananas that I am paying so much to Apple and Meta is paying zero. John Gruber: I do think that was some of the thinking behind the core technology fee for the EU DMA compliance plan where it was sort of like, "What would we do if we did it all over again?" And I think that 50 cents per user per year fee for million plus download apps only was sort of thinking this is what they would do all over again. But the irony of that is that they're even walking away from that now, because the EU has said that the CTF is not compliant with the DMA. So they're switching to a core technology fee or commission which, again, is only on in-app purchases. So again, if you have a super popular app like Instagram that you can use without ever making a digital goods transaction through it, Apple makes nothing but the $100 a year developer fee. I do think they are thinking of it and they tried. The CTF was sort of their attempt but it is sort of a tricky position. But I think the answer to that is, "Hey, maybe you should just be happy that you own this platform and not worry about how much money you make from it," and, again, like that Steve Jobs quote. And just make something else wonderful and go on and really refocus on getting developers to say, "If I didn't have to answer to my boss or what I'm telling my boss and manager, I think we should do is put our efforts into making awesome software for these Apple platforms." To get that developer enthusiasm back I think is worth more to the company than whatever money they're making by breeding pure resentment with the current policy. And I don't want to let it slide, because you mentioned it but I want to emphasize it, that one of those differences between visionOS today and the original Mac in 1984, 1985 at this point based on where we are in visionOS's life, is that even though the Mac wasn't popular in 1985, there was this blossoming ecosystem of Native Mac software, even though the market share wasn't there. Because of the enthusiasm developers had who were like, "Oh my god. People..." It just clicked in their heads like, "This is the computer of the future. I want to make software for it." And we're not seeing that for Vision. We really aren't. There are cool apps and it's not a dead platform but it's nowhere near... visionOS today is nowhere near as vibrant a third party developer ecosystem as the Mac was in 1985 or 1986. And I think that should be the red flag for Apple and I think they might be a little surprised by that. I don't think they're surprised by the number of Vision Pro headsets they've sold, but I think they are a little disappointed and surprised by the lack of developer enthusiasm for the platform. And I think it's entirely because developers are so resentful of the way that Apple has treated them, specifically around finance and payments, that sort of thing. We can argue about the rules on background processing and stuff like that in sandboxing and stuff that apps would like to do. But it's really the resentment... First and foremost, numbers one, two, and three on the list of reasons why developer relations are strained with Apple has to do with money. Anybody who says otherwise is wrong. And Apple doesn't need money. Again, they are not operating on narrow profit margins. Their profit margins have gone up, not down. David Barnard: This is the tricky point though and this is me listening to too much Ben Thompson, but the tricky thing for Apple at this stage though is that the services revenue is so important to the growth narrative around the stock. That even though they don't need the money, they need the money to continue growing the stock at the pace it's growing. And that's the rock and a hard place that they've gotten themselves into is that the services narrative is so strong and that quarter-over-quarter growth in services revenue and services profit when the hardware has kind of started to flatline a little bit- John Gruber: I don't want to interrupt you. But it's like the Exxon Mobil's of the world ran into this problem when they were on top of this market cap lists where it's like, "Well, how many more cars and motorcycles and airplanes consuming fossil fuels could we have, right?" It's like everybody who could have one had one and they're not going to make cars that purposefully consume more fuel. There comes a point where a product or a service or a category really does max out in terms of human population and it's a good place to be. But if your mindset as a Wall Street investor is growth, growth, growth, how much more could they grow, right? David Barnard: Yeah. And maybe this is where we need to go back to this Steve quote from 1997 and maybe the message is as much to Wall Street as it is to developers and Apple saying to Wall Street, "We're going to need to take some lumps, potentially like you and I have said, I mean, if they dropped the fee to 15%, would they lose money? Maybe, but maybe Netflix would come back to the App Store. Maybe... In my job at RevenueCat, I talk to so many developers who are just, "Web, web, web, web, web. We're trying to push as much as we can to the web. We're going to experiment with pushing out of the app into the web now because it's more profitable. We want to save on that 30%." And so, if they drop the fee and it just didn't even make sense to charge on the web. Because at RevenueCat, we did some experiments and Netflix did some experiments with Apple, early in the Epic case, I think it came out that their number was somewhere around that like 12 to 13%. Where if the fee had been dropped that low, it would still be more profitable to operate in the App Store than outside the App Store. And then, there's a lot of complicating factors now too of owning the relationship and would Netflix want Apple to be an intermediary? Well, guess what? If Apple were a more friendly intermediary, maybe they wouldn't mind so much and they would just pick the one that was more profitable on the dollar for dollar basis. John Gruber: We know it's a solvable problem because there are more platforms for signing up customers that give the owner of the service, the newsletter, the streaming service, the music service, whatever it is, more direct relationship with their customers. We've seen them built, so Apple could obviously build one into the App Store. Instead of making all these entitlements over linkouts and stuff like that make it an entitlement where you kind of have to qualify and have these restrictions on, "Well, do you have a customer service department? What's your refund policy? We're going to enforce that you have a customer friendly refund policy where you don't have to call a 1-800 number and listen to somebody try to talk you out of unsubscribing. We're going to test it. That's part of app review, where it has to be as easy to unsubscribe as to subscribe. Otherwise, we will pull your entitlement." But then, if you qualify on those terms and you have those policies in place, you can have more of a direct relationship with your customers. Do whatever it takes to make developers happy to be building for the Apple platforms. Instead, they're clearly focusing on, how can we extract a decent enough portion of the revenue that's conducted on these platforms? David Barnard: Yeah. And so, taking liberties with the Steve Jobs quote from '97, "Apple's going to need to take some lumps in the coming months, but we're going to take it like an adult and I'm proud of that. And the result of that focus, focusing more on developers and building a fantastic platform over extracting as much revenue as we can from that platform, we and third party developers are going to build some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." I shitpost on Twitter about Apple all the time and I know a lot of people inside Apple don't like me for some of those posts. But what I care about deeply is this App Store platform- John Gruber: Join the club. David Barnard: Yeah. You recently. It's that you and I care unreasonably about this platform. On an earlier podcast with Ben Thompson, I love this quote from him, he said, "It just breaks my teenage heart to see Apple continuing down this path that it's going on." And I think that you and I both have gotten to this level of frustration with developer relations and what Apple's doing and the way they're operating. Not because we hate Apple and want to see them fail. And not because we're just take joy in ridiculing them or complaining and criticizing them publicly. It's just that we care so deeply and we see the path that they're on and we don't think it's right. And if you take these 40 years of history, you can kind of justify things and you can see how internally they can justify it and see it this way and see it that way. John Gruber: Somehow, they've gotten attached to this income that they've extracted from commissions in the App Store in a way that they've never been attached to other things. I mean, you and I mentioned this during this podcast about the upgrade charge they used to charge for operating systems, $129 to go from Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4. They used to charge $5 to upgrade iOS. They clearly, at that time, were trying to get away from it, but they thought the accounting rules they were trying to follow required them to do it. They've given up on that knowing that it was better for them overall. In theory, you think, "Well, why would you ever... If people were doing it and lining up outside Apple stores to buy boxed versions of the software for $129 to upgrade their existing Mac, why would you ever do away with that if it was so popular that they were lining up?" But in the grand scheme of things, it clearly was the right decision to just make the operating system upgrades free to encourage all users to upgrade and to sort of steer them towards automatic updates, because they can do that because they're not charging. They couldn't do the automatic OS updates that most people, with their default settings on a Mac or iPad or iPhone, just at some point a couple months after the dot O, there's a version they think is stable enough. And overnight, while your phone's charging, you get the new... You're going to have iOS 26 in November or December this year. And they can only do that because they're not charging for it and it's better for them overall. Obviously, they've never made more money, their profits and revenue are at record highs. I think the same thing is true of the commissions in the App Store that, yes, at some level, if you're the CFO at Apple, you're like, "Well, why in the world would we ever decrease this? If we don't legally have to, why would we ever give up a penny of it? It's a lot of money." But it'll all work out in the end in terms of... And Joz himself has mentioned this in multiple of the interviews he did do last month at WWDC. He said the same thing to me and it was an off the record briefing I had with him and it was very cordial and nice. I am sure he won't mind me repeating it because he mentioned it on the record with Joanna Stern and multiple people where one of the things Steve Jobs often said, "If we make great products and tell people about them," that's the marketing part from his perspective, "tell them why they're great, it'll all work out in the end." That's just as true of the App Store as anything else, but it's this one area where they've got a compulsive institutional obsession with squeezing it that they do not need. David Barnard: And speaking of flukes of history, one of the... I think it was an epic case found an email from Schiller to Jobs saying, "What if we cap App Store revenue to Apple at $100 dollars?" Which at the time seemed- John Gruber: No, I think it was a billion. I think it was a billion- David Barnard: Was a billion? Okay. John Gruber: I think it was a billion. David Barnard: Or even a billion. It was like at the point in time when he wrote that, it probably sounded crazy like, "How will we ever make that much money on the App Store?" But then now, in hindsight it's like, "Oh my gosh. That's such a tiny amount to what they're making now." But had Jobs been convinced of that and had they announced publicly, "We're going to cap Apple's revenue on the App Store-" John Gruber: Or even if they never announced it publicly, David Barnard: Right. It became internal policy. John Gruber: Yeah. And that once it hit a billion, they dropped it to 75-25 and it stayed at a billion and it was growing some more and then they could drop it to 80-20. Then eventually, 85-15. Who knows? By now, they'd probably be at 90-10 or 93-7 or something like that. And at certain level then without ever having announced that, they could stop. If it had ever gotten even to 90-10, they could stop and say, "Well, now, we can just sort of let it grow because 10 is pretty fair." And yes, it's not the 2.7% Stripe takes or whatever, but 7% is arguably pretty good deal for everything the App Store offers. David Barnard: And imagine how different the last decade of developer relations would have been had Apple capped it at that. And then, the incentive wasn't for the financial side of things. The incentive was to build a fantastic platform for developers and empower them to serve our customers and keep innovating. John Gruber: And encourage developers and designers and even the companies and managers at those... Who aren't nerds and are into the platform, but just to encourage as much as they can, the mindset of, "Maybe we should build this for Apple platforms exclusively, because of the great APIs and capabilities and... Why even bother with these other platforms? We don't make any money on them. We're doing so great iOS only." They've really gotten away from that. It's to Apple's benefit in obvious ways to have as many developers as possible making Apple platform exclusive software. And at this point, there's such a resentment that to so many people, whether they're managers or executives or developers or just users who are like, "Well, you'd be crazy to build for Apple only because they're sort of against you in terms of trying to just take your money." David Barnard: As a long-term Apple watcher and being friends with so many developers. What do you think it would take? Is a reset even in the cards for Apple at this point? Would it take Phil Schiller on stage at the iPhone 18 whatever- John Gruber: They don't do anything on stage- David Barnard: ... keynote. Well, you're right. But what would it take to get a reset? Above the... I mean- John Gruber: I don't know. David Barnard: ... the money would probably go a long way like, "Okay. We're just going to drop the rate." But it does almost feel like there needs to be some level of that 1997 Jobs' humility of like, "Hey, we made some mistakes. You're going to see a new Apple moving forward." John Gruber: Yeah. But I think you don't have to do it... I don't think it's within Apple to say, "We made some mistakes and we're going to change," even though that's sort of how he addressed. He was willing to say that at WWDC 1997 because what they were scrapping were things that weren't under him, right? OpenDoc and Newton and everything else they scrapped. They weren't Jobs-led post next reunification projects. The Apple way of doing it would be to act like, "We've come up with this amazing new idea that only Apple could do and it's totally innovative and nobody else has ever suggested it before. And it's called taking less money from the App Store," right? And not apologizing and not saying... Presenting it as a new opportunity in the same way that they're pitching the liquid glass of iOS 26 as, "Hey, the capabilities of the hardware and the GPU and the screen display technology with HDR is such that we're able to present this interface that we couldn't have done before." Just present it as the market opportunities and the success of the iPhone are such that we're able to have a new financial set of rules around the App Store that we couldn't have done before, even though they could have. But just say that they couldn't. David Barnard: It's just frustrating on a human level. It's like at work, when I do something stupid or whatever, you apologize. There's just humanity in that level of humility that it is just frustrating to me on a human level. John Gruber: But that would count as an apology, right? It would. Because we'd know. David Barnard: For us as Apple followers, it would. But I think in 2025, the press would have a field day with that and just call BS in a way that I don't know that it would work. And this is kind of something I've been thinking more and more is that Apple needs to do some things on Apple, like to adjust to the realities of 2025 and to set themselves up for the next decade as a platform for developers as a consumer brand and everything else. For example, the small business program was so freaking Apple-like. Instead of just saying, "Hey, 15% for the first million, 30% for everything after," there was all these rules. You got to get into the program and then you get kicked out of the program and they created all these weird... To me, that's just the perfect example of how Apple over does things. And so, to usher in an App Store 3.0, I think we need to see them do things un-Apple-like. And I think that... Again, it's the fanboy in me just wanting to see a new version of Apple. Not that I hate Apple, not that I think they're idiots inside Apple, not that I think anything poor of them as a company, I want to see them succeed. I want to wear Apple glasses, not Meta glasses with a camera on them. And I think there's aspects of what they're building and the trust they've built with consumers and everything else that is setting them up for potentially being that next human computing platform. But having developers on your side and enthusiastic about it is going to be a huge, huge, huge boon. And given how competitive Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are and will be in the coming years, maybe it does require a bit deeper of a reset and doing some things that aren't traditionally how Apple operates. I think even this WWDC was a little bit of a reckoning in that Ben Thompson got it, you got it. Some people got it like, "Hey, this is Apple not overpromising so that they can overdeliver." But the press had a field day with like, "Oh, it's a boring..." They're so far behind on AI and all that kind of stuff. John Gruber: Nobody remembers that though. I mean, it's news for a week and here we are a month out and I think it's already forgotten. And I think Apple should have the fortitude, and the wisdom and you've mentioned at the outset, that their leadership's been there for so long. They remember this, they know how it goes, and they should just be confident in themselves in that way. The other thing about the fact that so many of the senior leaders have been there for so long, it means that most of them are nearing retirement. Schiller has stepped down and is in a different position as an Apple fellow. He still runs events, he still runs the App Store. Tim Cook is... I forget how many. What year? 64 or something like that? Or 63. Eddy Cue and Joz are in their 60s. And I'm not saying any of them are leaving soon. I mean, I'm sure none of them are going to pre-announce their retirements. But in terms of setting things up for the next generation of senior leadership at Apple, which is coming sooner rather than later, right? It's coming over the next decade, across the board, I think that they need to reset the institutional priorities of the company, because the new generation won't have that experience from the '90s that you brought up on this show to explain this. And instead if they took over right now, will just have the mindset of, "Oh, the way Apple works is they expect 30% of all the money on the platform." That's just the way it is and that they don't have any history behind it or why, but that they think that. As opposed to thinking that the most important thing Apple should do is encourage stoke and keep going in an ongoing relationship developer enthusiasm for building exclusive software for our platforms. And making it as great as possible and thinking, "Some of the best software experiences on our platforms are going to come from our third party developers, not from Apple." And that that's the way it should be. And we shouldn't be thinking that all of the best software comes from Apple and it's an afterthought what third parties make. David Barnard: And to your point, I hadn't thought of this until you've brought it up, that in setting things up for the future, I think there is onus on the current executives to not hold on to the past for the next decade when it's then too late. They're in the position, today, and having been at Apple 40 years... But one of the impressive things about Meta these past decade is that as a founder-led company, Zuckerberg put $100 billion into Reality Labs and is force of will and telling shareholders, "Hey, we're making these massive investments and they're going to pay off." And now, he's doing the same with AI, $100 million checks to lure AI talent. That's not something the stock market normally would reward, but he is out there pitching the world that, "Hey, this is an investment worth making and we're going to make it." And I think these Apple executives who've been there 40 years are the best people to say and convince the world, "Hey, we need to make some investments on the developer front and that's going to involve less services revenue," or whatever it has to be. But it's going to pay off in spades in the long run with the innovation that's going to happen with the renewed developer sentiment and everything else. That they're going to need for this next big platform in the coming 5 to 10 years. And it may be too late if they hold on. John Gruber: Well, I agree. David Barnard: Well, I think that's a fantastic place to wrap it up. And really, what I wanted to say on this podcast and hopefully people have gotten that depth of history of when you're frustrated with Apple about this policy or that, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than... And I mean even, again, as much as I complain on Twitter, I'll acknowledge that I lack a ton of context and I lack a lot of insight. And I'm sure I can understand why people inside Apple are frustrated at the way I frame things sometimes. But when you take all of that history and everything else into account, something needs to change. I'm not sure exactly what that is and me lobbying is me just throwing out ideas. Happy to be wrong about any of this, anything I'm suggesting. But I hope it's helpful to folks to better understand Apple in these ways. John Gruber: If there's one other point that I'll close with, it would be that I mentioned earlier that the problem Apple found itself in the early '90s when Jobs was exiled was this they were caught in this '80s mindset of every couple years, a new platform replaces the old platform and the old platform goes away. When, in fact, the Macintosh was here to stay and they just weren't treating it that way. I'd say Apple's come full circle now and views its platforms as institutions that are there to last decades, including, well, all of the platforms that they have. Including the Mac, which started in 1984. But the iPhone certainly, iPad, even the lesser ones like Watch and tvOS And I think visionOS are things that they intend to last for decades which, at this point, will last well past the careers of the senior leadership at the company. And I think they have that mindset. But I think they're currently doing some things and, again, related to money, just the goddamn money, that are contrary to fostering that. But it's this long-term mindset that the company has that these platforms are institutions and that Apple at a whole is an institution that is meant to be here for a very long time. David Barnard: And if they don't change... Or maybe they don't have to change, I don't even know. John Gruber: But I think if they don't change, then when new things come, they become legacy only. They're not going to disappear. The iPhone is not going anywhere. But the risk to the company is that they become legacy only maybe like Microsoft would be if they hadn't moved to the cloud, right? If Microsoft was still just about Windows and Office and stuff like that, where they would be? They would miss out on the next thing. That their next thing isn't going to hit unless they have developer buy-in. And that you can easily disguise that with the ongoing revenue and profits from those legacy things. In the same way that Microsoft would still be a very big healthy company, even if they hadn't shifted under Satya Nadella, but they wouldn't be number two or number one in the world right now. David Barnard: Yeah. All right. Well, it's been two and a half hours. I think we do need to wrap up but fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time, John, and this was- John Gruber: Thanks for having me. David Barnard: Glad to have you. John Gruber: This was fun. David Barnard: I really enjoyed it and I hope it's useful to folks. John Gruber: I won't feel so bad the next time you're on my show for two hours. David Barnard: Thanks so much for listening.

On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we might need an ‘App Store 3.0’ reset. Top Takeaways: 🕹️ The 1980s: Apple’s developer DNA was born Apple’s earliest wins came from nurturing third-party developers, even spinning off its own apps to avoid competing with outsiders. 💸 Microsoft saved Apple (literally) Apple’s near-bankruptcy in the ’90s made them both humble and wary—forever shaping how they deal with developers and competition. 🍎 From “please build for us” to “we choose you” WWDC 2008 saw Apple begging for apps and evangelist emails on slides; today, it’s the other way around. 🖥️ The “Delicious Era” fueled iPhone success Mac indie devs (Panic, Delicious Monster, Bare Bones) built a design-obsessed, passionate community—setting the stage for the iPhone App Store boom. 🚪 App Store 1.0: A new world for indies For the first time, solo developers could launch businesses from home. No server costs, no payments hassle—just build, submit, and sell. 🏦 Apple’s rules got stricter as the App Store grew As the App Store became a services giant, the partnership vibe faded. Developers went from partners to “users” of Apple’s marketplace. 📉 App Store math now feels upside down Today, indie devs can pay Apple millions, while giants like Meta pay almost nothing. The fee logic and incentives don’t fit 2025. ⏳ The platform needs an “App Store 3.0” reset John and David call for a new era: lower fees, clearer rules, and Apple acting as a true platform partner—not just a toll booth. 🔄 Developer enthusiasm is Apple’s long-term moat Apple risks becoming a “legacy only” giant if it loses developer goodwill. The most important apps are still built by outsiders. 👥 A generational handoff is coming With Apple’s senior leadership nearing retirement, now is the time to set new priorities: empower developers, invest in the ecosystem, and ensure Apple’s platforms stay vibrant for decades to come.

My guest today is John Gruber, Raconteur, Apple aficionado, podcast host and sole proprietor of Daring Fireball. On the podcast, I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple's developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the '90s shaped today's control-focused approach and why we might need an App Store 3.0 reset. Hey, John, thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. John Gruber: Well, you've been on my show. I hope to have you on my show again soon, so it's the least I can do. I'm happy to be here. David Barnard: So today, I want to talk Apple Kremlinology, which I think is maybe a great term. I just threw it out there. Apple is such a unique organization that... And for most developers, it's like our most important partner. And I'm doing air quotes for those listening on the podcast. And I don't think a lot of people understand Apple, and I think a lot of how people interact with Apple, what they think of Apple is shaped by just not understanding them, which is maybe on Apple. But that's what I wanted to talk about today was better understanding Apple. And I think of all the people to have this conversation with, it's going to be really fun to have it with you. John Gruber: I appreciate that and only because, and I hate to flatter myself. I really do. I really do. I try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like that's what keeps me in the game. But understanding Apple to me is maybe one of the top three things I have. I really.... David Barnard: Yeah. Yeah, totally. John Gruber: And there's always been an intuitive, oh, I love this company vibe fit and some other rolls of the dice of the way my life could have worked out surely on many of the other rolls of the dice. I end up working at Apple for some amount of time, possibly a very short amount of time, because every time I've ever had a job in my life where I actually am not self-employed has not lasted all that long. So probably not long, but one of my earliest memories, I think it was either fifth or sixth grade, which was early '80s, probably like 1983, '84, I just remember reading a story about Apple Computer and I knew at the time that I liked Apple Computers better than other company's computers, and I loved computers. But I remember reading a story about the company and reading that all of the employees just show up to work in sneakers and jeans and T-shirts and that they wear clever T-shirts and they make. Every time they start a new project, the first job is to print up T-shirts for the team for the new project, and then they wear them to work. And I remember thinking, that's awesome because I don't want to wear a freaking suit and tie to work. And I remember telling my dad this and my dad telling me, "John, there is no way that a major computer company lets the people show up to work in jeans and T-shirts." And I was like, "No, I'm telling you, dad, I read it in a magazine. It's true." David Barnard: That's awesome. And then not to flutter myself, but while we're... We should have scripted this, and I should have done this for you and you should have done this for me, but I relied on ChatGPT pretty heavily to do research for the show because I wanted to go really in-depth in the history of Apple and their relationships with developers. And last night, I'm getting through my notes and ChatGPT says, "Three of the prominent voices in App Store related topics are John Gruber, Ben Thompson and David Barnard." And I don't know if it knew it was me and was freaking trying to flatter me or whatever, but I mean, similar to you in a way that the App Store is something I'm unreasonably passionate about. I have an emotional attachment to the App Store and care so deeply about it. And in part, and you know I've discussed this, I was a recording engineer and I knew that was kind of a dead end as far as having a family and being able to provide and stuff like that. But I was a huge Apple nerd, so I got a 17-inch PowerBook in 2003. So my Apple journey begins a little later. I mean, I used them in college and I played with a original Mac in the '80s, but my real Apple fanboyism started in 2002, 2003. So I jumped right into the App Store in 2008 thinking, "Okay, this is an opportunity to build a real career that's going to provide for my family." And it did. I'm 17 years into owning an app business and I care so deeply about the store and then also care so deeply about Apple. And so everything we're going to talk about today, it's like you being one of the people who cares the most about Apple, who's outside Apple, and me, one of the people who cares the most about the App Store outside of Apple, I think is the two right people to have this kind of conversation. And maybe we should have had Ben on and to have a third voice, but... John Gruber: There are certain things that I just remember which years they were, and I just remember that 2007 iPhone no App Store, 2008 App Store comes out. 2009, it really takes off and coincides really with the go-go years of Twitter. And that's absolutely 100%, there's no confusion. I mean, maybe you sent me an email at daringfireball.net or something, but where I remember getting to know you was on Twitter, and I just remember like it's one of the great privileges of my position doing what I do with Daring Fireball where it's like, "Oh, I'm going to get to know this guy," and we'd at each other on Twitter about App Store issues, but I was like, "This guy," I could sense both your profound enthusiasm for it and the way that it was making you... It wasn't making a fanboy of the App Store where no matter what you wanted to say, "Oh, I love the App Store. So no matter what, I'm going to make my conclusion, whatever changes they make are great." Your enthusiasm was such that you're like, "I want to understand every single thing about this to the deepest degree." And again, it's sort of like a laziness where I'm like, "Oh, if I become friends with this guy," and I've got a Rolodex of people who are experts on whatever, it could be AppKit, could be UIKit, could be the App Store, could be... And you're at the top of the list for the App store and have been since 2009 and probably should have been since 2008. But I just remember, 2009, you were just a key follow on Twitter for App Store related stuff, and it was such a fascinating time, explosive, just an explosive time. David Barnard: Well, and I was a Gruber fanboy, and you linking to my app in the fall of 2008, I think wasn't part of turning point. I mean, they were key people who helped me along the way, including people inside Apple. And I remember vividly... John Gruber: It was the Launcher app, right? What was it called? David Barnard: No, no, no, this was 2008. You linked to my mileage logging app. When the App Store launched, there was this terrible Windows phone ish, horrible user interface, no kind of Mac or iOS interface paradigm, a mileage log. They got there first, which is still eats me to this day. 17 years later, I missed the launch of the App Store because Apple did not approve my developer account. And so a month later, I release a mileage log, it was like we follow the iOS paradigms, I mean, looking back, I don't ever feel like I had the best taste, but I didn't have... It was brown and it was not the prettiest or most, but it was iOS. We used the paradigms of iOS. We built a native app. And so you link to that in the fall of 2008, and it was a turning point. John Gruber: Well, I'm happy, I remember that. And that was the other thing that I remember about you is it wasn't just that you were obsessive about the App Store, is that you actually had skin in the game, and that you clearly... Again, I'm not just trying to butter you up here, but no, but there was at that time, at the very highest level when they first announced the iPhone and said, "Hey," and underneath it was one of the... It wasn't called a Bento box at the time. They did the slides in a different style. But at Steve Jobs original introduction, they had a bunch of things on a slide and they said Cocoa, that everything Apple had done for the original iPhone, before the iPhone, before the App Store, and before they announced, famously took them several months before they said, "Okay, we're going to do an SDK," but they said that they were using Cocoa. There's like a five-minute podcast Merlin Mann did at Macworld Expo talking to me and Jason Snell, the day of the keynote on the floor, it was like a five-minute interview with me and Snell by Merlin Mann. And Snell and I were like, "Apple didn't say much about this Cocoa thing, but presumably at some point, it's just probably not ready yet. They're going to open up APIs and this is going to be huge." I mean, this was hours after the keynote when we were still euphoric about the whole thing because everybody was sort of looking forward to just an iPod phone, right? David Barnard: Right. John Gruber: And it was so much more, it felt like my mind had gotten significantly bigger during the keynote. My brain had grown because the realm of possibility of personal computing was suddenly much larger than I thought. But in that initial moment, most developers were thinking was, "Well, that's fantastic if they're Xocoa APIs," and UIKits slightly different than AppKit, but every single AppKit going back to next developer I know looked at the initial UIKit APIs and was like, "Oh, all right, this is different, but I know this, this is very familiar." But the idea that developers had was how do you take ideas that are good Mac apps and put them on the phone? And for many apps, that was a great idea and Apple itself did that, right? Safari, mail, how do you take mail and make a version that fits on the phone? But the opportunity that I think Mac developers didn't think of right away is what sort of ideas only make sense for a phone, a little pocket, 3.5 inch screen device that's with you all the time. That wouldn't make sense on a Mac and a mileage tracker is exactly that sort of idea. That's what I remember hitting me about that app in 2008. Like, oh, this would be stupid on the Mac. What are you going to do? Take your MacBook or PowerBook? I forget what, I guess they were MacBook set by 2008, but what are you going to do? Take a laptop with you in your car everywhere and log your gas and mileage? No, but for something that would replace what you would've done in a pocket notebook, that's a perfect idea. Obviously, people want this. And that's where I feel like you were ahead of me and I'm like, "I got to follow this guy because he's thinking about things that are phone first." David Barnard: Right. Yeah. Well, enough navel-gazing. I'm blushing. But I appreciate all of that. And again, just the perfect person to have this kind of conversation with, which I've wanted to have this conversation for a while in service of the community of... In my day job at RevenueCat, and I do still build apps on the side, so I'm still an indie developer, I was looking at my LinkedIn the other day and 17 years at Contrast and still going strong, still running my weather app on the side and stuff. So at my day job at RevenueCat, I interface with a ton of developers and a lot of them don't care one lick about Apple, in fact, I mean, the growing hostility, people who've never built an app before will book an office hours call with me and say, "Screw Apple, screw them in their 30%." There's no care for Apple as a company or the products or anything like that. And so I wanted to do this podcast to give some of that history. I was actually thinking as I was preparing these notes, it's almost a book at some point, the history of the App Store and how it shaped the world. I mean, so many decisions that Apple made, big and small, literally did shape how things happen, and we'll get into some of that. But I wanted to step all the way back, and again, in doing the research for this over the weekend, I saw something that really surprised me, and I think I knew this, but I hadn't seen the numbers. And that is that the three top executives at Apple whose teams work on the app store. So I think maybe, and Apple is famously secretive about who does what and who reports to who and those kinds of things. But from my understanding... John Gruber: They're secretive about everything, David. David Barnard: Everything, yeah. Yeah. Something like 90% of the people who interface with developers in the App Store who work on the App Store report up to three executives. Greg Joswiak, who joined Apple in 1986. John Gruber: Yeah, I think right out of college. He went to University of Michigan and went right to Apple. David Barnard: Phil Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987, and Eddy Cue who joined Apple in 1989. And so to really understand Apple and how they interact with developers and how they receive the developer community, you really do have to go all the way back to the 1980s when these three key executives joined and started, and each of them have their different role in developer relations over time. But going back to that 1984 release of the Mac and these early days of developer relations between Apple and developers, I think is so fascinating, and one of the things, again, I didn't eve... I knew, but seeing it again in black and white, just how instrumental Microsoft was in those early days to Apple that two years ahead of the 1984 release of the Mac, Microsoft had agreed to build products for this new platform. And then specifically, and again, never heard this before, but Bill Gates was kind of an Apple fanboy in some of the early days before they got really contentious. And I read this history piece about the history of Apple that said Gates would show up to events, Macworld and other events with Macintosh shirts, he would wear a Macintosh. I mean, can you even imagine Bill Gates in the '80s wearing Macintosh T-shirt? It was just such a different era. But then over time, developer relations started to get a bit contentious. What do you remember? I mean, you were, gosh, like 6, 8, 10 at the time when all this happened. And I was five. But we both read a lot about the history. So what do you recall? And then what do you remember from having read upon all this. John Gruber: Too young to have experienced those years extemporaneously, but from what I've read, one of the key superpowers that Gates had, and I think it's true, I think this is not an original observation, but no matter how big, and no matter even... I mean, I guess eventually after, when you get closer to 50 years, which Apple and Microsoft are at, but maybe closer to a century after entire original generations have clearly all died off, it fades away. But all companies in all fields are just infused with the personalities of their founders. And one of the things that Gates infused in Microsoft was an amazing willingness or just natural ability. I don't even think it was something he did purposefully. I think it's just the way his mind worked is he was always thinking what could be and was not attached to the way things were. The whole name Microsoft, the whole idea that revolution of the company was, "Hey, we could make a company." This was him and Paul Allen that just focuses on software and had no plans in those early days to make their own computer. And all of the action in the late '70s at that moment of the PC revolution, the late '70s and the early '80s was on the company's making computers, Apple and Commodore and Texas Instruments, you name it, IBM, once they made the PC and Microsoft's key insight was, "Hey, software is incredibly valuable." And at the time, that idea alone was revolutionary. It was absolutely revolutionary because everybody else thought the only thing that matters is computers and computers were all absurdly expensive. Just look at the memory that was in those computers. The Commodore 64 was called the 64, not because it was 64 bit, but because it had 64 kilobytes of RAM, right? That was the 64, and it wasn't cheap, cheap. And the idea was software, you just copy, it was just ones and zeros. You could just make copies. And the idea that no, no software is worth paying for was a revolution. And I think that's why Gates could have such incredible enthusiasm for something like some other company's computer because everything they did was for somebody else's computer. They didn't make computers and they didn't really have a platform. And so I think Gates recognized early that Apple made better computers and that they were onto something. And he clearly, from the outset, had the mindset of the complete opposite of, I forget his name, but the 1960s era, IBM CEO who said, "I think there's a market in the world for six or seven computers." Because the thinking in that era was, well, the US military will want one, maybe like the US IRS, and there'll be one great supercomputer for universities to share. Whereas Gates was really thinking early on, "Oh no, there should be computers in every house." But he wasn't thinking that Microsoft would own a platform. But then when the opportunity came with DOS and they saw the opportunity they had by owning MS-DOS and being the company that provided it, it changed their thinking completely to instead of, oh, we'll make software for anybody's computer. We're going to make a platform and we'll still make some software for other platforms, but we really want to steer everybody to our platform even though we don't make the computers. David Barnard: One of the interesting footnotes in this as well is that Apple had a similar idea of we're building this platform, we need to make sure there's software on it. And so they built Mac, right? MacPaint, MacDraw, and a bunch of other apps. And again, something I didn't realize until doing all this research was that in 1986, they stopped bundling those because it was competitive with third-party developers. And man, I mean, these days with sherlocking and Apple building an app for everything, I mean, even most recently building an invite app like building a sports app, Apple has over the last 17 years of the App Store gone deeper and deeper and further and further into competing directly with third-party developers. But back here in the '80s, they were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't want to squash the potential for third-party developers to build for this platform that we have. So these apps that we built for our own platform that we have previously bundled," I mean, again, at some point maybe when Schiller or Jos or one of these guys retires, we'll do this again and get the inside scoop on some of the deeper thinking behind this. But they stopped bundling, and then in 1987, they spun all those apps off into Claris, a subsidiary of Apple to have them at little bit more of an arm's length. It's specifically to not interfere with third-party developers. And it's still fascinating to go all the way back to the '80s and see such a different Apple that they recognized the power of developers in the platform and were actively doing things at that time to make sure they didn't compete. They didn't make it a non-starter for people to build these kind of apps for the Macintosh platform, which is just fascinating. John Gruber: And it was about a decade, I would say maybe '86, '87, and those are the years where I was there as a teenager into college, and '86 to '95, '96 or so was the decade where Apple was very hands-off about first-party apps and it made sense. And one of the areas of contention, it's sort of like a heartbreak, and I forget the exact details. I know Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful, wonderful... I think there's a story about it on Folklore.org, but you can look it up. But there were two basics, the basic programming language for the Mac in the very early '80s and Apple Basic was much better and could let you do Macintosh-like things like pop open a dialog box, which you think like, well, of course, why would you want to have a programming environment for the Mac that couldn't pop open a dialog box? But that was revolutionary at the time, and Microsoft had their basic, and as like a, let's keep Microsoft happy, Apple sort of squashed their own in-house basic, which was a much better programming environment for the Macintosh. So as not to step on the toes of Microsoft Basic, which was more of a oh, character based sort of text interface basic, where you could write the same Microsoft Basic program and run it on the Mac and run it on any other computer that had Microsoft Basic. And that's just one example of that sort of thinking and this sort of thing that led them to spin off the initial, which they had to do again because nobody knew how to write these graphical user interface programs. It often comes up and people, you have to Google the images to believe it, but the original Macintosh keyboard didn't have arrow keys because they wanted to force developers and users to use the mouse as opposed to almost all other computers at the time didn't even have mice. So there was the Macintosh, which had a mouse and other computers which had no pointer interface, just a keyboard interface. So you'd be like, "What do you want to do in the computer?" And it would present a text menu and you'd use arrow keys to go up and down. I want to open existing file down. I want to create a new file down. I want to manage my files up, down, left, right. So to force developers to make programs that were mouse driven, mouse pointer driven. Apple didn't even put arrow keys on the original Macintosh keyboard, which imagine the frustration editing text now. So if you wanted to, you could backspace, there was a delete key, but if you wanted to go back a word or two, you had to go take your hands off the keyboard, go to the mouse and click where you wanted to go. But I understand why that didn't last, but I also understand the thinking at the time to break people's habits because as much as they thought this is a computer for the rest of us, which was their slogan, and this will be the way that most people in the future learn to use computers. Right now, the market is people who already know how to use computers, but what they know from the existing computers isn't the way this computer works. And so they had to make apps like MacWrite and MacPaint and MacDraw, and then two years in, they're like, "Ah, we're kind of squashing the market. What we really need is a thriving third party market, so let's go hands off." And then for the next decade, the Mac really didn't have many first party programs. If you just went to the store and bought a brand new Macintosh in 1991 or '92, you got TextEdit or it was called SimpleText at the time. There were very few apps that were built in. There was no built-in Contacts app. You didn't have all these things that you would think, "Oh, how do you have a computer without an address book?" Well, the idea was that whole thing was a third party opportunity. David Barnard: And this is a great example of why I wanted to have this conversation, and maybe we'll pull on some of these threads as we go through. One thing to understand about Apple and how they operate today is that they've had success in doing those sorts of things. And so when you look at Apple TV that famously launched, and Apple tried to get people to develop games for it, but you could only use the Apple remote, and it was Apple as with the keyboard not having arrow keys, it was, we don't want people to require a gaming controller to build games, so we're going to force them to use remote. And games sucked, and I was so pissed at Apple, it took them, what, three or four years to finally enable controller support. And by that time, it was just so clear that Apple TV was not going to be a gaming platform, maybe could have been more of a gaming platform had they done it, maybe it was the right choice, whatever. And then look at the Vision Pro. Two years ago, I was so frustrated that Apple didn't release motion track controllers like what you have on the Meta Quest, but why did they do that? It goes all the way back to 1984 and not having the arrow keys, it was, "Hey, we're introducing a new user interface paradigm, a new user experience, and we want to force developers to build apps that use hand gestures and eye tracking and not controllers." Now, two years later, they just announced at WABC that PlayStation VR controller support in Vision Pro, but this is two years after the fact, and I was so frustrated two years ago. But this is one of those things when you look back, you better understand why they make the decisions they make. They have a long history of making those kinds of decisions going all the way back to the '80s and forcing developers into the path that they think is best for the platform is just so fascinating. John Gruber: I keep repeating it. I'm more bullish on visionOS as a platform than most commentators, and I keep drawing the analogy to the original Macintosh, the original Macintosh in 1984, I know the number off the top of my head because I bring it up all the time. It was $2,500, which inflation adjusted is give or take right now, like $7,200. There was only one config. There was no option to get more RAM. There was no storage, you used floppy drives. So $2,500, it was 7,200 equivalent today about twice the cost of a Vision Pro, very expensive. It's sold so poorly and so under their expectations that it was the impetus for driving jobs out of the company. And in the whole, people don't know the history, like how in the world did Apple kick Steve Jobs out of the company? The real reasons were mostly personality conflicts, and that yes, of course, he did not work well when there was somebody else, John Sculley from Pepsi as the CEO who Jobs, the founder, ostensibly reported to, of course, Jobs did not work well as anything but the CEO, and that's ultimately the reason. But in terms of going to the board and having reasons other than this guy's a pain in my ass, to force him out, the sales of the Mac were the... And again, it was expensive and Apple couldn't really afford the fact that it was a bit of a flop in 1984, 1985, but the PC press of the time took it as, "Hey, this whole graphical user interface thing, it's clever, but it's a gimmick. This isn't how real computer users want to use a computer. Nobody wants to take their hands off the keyboard and use a mouse all the time. It's a waste of memory to be drawing all these windows and stuff like this." That was all proven wrong. The Mac was the right idea for the future of personal computing, but it needed at least four or five years before you're like, "Holy, shit, this is like a thriving platform that's revolutionizing certain industries like desktop publishing." David Barnard: Yeah. And as a 40, almost 50-year-old company, I guess next year it's 50 years, somewhere around there. Apple's patience is remarkable. This is another thing that I continually get wrong, and I think a lot of people get wrong. 100% agree on the Vision Pro. It is a phenomenal piece of hardware. It is an incredible platform for experimenting with the future, even if it's flawed and even if there are problems. But Apple's patient, and clearly they have AR stuff in the labs that Cook and others have played with. There's been reporting recently about all Tim Cook thinks about is getting to this AR glasses future or whatever it might be. And the Vision Pro is that first step along the way, and Apple is very patient, as much as people pan it as few units as they sold, even if it's been less successful as they internally hope for, they are nothing if not a patient company that's going to keep plugging away at these things. Because look how it turned out for the Mac, like you said, it took four or five years. Well, I mean, we're two years into the Vision Pro. They've got time and they've got cash to wait around and they've got the experience of building these platforms over decades, not making sure something is a hit in months and days. John Gruber: This is only based on observation, but I think I almost see how can somebody refute this is that their thinking is basically if their projection of where a hit AR/VR, let's just put aside whether the first hit product in the category will be AR or VR, but it'll probably be AR, right? VR is just too weird where my definition of the difference, the broad difference here is if the device is off, powered off, can you see anything or do you see through glasses, right? If it's glasses that when the device is at 0% battery powered off, you still see through the lenses, that's AR. And if it's like Vision Pro where it's off, it's like blindfolds, that's VR, it's probably AR, but let's just say it doesn't matter. Put that aside, that it'll take till around 2030 to have a product at a price and a feature set and a battery life that's compelling to explode in popularity and that people will be like, "I got to get one of those." If it's 2030, when that's going to come out, what's the right way to approach the market? And I think the people who are laughing at Vision Pro and saying, "It's $3,500, nobody's bought one. They've only sold hundreds of thousands, not even a million, whatever." Apple should have waited until then to release a product, and then boom, here's the first thing. And the iPhone was sort of like that, right? And the iPhone was right out of the gate. Yes, it was a little more expensive, but the first iPhone was incredibly useful, totally credible device. And I know it didn't sell in great quantities compared to today's numbers, but as somebody who bought one, it was like, "Yeah, this is real." And it's not like I'm buying a product that hints at a future. The Vision Pro is not like that. The Vision Pro is not the iPhone in 2007. The Vision Pro today, I don't like calling it a dev kit, but it's like an enthusiast kit, which includes developers, but it's an enthusiast kit that you spend a ridiculous amount of money compared to a MacBook Air. You get a really good MacBook Air for $1,000, or you could get a really good MacBook Air for 1,300, $1,400. This is three times, four times more expensive and it's less essential to people's lives than their iPhone, which you can get a really good iPhone for seven, $800. It's different than that, but is the right strategy to wait until that hardware is out in 2030 and then start there with building a platform or is the right strategy to start building a platform around 2023, 2024, and when that hardware is finally available and there's a breakthrough in the technology and the price and the capabilities in the battery life that you've got five years of ecosystem and content behind it. All these complaints, again, I've complained too and I'm a little surprised, but they're getting there, just in terms of having entertaining immersive content, the things like the Bono video and the adventure climbing mountains and all this stuff. They've got some stuff, you would think with their budget that they could have more, but the idea of, hey, if they're going to sell this thing for all this money, shouldn't they have more content available? Well, if 2030 is when they think this is going to explode, think of how much content they're going to have in the library by then. And I think that's what they know. There are so many similarities between this and the Macintosh in 1984, but there are also so many profound differences because Apple is so big and so pervasive in popular culture and people's lives. And it breeds a different sentiment towards the company, which I think we're going to continue talking about with developer relations. But then on the other hand, their profound, almost unfathomable financial success gives them the liberty of saying, "We're going to make a seven-year bet that costs a lot of money," just in terms of this thousand or so software engineers who work on Vision stuff inside the company. We're going to make a profound bet to build this out over half a decade so that when the hardware's really there for a mass-market thing, we've got it. We've already got the platform, we've already got the UI paradigms nailed down, we've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be... John Gruber: ... nailed down. We've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be there five years ahead of time. It's a very different way of thinking than a company that is sweating it out. Are we still going to be in business two quarters from now? David Barnard: Yeah, and I think that's part of the pushback is that too many people, especially in the press, continue to expect every product Apple releases to be the next iPhone. And the iPhone is just singular in history as a consumer electronic device that it was able to come out of the gate as such an incredible useful day one thing. Because even, and again, I mean, this is why we're having this conversation. You go back to 1984, the $2,500, which is $7,200 a day or whatever it is, was not a daily driver, this is changing my life, most productive thing in the world. It was a nice to have, it was an enthusiast, it was something to tinker with and maybe you find a few productivity things here and there that it benefits. Apple has done this decade after decade after decade, and they have that long vision. And again, going back to these execs who've been around through it all, it's like they've seen it happen and they know it will happen and they know it can happen. And to your point, they're not under that pressure of the Vision Pro has to be the iPhone. It doesn't have to be the iPhone. We've done this 10 times before with different products with transitioning from Power PC to Intel, with early days of iMac and it becoming a consumer hit that wasn't even the massive smash hit compared to the iPhone. And so it's like they know how to build platforms over decades and not over months and years that everybody else expects it to happen. John Gruber: So the one difference, and it is almost the same thing but along a different vector where I said about Gates and the way that Gates instilled in Microsoft a sort of flexibility in thinking like, hey, what's the opportunities right now? I think Satya Nadella's era as CEO embodies that where I feel like he came in and was like, you know what? We don't have to be all about Windows, Windows, Windows. We can go to more of a cloud first mindset and look at where they are financially and in cloud services and stuff. It's been a great deal for them, but that they got their institutional fortitude is once we have a hit, we will latch onto it and try to stick with it and ride it all the way down. And that was the whole mindset with Windows. Windows everywhere and they're going to put Windows on your TV set-top box and Windows phone, right? And they were trying to make smartphones years before the iPhone and literally they had a start menu in the lower left corner. It looked like Windows 95 but on a phone and it wasn't running Windows apps, but it was a mindset of bringing Windows mentality. Whereas Apple's mindset led by Steve Jobs was let's start from scratch. And as much as they wound up using the Cocoa APIs and made UI kit, it was only not because that was a starting point. It was like, okay, if we're going to do this, maybe we could fit a small version of the Mac kernel onto this device and we'll build it, but we're not going to have any compatibility. It's not going to be called the Mac phone. We're not going to have an Apple menu up in the upper left corner. We're going to rethink this whole thing from scratch. Apple has this sort of, if it's a new form factor, we're going to start with a new platform and that's a very different thinking, but at another level, just in terms of its capabilities, the reason the iPhone could debut in 2007 as a totally credible, you could buy one right now, the first one totally useful is that it's ultimately, and this is the unifying theme of the last five years of dithering with me and Ben Thompson, is that the biggest marketing shame of the entire industry is that we wasted the term personal computer on desktop and laptop computers in 1980 because the phone is ultimately the personal computer. And that's where everything was heading from the Apple One in 1977 until 2007. Everything was heading towards building something under $1,000 that fit in your pocket and had an interface that anybody could just use and that the input was just poking at it with your finger and it was all visual and it had wireless connection to a network that connected to the entire world. It was so science fiction from the perspective of 1978, 79, but within 30 years, that's where everything in those 30 years was heading. So when it launched, it was really the culmination of what we've called personal computers for 30 years, whereas Vision Pro is sort of like, let's do something all new and we have to sort of start from scratch. It's going to be way too expensive and heavy and limited and the battery's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's a totally new vector. David Barnard: Yeah, well, we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves. I want to go all the way back to the eighties again. It's important to step through the history of these developer relations of what brought us even to the iPhone. So I'll speed through this. You and I could talk for five hours, but I don't think we should turn this into a five-hour podcast, so I'll speed through a little bit of this. But going all the way back to the eighties, PageMaker was a huge turning point. Third party app, some people have credited it as saving the Mac platform. That it was so important to digital publishing and this is where as a platform apps can revolutionize your platform. When you've built a and hardware and third party developers go nuts on it, they build new things and do things that you would've never done as a first party software closed ecosystem, it's only Apple and the Mac and we're the only ones building for it. You get this entire ecosystem of people building new things and PageMaker was one of those things that became so integral to the digital publishing world that it's credited as a third party app for saving the whole Apple Mac platform and then you get Illustrator for Mac in 87, you get Photoshop in 1990 and during this time I think Apple really recognizes that power of developers. Guy Kawasaki joined around that time. I forget exactly, I think he may have joined before the 1984 Mac, but he was the first software evangelist and developer evangelist. Again, in doing research for this and reading up on some of the history of this, I realized just how much a debt of gratitude in some ways I owe to Guy Kawasaki for me having a job today at Revenue is that he... This whole developer advocacy and people who aren't technical or... I mean, I'm mildly technical but really can promote these platforms. It goes all the way back to the eighties and Guy Kawasaki and Apple being so enthusiastic for third party developers. John Gruber: I know Guy a little, I feel like I should know him better. I feel like he sort of left this racket right around the time that I was becoming more prominent in this industry, but I've met him a few times, but I've read his books and the Macintosh Way, it's a great book if you can find a copy of it. When I joined Barebone Software, I worked at Bare Bones, the BB edit company from 2000 to 2002. It was the only mandatory reading before. It was like the entire employee onboarding process was you have to read Guy Kawasaki's the Macintosh Way, but arguably it was the Apple way and at the time though, because it was the only successful platform Apple had, the Macintosh and Apple were easily conflated, but I think that what Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the intersection of developers, users, and the platform maker and that combined the three could form a cohesive whole that everything... And formed a flywheel where it just kept benefiting everybody where users are happy and they're buying the devices, which helps the platform maker and that the more devices the platform maker makes, the bigger the market is for third party developers. And so third party developers make more and invest more in the platform and make more innovative software that makes users like, oh my God, look what PageMaker can do. Holy crap. And then the users buy more of the... And it just keeps going and going. David Barnard: Sounds a lot like the iPhone. John Gruber: Yeah, I think that the other thing that Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the idea that you could be an important serious player professionally in this field without being a programmer or a designer even. You could be a professional user. I'm a writer and I have a computer science degree from college from long ago, so more technical than most users, but I get that mindset where kind of what I wanted to be was a professional user, by being an enthusiast and learning how everything works. And that was his evangelism. It wasn't evangelism in the sense of evangelizing a religion based on faith. It was more like a religion based on practical advantages, like hey, learn how to do these things, learn how the actual system works and you're going to have superpowers compared to people who do the same thing as you who don't understand how these computers work. One person can do the work of 10 people with a Macintosh, and it was true. David Barnard: I saw that guy has been doing the rounds on podcasts. You should definitely have them on your podcast at some point. That'd be one I would love to listen to, you and Guy talking through this for two hours. We're kind of breezing over it in five minutes here, but I think it would be a fascinating listen for you and Guy to kind of talk through that in more detail. But we did want to keep moving. So that was the kind of eighties and into the early nineties. But then what happened in the nineties I think is kind of pivotal to Apple's relationship with developers is that in the nineties, and you know this better than I, so you can fill in the details here, but hardware sales started to tank. Things started to get really rocky for Apple and they got to this point where third-party developers had so much power over Apple that if Adobe wasn't updating their apps on the Mac platform and simultaneously the Windows platform had taken off at that point where they were probably, I assume making way more money on the Windows platform. It was kind of the platform to be on during that time, but Apple desperately needed those third-party developers to continue building for the platform to keep the platform sustainable. And that all kind of culminated in 1997 with the famous Steve Jobs standing in an auditorium with a giant screen of Bill Gates behind him and Microsoft saving Apple. And again, people who haven't studied the history or been around or not old men like you and I couldn't even fathom that Microsoft saved Apple. Had Microsoft not done that, Apple would've gone bankrupt. So fill in some of the gaps there. What happened in the nineties and how did Apple get into this desperate point where third-party developers had so much power over them needing Microsoft to save the company. John Gruber: I think point one that gets overlooked a lot in the years where Jobs was exiled from Apple, who knows what would've happened. Maybe that was for the best that he went and founded... It worked out well for him to go found Next, struggle to make next a thing and then have Next in Apple. I always call it a reunification rather than an acquisition because it really is so obvious. I mean, Craig Federighi's first job out of college was at Next and it's like he left for a while, right? Scott Forstall, but where Apple got lost in those years, one of the ways, and I think I haven't seen a lot of people or a lot of books focus on it, was the sort of mindset in the early PC years, a company would come out with a new computer and the computer was the platform effectively, and there wasn't really this idea, there wasn't so much of you'd make the Commodore 64 and then when Commodore came out with the Commodore 128, I forget if you could run Commodore 64 programs, but it was sort of a new computer. It was like, ah, this is a different computer. And then Commodore came out with Amiga is sort of an overlooked thing in history and I know the panic guys were big Amiga fans and the Amiga had the video toaster was doing digital video editing way before any other computer platform. It had some amazing capabilities, but Commodore just exemplifies it. Commodore 64 was a hit, then the 128 not so much of a hit, then the Amiga, which was way more capable. But that every couple of years the idea was there'd be like a new thing and backwards compatibility was like a maybe and it would be like a mode, but basically you'd sort of come out with an all new thing every couple years as opposed to evolving a platform over decades. It just didn't enter Apple's mind. And so Apple had all of these failed next generation, what's going to come after the Macintosh things in the late eighties and especially the early nineties, Pink and Taligent, and it's all confusing and it would take forever to explain as opposed to what was an operating system and what was a company and what was a cross-platform like? Taligent was sort of a cross company thing with IBM where it was in addition to an operating system, they'd make a new platform and the power PC chip architecture sort of came out of that. And so it wasn't totally futile, but the idea wasn't to how do we keep evolving the Macintosh? It was what comes after the Macintosh. That's the fundamental flaw. And the Newton is laughed at in some ways and other ways people are like, oh man, they're sort of a decade ahead of in terms of you'd have a handheld thing in your hand with a touchscreen, but the most obvious problem with the Newton was that something handheld that needs ubiquitous wireless networking. And there wasn't even Wi-Fi at the time, let alone cellular. Palm Pilot was sort of more of a hit, but mostly because it was affordable. And people like me, I had one, I had a handspring visor and I liked it. In hindsight, there's a lot of younger people who probably vaguely have heard of Palm Pilots, but it wasn't that big a deal. At the time, people are like, oh, the Palm Pilot is what Apple should have made with the Newton. No, because even the Palm Pilot really wasn't that big of a hit and it didn't have any staying power because it didn't do networking, it didn't have a connection to the internet, even Wi-Fi, let alone cellular. That's really what a handheld needed. But the other thing about the Newton that was just as important to its failure was it really hardly related to the Macintosh at all. There was a Newton, I forget what it's called, Newton Sink Utility or something, and you connect a serial cable to your Mac and Newton, you could sync some things, but like I said earlier, there was no contact app on the Mac from Apple. So where did your Newton contacts go? The Newton had a contacts app because it was a personal digital assistant and they had all of these things about what comes after the Macintosh when what they should have clearly been thinking of is how do we move the Macintosh forward? And meanwhile, while Apple's core interest and at the top level of the company was interested on these big expensive, all-failed next generation, what comes after the Macintosh? There were people at Apple who were grinding away on the Macintosh, putting out system seven and then system 7.1, system 7.5 and sort of keeping the company alive financially because that's an actual platform that people were using and buying. And I think at the highest level, Apple was looking at that the way that the Macintosh part of the company was looking at the Apple II in the eighties. And for most of those mid to late eighties, Apple was staying alive financially through Apple II sales, not Macintosh sales. And they were thinking, that's what the Macintosh is doing now and we will get pink or Copeland or whatever this thing is. Copeland was a next generation Mac. That was where they started to get it through their head that, oh, what we really need to do is keep the Mac alive and come up with something. They just wasted half a decade of great still explosive new stuff coming out. The whole internet thing happened in the midst of that where there was no internet to speak of. I mean, the internet existed, but it was like a university type thing in 1991 and by 1993, 4, 5, it was like, oh, Netscape is a huge thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft was doing the opposite with Windows where they're like Windows One, nobody used, nobody even heard of Windows Two, nobody used, nobody heard of. Windows Three, now people are using it instead of DOS, but it was really clunky and awful and they're like, let's make a better one. Let's make one that steals interface ideas from Next where the buttons and stuff look 3D and have gray scale. And they were grinding away on making the thing that was sort of a hit just a little better every couple years. And Apple just lost half a decade in that period. And thankfully they had people who were incrementally making the Macintosh better, but then they'd sort of painted themselves in a corner where the Macintosh operating system, not to get too super nerdy, but was still fundamentally based on some assumptions from the mid-eighties about how low level all software worked and the idea of preemptive multitasking where a program crashing couldn't possibly crash the whole computer because it would just be the program. Whereas the Macintosh was so low level and all programs sort of made some low level assumptions where they were, there was no kernel to speak of in computer science terms in that classic macOS. And they were doing things with low level memory where like, hey, if Internet Explorer froze up, your whole computer might just freeze. And then you had to literally use the power button on the hardware to restart it and anything you had open that wasn't saved was gone. In 1984, 85, 86, that's the way a computer like the Macintosh had to work. There was no option to do preemptive multitasking and have memory safe applications in that era because of the constraints of the hardware. But by 1995, 96, that was totally possible and it was obviously the way it should be, but there was no simple way to just say that's how the next version of macOS is going to work. And all of the existing apps like Photoshop and Excel and Microsoft Word will just work. There was no way. It was too incompatible. And that's what you were talking about earlier where Apple was up against it because the only reason the Macintosh was thriving was because of these apps from companies... And the big ones were Adobe and Microsoft, and if their existing apps didn't continue to work, there was no way anybody was going to upgrade to whatever they came up with no matter what its technical capabilities. David Barnard: And so then being back against the wall and Jobs having gone off to Next and built that next iteration, the Next revolution in computing the foundation for everything we do today was what Jobs built at Next, they acquired Next in 96 and Jobs comes back and then that's what leads up to this Microsoft committing to the platform, investing money into Apple. And then I wanted to read a quote, and this is going to be long, and those of you who really care can go back and watch. There's a video of this is that at WWDC in 1997. There's a quote from Jobs. A developer asked about OpenDoc, so I [inaudible 00:55:54] all this, but we can skip over the details of it because I think the details are less important, but Apple decided to kill this technology, OpenDoc and the developer very frustrated, goes up to the mic at WWDC during an open mic session with Steve Jobs at WWDC in 97. Very frustrated, why are you killing this thing? We've invested a lot of money into it and I want to read the quote. I kind of jump around in the quote because it would take 10 minutes to read, but let me read this quote from Steve Jobs because I think it's just so fascinating. "I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of, I apologize, I feel your pain." I wanted to get that in there because can you imagine Apple in 2025 saying, I apologize, I feel your pain and just the rest of this is so good. John Gruber: I can imagine it, but it would be very surprising and I feel like that's exactly what they could use, but yes. David Barnard: Yeah, that's what we're going to get to and that's why I wanted these quotes. We'll come back to it maybe an hour from now when we get deeper into the iPhone stuff. So continuing, it's skipping around the quote, but "focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no and you've got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you off people. So you take your lumps and Apple has been taking their share of lumps for the past six months in a very unfair way, and it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that." Man, Steve Jobs off the cuff. I miss that. I miss that so much. "And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." So again, that's missing a lot of context. It's missing a lot of the actual quote. You can go back and watch the video. I'll put it in the show notes, but I just thought that was so fascinating that Apple in '97 was at this point that Steve Jobs of all people was there on stage answering this kind of question with a level of kind of humility and self-awareness that, "Hey, developers are so important. I feel your pain. I'm sorry, I apologize. But then also clearly talking to the future of like, hey, this is going to be hard, but we're building towards something." And they included that quote specifically from what you were alluding to is that in this forty-year history with developers, there have been moments like that where you see a more open Apple, a more contrite Apple, and that the success of the iPhone has really changed the way I feel like Apple does relate to developers and Apple has not had to take its lumps in a good 20 or 30 years and has not had that level of forthrightness and humility with developers when things do go sideways, and this is where I think Ben Thompson has said multiple times on different podcasts and articles he's written, I think some people inside Apple view this and maybe those three top execs who've been there this whole time and a lot of people inside Apple, it felt humiliating, not humble. And that this was a period in their history that they were so beholden to third-party developers and they never wanted to be in that position again. They never wanted to have to take lumps again. They never wanted to be on that verge of bankruptcy. They never wanted to feel that pain and be humiliated like that again versus I go back and I read this, I'm like, wow, what a great example of just how much goodwill do you instill in developers in the entire ecosystem by speaking like that to developers? John Gruber: The first thing I'll say to that is that of those three executives you've mentioned, Eddie Kew, Jaws, and Schiller. Schiller's the exception where Schiller, I know you probably know this, actually hasn't been in Apple continuously since 1987 or whatever, and in the early nineties he was, I forget where else, but he ended up at Macromedia, which was the company behind PageMaker, or maybe not... No, I forget, but they had... They were the competitor to Adobe, and so Schiller has been on the other side of that divide making the essential tools for the Mac. That just helps add to that same perspective though of knowing how much leverage those companies had over Apple. And the two things that were scarring to Apple were the near bankruptcy. And so it's made the company institutionally incredibly frugal and more so while Jaws was still alive, it was only after Jaws died and Cook took over that they started doing things like shareholder buybacks and stuff while Jaws was alive. They were just hoarding their profits. They just were putting it into that Braeburn Capital subsidiary and just sitting on an ever-growing mountain of cash because in the same way that my grandparents who had been through the Great Depression would eat, scrape every single bit of food off their plate and thought it was offensive, no matter whether you thought it tasted good or whether you were still hungry, it was offensive not to eat every bit of food offered to you because they remembered not having enough food and the parts of the company that remembered being on the verge of bankruptcy, in some ways it helps focus the company, but in some ways in the long run sort of hurt them. And I think having somebody new like Tim Cook, again, he's been there a long time, but he wasn't there for the near bankruptcy part or came in just after, and so he wasn't as scarred by it. But I think that developer relations part definitely has, now that Apple has gotten big, has hurt them. That they're still so thinking of themselves as underdogs who want to assert not dominance over developers from their perspective, but having at least 51% of the power over developers that they've lost the fact that they've actually got 95% of the power or however you want to assign the power dynamic in the current state. They're so hell-bent on making sure they never fall below 51% of the power between the platform and the developers that they've just lost sight of how overwhelmingly they've already won and how much it would be in their interest to make concessions because of the surplus of power that they have to bolster developer goodwill. I don't think we're putting them on a hypothetical psychiatrist couch, but they do remember it. It's infused their thinking about the company. David Barnard: And we will put a pin in that to come back to as we talk about the more modern era of lawsuits and regulation and everything else like that, but stepping back and walking through the history, you do see a different apple after that. And so Apple does go on to build keynote and pages and numbers and the whole digital hub and they start building more and more of those key pieces of software. I think in part from that scarred time of we want to make sure there's great software for the average user and we're going to bundle it even though that's in conflict with our third party developers. We're going to give things away free or cheap, and you see a different Apple in that early 2000 era of like, we're going to control our destiny. Third party developers are important. We're going to be a platform. We're going to encourage them, but we're going to cover our own bases. We're going to make sure that we're not beholden to these companies in the long run by doing these things. And then kind of the next era as I was going through all of this, and this is where I kind of step into it, is what I was calling the Delicious Era. And there were these at the time, going all the way back to the eighties, kind of smaller passionate developers, but I feel like the heyday of this passionate small developer time was those early 2000s. You had Delicious Monster Building, Delicious Library and Panic and the Omni Group and Rogue Amoeba, and you could probably... Bare Bones, you could probably list another 20 off the top of your head, and there was this kind of renaissance. The iPod started driving more and more people from Windows to the Mac. There were these really passionate kind of fanboy developers building these really cool software for the platform. And as a platform, I feel like there was a bit of a heyday during that time where Apple was kind of... And Sherlocking famously came out of the Watson Sherlock thing in, I think, that was 2020, but there was this kind of heyday leading up to the iPhone of really great independent software creators while at the same time Microsoft and Adobe and others were starting to invest more back into the platform and the Mac becomes this really solid platform in that era. John Gruber: It's a tough thing to strike a balance on. It's almost impossible to just get perfectly right where it's clearly correct for there to be a suite of fundamental apps out of the box in a factory fresh new computer or phone or tablet. And that therefore that 1990 to 1995 Apple mindset of we're hardly going to ship any first party apps and everything will be third party apps because we don't want to step on their toes. And even if we have a subsidiary that makes Mac Write and Mac Draw and stuff like that, or File Maker, we're going to put it in a subsidiary and try to treat it as best we can as an actual third party developer, even though we own the company. That's not the right way to deal with a platform, but obviously Sherlocking every successful app is also not the right mindset. It's a hard balance to strike, and I think they've managed it pretty well, especially... And again, in the early 2000s when Sherlocking first became a term, it was so few years since the era when Apple studiously avoided ever stepping on the toes of third party developers, that it felt like all of this was newly offensive. And here in 2025, that's sort of ancient history. And so people don't think of it that way. So for example, just this month at WWDC, they announced clipboard history management in Sherlock on macOS Tahoe and a sort of more launch bar, Alfred Ray cast style superpowers in Spotlight where you can assign a two letter abbreviation to something to launch a shortcut or something like that. I think that they continue to strike the right balance where I, as a long time launch bar user, I'm glad they're adding those features to Spotlight, but there's 0% chance that I'm switching to Spotlight. I have an example though where here's a market where I feel like they tried to stay away from third parties and I think it bit them and now they're entering late, which is password management. And OnePassword is a great app from a great company that used to make a really great Mac app for passwords, and they're still a good company and the app is still fine. I've never been a user of it, but I see why people are. But the dynamic is the more popular and successful OnePassword came, the more that grew and they grew in interest to want to reach the enterprise market. And that changed the product in a way that made it not so great as a Apple product, an Apple platform product. OnePassword is still a great product, super good at a technical level, super useful in that enterprise context and in terms of some of the family sharing and stuff like that. But it's like if you really want the Mac style interface for password integration and the iPhone style integration and the syncing between the two, it started becoming not as great as it used to be because their interest in growing their market, which is great for the company, were in conflict with making it perfect for the Apple platforms. And so Apple came out with Apple passwords I think last year. I think it's only been a year, maybe it's two years. David Barnard: I don't know. It's been... Well, I mean, the password app, but they've been kind slow rolling into building the password app. John Gruber: It was effectively an app worth more than an app, a serious app worth of capabilities and features, but hidden away in a system settings panel for years, I think out of deference to we don't want to squash this market. But then I think as the market sort of moved into a less and less idiomatic Apple platform style of software, they were like, you know what? We should just make our own app because we could do this in a way that's very Apple-y. And I think now the new passwords app, it's a good introduction to how do you make a modern app for Apple platforms? Any area where they try to stay out of, eventually they find themselves having to enter. David Barnard: Yeah, so this is a huge can of worms that we could spend an hour talking about the balance of Apple, what they ship and what they don't, and what developers' toes they step on and what they don't. Maybe this is a whole nother podcast, but I want to step back and- David Barnard: Maybe this is a whole another podcast. I wanted to step back and see if there was anything else you wanted to share relating to the 2000s in that. I feel like that era did actually set Apple up really well for the iPhone as a platform. The Cocoa frameworks, the passionate developer base, the books that were written. When I started working on iOS, I intended to be the programmer and do it all myself. And so I bought the famous book of the era, Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa frameworks or whatever it was. And so by the time you got to the iPhone, there was this really solid, passionate community. Books being written, conferences being attended. WWDC had grown tremendously, and this era of the 2000s of the Mac becoming this really great platform was a springboard that then propelled the iPhone even faster as a platform than I think it would've otherwise been. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that era before we jump into the iPhone era? John Gruber: The basic mindset in the late '90s in the industry was a sort of consensus that user interface design doesn't matter that much. Nobody would argue it doesn't matter at all, but that Apple's focus on making it the top priority of their platforms wasn't worth it because, okay, let's just concede that the Mac was a better user interface than Windows. Look at their market share. Obviously it didn't matter. It wasn't an unreasonable conclusion, but I think it was wrong-headed because I think that the problem that people arguing that way didn't see yet was that no computer. Again, it comes back to that argument that the iPhone is truly the first real personal computer, the one that every person would want and would care about. At the time, even in the late '90s, too many people making decisions about what computers to buy or what computers a company should buy weren't the people who care that much about user interface and therefore they were buying Windows PCs based on other criteria. Those early 2000s that built up this skill set in designers and developers and built up these teams of either companies or independents or just hobbyists, but at every level who could make software that was like, oh man, just look at it. Remember the Disco app. It was a DVD burning utility. When it burned the DVD, it actually had smoke come out of the window. Some people were like, well, that's just a complete waste of CPU and GPU resources, and other people were like, where do I buy this? I want to buy this because when I burn a CD or DVD, I want smoke to come out of the window because that's just cool and fun. This whole skill set was there for Apple and in 2008 when the app store opened up to build apps that people would just be like, but just look at it. Just look at this. Oh yeah, where do I get that app? I want to get it. It fueled this consumer fervor for the platform that no other platform could even hope to compete with at the time. There was no other platform. Early Android, they just couldn't do it. Microsoft's mobile, Blackberry, whatever. Nobody had the skill set. It was impossible to make anything that was like, just look at it. Just look at this app. Look how cool it looks. David Barnard: Yeah. I hadn't thought about it from that. The design perspective as well. I mean, that's what brought me to iPhone development. We'll move into the iPhone era now, is that I was that uber passionate Apple fanboy, Mac nerd. I had my, I don't even know what it was at the time, in 2007, some PowerBook that I had at the time. I loved the software, I loved the platform. I was first person, not first person in line. Well, I was first person in line to buy an iPhone. I was in line. Again, if you weren't around and weren't a fanboy at the time, it's laughable to think about this at the time, but I stood in line for, I think it was my iOS, Mac OS Tiger or one of those. There would be lines at the Apple Store and OS Update was a launch event. John Gruber: You had to pay $129 for it. David Barnard: Yes. You would line up to pay $120 to upgrade your operating system. It was that passion about the platform at that time that you had people like me and millions of us around the country who cared so deeply about the platform for all of these reasons is that it wasn't just good hardware, it wasn't just the OS, but it was this combination of OS and fun software and delightful, but it was productive. In 2003, I actually bought that 17 inch PowerBook because I was using Photoshop to manipulate this aerial photography for my dad's commercial real estate business. The Windows laptop I was on kept crashing. I was like, dad, I got to get a Mac if you want me to keep working on this stuff. Went and paid for it. The experience was night and day working on Photoshop on a 17-inch PowerBook than it was whatever crappy Windows machine I was using at the time. And so there was this fervor for the platform in that time that I think was the perfect setup. And also coming into the iPhone, there was enough of that groundswell of people like me. I was in China when Apple announced the iPhone. I went to the internet cafe at a Beijing hotel to watch a live blog of the Macworld keynote that you were at when they announced the original iPhone because there was just that level of fervor. And then six months later, my brother and I go get in line to buy the first iPhone. There was that passion, and then by the time they announced the SDK that next year, I jumped into it because I thought this is going to be something. I saw something different about the platform, and so much of that had been built up through Apple's experience across the decades building platforms of the turnaround of the Mac, of building the foundations with Cocoa and stuff like that. That ended up becoming the iPhone. And then by the time the iPhone App Store was released, there was this groundswell of developers who were just so excited about the platform. They could not build an app for this platform. It wasn't just original Mac developers. That was one of the fascinating things, you alluded to it earlier, is that a lot of the Mac developers didn't really do well on the iPhone because they were maybe a little too caught up in what they had built for the Mac. What we saw happen when the App Store launched with so many new companies being built, new ideas being explored, and just this fervor for building for the platform. John Gruber: There was a skill set that transferred immediately where somebody who is really fluent as a developer in Objective-C and the AppKit APIs on the Mac could immediately jump over, because it was just more limited. It was like AppKit but a lot more limited. But in terms of the syntax and the style of the APIs, they could just jump right in and thrive in a way that a developer who's familiar with Java at the time, which was super popular, or the Windows C++ APIs was like, what the hell's going on here with all the square brackets? But in terms of the concepts for what an app should be and do in the scope of it, it wasn't a mini Mac. It still isn't, but especially in 2008, 2009, it just was so much more limited and the context of where and how people would use it was so different that it just at a conceptual level be thinking in a very different way, not quite as profound. But along the lines of the difference between the purely command line interfaces of the early PC era where you just had text on a screen versus a graphical user interface. It was the same difference where it was like, hey, people are just going to sometimes open your app and want to use it like tap, tap done and get out. You could have Mac apps at the time where you'd launch the app and it would show a splash screen. It was a whole term of art like, Photoshop and Adobe apps famously would take 30, 40 seconds to launch because they were such big apps. Well, that made no sense on the iPhone. If you had that mindset like, I have this idea for an app, but it's going to take 20 seconds to launch, well, people would just be like, nah, screw this. I'm hitting the home button and deleting the app before it finished launching. David Barnard: To bring back the developer relations thread, WWDC 2008, which you were at, one of my big regrets in life is not going to WWDC 2008 because I founded my company April of that year to build iPhone apps. I had borrowed money from my family. I felt this tension of am I spending my family's hard-earned money that they've invested in me to go on a vacation to San Francisco to this developer conference? And so I did not go. What I heard in retrospect was that they were actually signing up developer accounts in person at WWDC that year. Could have been there day one had I gone, but this was the first time WWDC ever sold out. I've heard stories about past WWDC. They would be giving away tickets. They would be begging developers to come, and at WWDC 2008 was the first time it sold out. And then from then on, that groundswell of developer and the platform becoming so powerful, they never again had to ask developers to come. It was sold out every year after that, eventually having to go to a lottery. And then there's one more point I wanted to make was that at WWDC 2008, the slides from the presentations had the email addresses of Apple evangelists on the slide because they're like, hey, email us. We need more feedback. We want to know what's going on. Even as successful as the Mac platform had become, this was still pre iPhone Apple and pre the iPhone platform becoming what it became was such a different Apple. Funny story, because I had not gotten a developer account, I sent an email to five of the people- John Gruber: On the slides. David Barnard: On the slides. John Galenzi of all people responded to the email, gave me a phone call. I mean, to this day I remember he actually just retired from Apple. I had a lovely chat with him a couple of weeks ago at WWDC on the side because he's no longer at Apple anymore. John Gruber: No, he's no longer at Apple, but I saw him at WWDC. David Barnard: Yeah. Such an incredible human. But evangelists would put their email on the slides. It's just hard in 2025 how secretive, how close, how we choose you, you don't choose us. How hard it is to get the attention of Apple for the average developer. That was the era before the iPhone platform became so big. John Gruber: It was clearly a surprise to Apple. The whole idea that jobs had to be talked into opening up an API. I think that's overstated a little to some degree. I was going to say how much of that was just him blustering? Well, the difference is between should there be third-party apps for iPhone versus should the iPod support Windows. Now, Jobs wholeheartedly was against supporting Windows. He really was 100% on board with the iPod as a thing to help sell the Mac. Making it a Mac-only peripheral was in Apple's interest because it would bolster the Mac and every other executive from Schiller to whoever else was like, we're holding back the iPod as a platform by not supporting Windows. There's multiple books that he have written about it where he's like, all right, fine, go do it, but don't bother me. I don't want to know about it. And then he called it the iTunes for Windows, the Glass of ice water in hell. He was happy once it came out and he could see it and he could say that, he was happy, but he was really against it. I don't think he was against opening the iPhone, I just think he thought someday. I do think that maybe it happened a little faster than he thought. I don't think he anticipated announcing it in 2007. In fact, at 2007, WWDC was when they announced their "sweet solution" for third party developers, which was a very small JavaScript library where you could make some web apps that looked like native iPhone apps. They wouldn't have announced that in June on the cusp of the iPhone going on sale if they really thought, hey, we're going to have a native SDK early next year. It was September, October where they just made an announcement like, sure, all right, fine. We heard you. We're going to open an SDK. Give us a couple of months to get it together. We'll get back to you when it's ready. I think he thought it was like, we'll get to it in a couple of years, but I think it already was proving more popular and more resonant than he thought. I think Jobs and everybody at Apple knew this iPhone was a hit. They knew it was a thing. They weren't surprised that it was in sensation when they announced it, but it was even more resonant and more of a hit and bled out to more normal people. The iPhone first came out in 2007, right away in the summer of 2007, I'd be at Whole Foods and I'd have a shopping list in a Web App and Randos would just come up to me and be like, is that an iPhone? Is that an iPhone. All the time. I don't think Apple was anticipating that level of broad consumer appeal and it accelerated that. The WWDC thing is a perfect example. Before the iPhone, they had a whole extra track at WWDC. They called it the IT Track for IT professionals who managed Mac installations in corporate environments. It was because they had room, I don't know, I'm just ball parking, 3000 developers, but then 2000 IT professionals and a whole different track of sessions where instead of talking about APIs for making Mac Apps, it was sessions related to the very serious, a reasonable topic for a conference, but it was almost like two conferences in one. One for developers and one for IT professionals, just because they wanted to fill up Moscone and they had room. With the iPhone, it was like, oh, we got to get rid of that. There was this whole resentment because, it was I think a very good and successful and popular conference for IT professionals, but when the popularity of the iPhone happened, it was like, oh, they got to go. And then it became, even Mac developers felt like, hey, this used to be all about the Mac and now it's session after session after session is just about the iPhone. David Barnard: We've talked about a lot of things that are ultimately almost a fluke of history that things played out the way they did from Bill Gates saving Apple and all those things. I can't help but think. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit for it, but very soon after the iPhone was released, the developers jailbroke the iPhone and started writing native apps for it. Craig Hockenberry is one name I will call out. I wonder if that jailbreak scene and seeing what developers were building under insane constraints. Because when you jailbroke, Apple hadn't documented APIs. It wasn't a real SDK. Developers were having to reverse engineer methods they could call and how things were working. I can't help but think that some of jobs changing his mind so quickly was because of how innovative and how passionate that base was. I mean, I ended up buying it. When I started my company, I bought a second iPhone because I was too nervous to jailbreak my own iPhone. I bought a second iPhone, jailbroke it and installed all these apps for me as a way to study what apps could do. It's like you could study as a developer in 2008 before the App Store was launched and you had 500 apps to poke around to see what people were doing. I jailbroke a phone specifically to understand what could be done and what people were doing and what was going on with the platform. I can't help but think that Hockenberry and Steve Troughton-Smith and some of those other early jailbreak folks had an influence on the SDK actually coming out as quickly as it did. John Gruber: Yeah. I think Jobs appreciated that. Lucas Newman, who was at the Luscious library at the time and then went to Apple. I think it got him hired by Apple. I haven't heard from him in a while. I also know that, I think this is a public story, but Lucas Newman wrote the first game. It was called Lights Off, wholly backwards engineered, entirely. Hockenberry came out with a version of Twitterrific that was a native app before the year was out without any SDK from Apple, but building apps for the iPhone through Xcode. Just bananas to me that this happened. But I think Jobs appreciated that mindset because of all the crazy nonsense him and Woz had done back in the day before they founded was. Before they founded Apple making the little blue boxes that would let you make free long-distance calls on a payphone and stuff. The enthusiasm was just so much stronger where it was like they'd be crazy not to hold it back. David Barnard: Then March 6th, 2008 a date seared into my memory, they announced the iPhone SDK. This is again where I think people in 2025 don't appreciate what a different era that was in terms of what was possible as a developer to build a business. I wrote a business investment thesis that I sent to my dad and mom and uncle who ultimately invested in the company. I specifically wrote in there, what an incredible deal this is that I don't have to host my own store. Because back then, I mean, again, so easy to forget in this era of Stripe and AWS back ends and everything like that, that standing up your own web server to distribute apps, especially if it's a larger app, could get very expensive. Bandwidth was expensive. Working with third-party, payment platforms was a hassle. You needed a whole team to sort all that stuff out. And so when Apple announced the iPhone- John Gruber: Especially on a phone, right? David Barnard: Yeah. John Gruber: Credit card would be even harder. There was no way to scan it, no tap to pay. David Barnard: The only software that was on phones at the time was carrier build. You had to do a deal with a carrier and they took 50% of everything. The App Store was genuinely a revolution in software of a revolution of opportunity for developer. I mean, this is what I built my career on. This is why I have such a soft place in my heart and I'm so obsessed to this day with the App Store because it just fundamentally changed the opportunity you had as a developer to build a business. Of course that's not true anymore in 2025 with Stripe and hosted Back ends and Bandwidth being essentially free and all these third-party SaaS tools that you could spin up a Web App. I mean, geez, now even in Vibe coding where you don't even need a backend or hardly any experience to spin up a Web App that's just hosted on Replit. You can charge for it via built-in payment solutions. It's just crazy how much different the world is today than it was for that original App Store release. I think people today forget just how powerful that was. We were talking about this before we hit record trying to do the math. There are kids today, teenagers releasing apps on the App Store whose parents probably weren't even alive when Schiller and Cue and Joswiak joined Apple in the '80s. You could be a 16-year-old developer with a 40-year-old parent who wasn't even alive when all of this started with the Macintosh in 1984, much less 1976 when Apple was founded. I think there is a little bit of a loss of history and then maybe at Apple a little too much recognition of history of here we are in 2025 and the world has completely changed. The iPhone helped change the world 17 years ago, but now it's been 17 years since the world changed. People today looking from the outside without this history, I don't think appreciate the things that Apple appreciates. They don't have the context and the history. I think when you're trying to understand how Apple operates, why they're so insistent on the App Store fees and other things like that, you have to ignore all of that history, which to people's credit they don't even know. That's why we're doing this podcast. To understand Apple, you have to go back those 40 years and see all of what it took to get to the iPhone and then the iPhone becoming the platform it is and the billions and trillions of dollars that the platform has generated for third-party developers, that's hard not to just appreciate. John Gruber: To some extent at this point, it's becoming clear that Apple itself has fallen into the same trap. I'll exemplify it with a quote. I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm hopefully going to soon turn it into some article on Daring Fireball. There's a Steve Jobs quote. It's actually, Apple's made a big plaque of it, huge. It's, I don't know, 10 feet diagonal. It hangs not at Apple Park, but outside the Town Hall Theatre at the old Infinite Loop campus. The quote is, if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next. I think with the App Store in particular, boy that really resonate. It's not that they should forgo all profit and all commissions from the App Store, the whole, well, we started with 70/30. We should stick with 70/30. We've never raised it from 70/30 even when it's become more powerful or more monopoly, whatever you want to call it. David Barnard: As they've increased in control and the platform has increased in importance, they could have increased and squeezed and other things. John Gruber: Right. The people at Apple who are insisting on keeping as much of the commission's and the rules and everything as they have, but especially when it comes to payments and letting people link out to the web and stuff like that. They're thinking, hey, we built this thing that was so much more generous and developer friendly than everything that came before it on handhelds or, especially on phones. That they're still caught up in thinking of what it was in 2008 as opposed to that Jobs's quote, if you build something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. I feel like Apple is dwelling on the success and the innovation, true innovation, profound innovation that absolutely shook up and completely revolutionized the phone industry more than Apple even revolutionized the PC industry, but they're dwelling on it for too long. That they should move on and build something else new and start conceding on that issue. I think it is something that they've lost when they lost Steve Jobs. People think that they lost the ability to make new things, that it was always his ability to drive them to make a new thing. But I think he was good at, okay, fine. Again, I mentioned that whole iPod for Windows thing where he stuck with it for a year or two and then he was like, okay, fine, fine. At some point the people holding onto all of these rules and healing all these decisions about the anti-steering and stuff. Somebody at the top named Tim Cook should probably just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's just give in on a lot of this. We don't have to worry about it anymore. Just clear it off our concerns. I think it would be so good for Apple to just clear it off the table and just clear their time and their energy and their talent from executives down to engineers to just figure out what's next and make something new that would build into something where they have to worry about this again in 10 or 15 years. David Barnard: I want to dig into what I will affectionately call App Store 3.0 because I completely agree, but let's step back one more point in history. I have a bunch of notes. We could go through all of the early iPhone days. It's hard for people who don't even know that there weren't in-app purchases, that you had paid upgrades. That in order to do a paid upgrade, you had to release a whole new app and then transition users to it. There's so many points on the App Store history of just oddities and stubbornness and weird things that Apple did in those early days, even as the platform started taking off. But in 2016, Phil Schiller did a round of interviews. I think the one that most concisely covers it, maybe the one he gave the most access to was Verge. They titled the article App Store 2.0. And so in hindsight now I will give this way more credit than I think I did at the time of, it really was App Store 2.0. It really did fuel what we see as the current era of the platform. They open up subscriptions to all apps, which obviously working at RevenueCat and now all my apps are subscription. I know some users still bulk at it, but from a developer's perspective and being able to fund the creation of great software and continue working on it, that was revolution. That was App Store 2.0 to empower developers to better monetize apps. They sped up app review significantly. Again, if you weren't around a decade ago, you don't remember the days when it was seven days, 14 days to get an app through App Review. As much as you might complain about App Review today, at least you get that rejection in 24 hours to 48 hours instead of seven to 14 business days. They dropped the commission to 15% on year one renewal. If you started a subscription, that first commission would be 30, and then after that would be 15%. They announced App Store search ads as a new way to pay to get users. As much as we can complain about name squatting and having to pay to defend your brand, it's an incredible opportunity to be able to pay and get in front of people right there in the App Store. It's actually the paid acquisition channel that I recommend any App Store with. If you're struggling to get downloads, the first thing you should do is start figuring App Store search ads. That was App Store 2.0. They started removing a lot of these old apps that weren't working or just crappy apps. They started to purge the App Store and curate it a little bit more. That was App Store 2.0 in 2016. Looking back now almost a decade since. It really was a profound shift in the App Store that has led to so much of what we now get to experience as the App Store would not have happened had they not loosened the reins in those ways and made those changes. And so as much as we talk about, I complain on Twitter about Apple being obstinate and not changing and being stuck in the past and everything like that. The App Store 2.0 was them changing. Did they go on an apology tour? Did they, whatever? No. But they made very fundamental changes to the App Store that propelled it for this last decade. To your point, this is what I want to get back to today in 2025, is that it really does feel like we are in need of App Store 3.0, a deeper, more fundamental rethink of the opportunity. I think to your point, get out of the way. Let developers build. I think the Vision Pro is a good example too of the animosity that has started to build up. The frustrations and everything has gotten to a point where developers are way more wary of Apple. You posted some really great posts this spring, Apple, you're killing my vibe, and then another one by John Siracusa, just about developers seeing Apple more and more as a inconvenience to reaching their users versus a partner in building this incredible platform. The iPhone continues to sell like hotcakes. Apps are making money hand over fist. Developers are building apps, new apps every day. From the outside and looking at the numbers, maybe the platform is fine, but I think this sentiment where developer relations are in 2025 with the lawsuits, with the DMA, with all of the things that are going on, it feels like we're due another reset. Personally, I would love to that be a little bit more like the '97 jobs of like, hey, we did some things that we thought were right at the time and the forthrightness to say, here's why we think this. Here's why we did it. We're changing our mind. We're going to focus on building these great platforms moving forward. What does Apple need for the next decade and the decade after a vibrant developer community who's going to jump on the next day AI platform. Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are tromping at the bit and have billions of dollars to invest to not let this next platform play out the way the smartphone platform played out with Apple having so much control and so much power, maybe it's time for a bigger change. John Gruber: It's just proven so lucrative and forms the backbone of their services, "services that they report financially," which has been their growth vector for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years. Not because interest in the iPhone has decreased, but because clearly the iPhone is literally so popular that every single person in the world who lives somewhere where the iPhone is available and they can afford one and they want one has one. It's that popular that it has peaked because they've run out of people to sell it to. To their credit, it's part of the appeal that they build them to last. That's good for the environment. It's good as just a message that they're durable and the silicon is so good that five, six-year-old iPhones are still very credible devices. I'm running iOS 26 on an iPad from 2018, iPad Pro. It is a little slow. That's a seven-year-old device. The "services" has been their growth for the last seven or eight years. A lot of that comes not, they would like you to think that it's from Apple services, from people paying for iCloud and paying for Apple TV+ and whatever else they sell as a service. But a lot of it comes from their commission from the App Store, but they could decrease their cut and they could open up instead of fighting for these anti-steering things, especially going to the web stuff, which I've been against for years and years. I mean, pretty much ever since it became an issue that this is ridiculous. Especially like in the Kindle exemplifies it. That if the terms of the App Store are such that the Kindle App cannot sell app or books in the app without losing money on each book, which is the way the e-book publishing industry works, where there's a 70/30 split between the bookseller and the publisher and therefore if there's a 70/30 split between the publisher and the platform, they literally lose money on each sale that they'd owe. A $10 book, they would owe $3 to Apple, but they would owe $7 to the publisher and therefore at best would make nothing, so why do it? If you can't sell books through the app because of the terms of your store, you should absolutely let them have a button that says, go here to go buy books on the Kindle website. The idea that they fought that is, it's just absurd, and clearly anti-user. It just exemplifies how they've gotten caught up in thinking way too much that the point of the App Store is for Apple to get a commission on all digital content sales for the platform as opposed to what it should be and could be and should remain going forward, which is... John Gruber: ... could be and should remain going forward which is us maintaining control and having approval over the software and the APIs and what can happen in the background and how things are managed and how privacy is managed in the sandbox and everything is the best for the platform long-term and very much the best interest of the users. It should be that thinking. And then, the fact that we make a lot of money but maybe not as much money for all digital content on the platform because we do have and one of the ways you can do in-app purchases should be icing on the cake, which is clearly how they thought of it at the outset and they should just go back to thinking that. And I really do think that if and when they do, and I think it's a big if, but... And not at the point of regulation. Because if it's at the point of regulation, we see it. They're just going to make it convoluted and complex and the only way this knot is going to get untied is for Apple to willingly say, "You know what? We're going to lower the rate to 80-20 for everyone and 90-10 for small business," or something like that, "And we're going to just drop... If you want to send people outside the app to the web to make the purchases, just give them a button and they'll go to the web to do it." If they did that, I honestly think they would not see a significant decrease. And I think we're going to see that proved out in the coming months and quarters as Apple releases their quarterly finance statements after the recent ruling here in the US, their biggest market, that allows stuff like that. I don't think we're going to see a decrease in services revenue, now that they've been forced to open this up. So why not just open it up worldwide and make it easier for everyone and stop hanging the sword of Damocles over everybody that, "Hey, if we win an appeal in a year or two, we're going to revoke this access that you've now gotten at the point of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' legal declaration." It's better for the platform. Just make people happy. Make developers happy and users happy and Apple will profit from it. They really will. David Barnard: It does seem like dropping the fee would be a huge change in developer relations, in developer sentiment. I would hope they would go all the way down to 85-15 and I think there's Ben Thompson- John Gruber: And maybe something different for games maybe because- David Barnard: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Maybe games stay at 70-30 because that's what Sony and Nintendo and Steam and everybody else charges. Except for Epic with their App Store, but they obviously have reasons to artificially put that lower. But I can't help but think it would change the tone with the industry more broadly and be more in line with the reality of 2025. Now, you can argue, well, you're not just paying for payment fees. I think that's a disingenuous argument that a lot of people make. It's like, "Oh, Stripe is 3%. Why should we be paying Apple 30% for payments?" Well, you're not paying Apple 30% for payments and this is the argument Apple continues to make is that it's a platform fee. But there's a couple of things in there. One, it's almost a fluke of history that Jobs, in that original iPhone announcement said, "Hey, if you have a free app, we're going to distribute it for free and it doesn't cost you anything." And at the time, that was great and that created companies like Facebook and Uber and others where they might not have been able to make it work. Well, Facebook is a bad example because they were already reasonably profitable, but the iPhone certainly did springboard them even further. John Gruber: Yeah. But I would argue that the company is... It's not just that they adjusted and adapted to mobile. Meta, today, is unrecognizable from the Facebook of 2007. And in hindsight, they were clearly meant for mobile. To the point where they've got products that people use entirely on mobile, right? You can technically use Instagram on the web, but the vast majority of Instagram users have never once used it on the web. David Barnard: But would Instagram exist as it is today if they had to pay 50 cents per download or had to pay per user? John Gruber: Right, right. It is a quirk that Apple... Because Apple was coming at it from the mindset of the way the Mac worked. That there were free apps, but that any company that wanted to run the business from the app would be selling copies of the app. You'd buy the app before you installed it and that was Apple's mindset. And again, they were selling copies of their operating system at the time. If you bought a Mac that had Mac OS 10.2 installed and wanted to upgrade to 10.3, it cost $129 and it cost 100 some dollars or I don't even know what it cost to get Pages and Numbers and Keynote. All of that stuff was for sale for what would, today, strike people as bananas amounts of money and that was their thinking of how software would be sold. And I think the idea of a company and... Meta exemplifies it. That a company, like one of the five biggest companies in the world purely making software... Well, I mean I know they have got the glasses and stuff now too. But like Microsoft, primarily a software company, would be making all their money by giving apps away and only having ads in the app? It just didn't compute at the time and they never foresaw that... It's sort of a loophole. And if it costs them 50 cents a download per user per year, they could afford that very easily. David Barnard: They could. But then, would Instagram have been created? So many companies who have been built on top of it, could they have done it? But in 2025, when you look at the state of the world of Airbnb making billions of dollars, Uber making billions of dollars, Meta making billions of dollars, Google making billions of dollars on the iOS platform and not having to pay a penny other than $100 a year developer account. And here I am, indie developer supporting my family. I've paid Apple over a million dollars. I think closing in on $2 million in my 17-year history. Is that fair? And in the world of 2025, that just seems bananas like, "Why have I paid Apple $2 million for my dinky little indie apps and Meta has paid Apple $100 a year for 17 years?" It's bizarre. If you erase 40 years of history, if you erase all the context that we've built up to this point, and you just look at it as a logical person in 2025, that just seems bananas that I am paying so much to Apple and Meta is paying zero. John Gruber: I do think that was some of the thinking behind the core technology fee for the EU DMA compliance plan where it was sort of like, "What would we do if we did it all over again?" And I think that 50 cents per user per year fee for million plus download apps only was sort of thinking this is what they would do all over again. But the irony of that is that they're even walking away from that now, because the EU has said that the CTF is not compliant with the DMA. So they're switching to a core technology fee or commission which, again, is only on in-app purchases. So again, if you have a super popular app like Instagram that you can use without ever making a digital goods transaction through it, Apple makes nothing but the $100 a year developer fee. I do think they are thinking of it and they tried. The CTF was sort of their attempt but it is sort of a tricky position. But I think the answer to that is, "Hey, maybe you should just be happy that you own this platform and not worry about how much money you make from it," and, again, like that Steve Jobs quote. And just make something else wonderful and go on and really refocus on getting developers to say, "If I didn't have to answer to my boss or what I'm telling my boss and manager, I think we should do is put our efforts into making awesome software for these Apple platforms." To get that developer enthusiasm back I think is worth more to the company than whatever money they're making by breeding pure resentment with the current policy. And I don't want to let it slide, because you mentioned it but I want to emphasize it, that one of those differences between visionOS today and the original Mac in 1984, 1985 at this point based on where we are in visionOS's life, is that even though the Mac wasn't popular in 1985, there was this blossoming ecosystem of Native Mac software, even though the market share wasn't there. Because of the enthusiasm developers had who were like, "Oh my god. People..." It just clicked in their heads like, "This is the computer of the future. I want to make software for it." And we're not seeing that for Vision. We really aren't. There are cool apps and it's not a dead platform but it's nowhere near... visionOS today is nowhere near as vibrant a third party developer ecosystem as the Mac was in 1985 or 1986. And I think that should be the red flag for Apple and I think they might be a little surprised by that. I don't think they're surprised by the number of Vision Pro headsets they've sold, but I think they are a little disappointed and surprised by the lack of developer enthusiasm for the platform. And I think it's entirely because developers are so resentful of the way that Apple has treated them, specifically around finance and payments, that sort of thing. We can argue about the rules on background processing and stuff like that in sandboxing and stuff that apps would like to do. But it's really the resentment... First and foremost, numbers one, two, and three on the list of reasons why developer relations are strained with Apple has to do with money. Anybody who says otherwise is wrong. And Apple doesn't need money. Again, they are not operating on narrow profit margins. Their profit margins have gone up, not down. David Barnard: This is the tricky point though and this is me listening to too much Ben Thompson, but the tricky thing for Apple at this stage though is that the services revenue is so important to the growth narrative around the stock. That even though they don't need the money, they need the money to continue growing the stock at the pace it's growing. And that's the rock and a hard place that they've gotten themselves into is that the services narrative is so strong and that quarter-over-quarter growth in services revenue and services profit when the hardware has kind of started to flatline a little bit- John Gruber: I don't want to interrupt you. But it's like the Exxon Mobil's of the world ran into this problem when they were on top of this market cap lists where it's like, "Well, how many more cars and motorcycles and airplanes consuming fossil fuels could we have, right?" It's like everybody who could have one had one and they're not going to make cars that purposefully consume more fuel. There comes a point where a product or a service or a category really does max out in terms of human population and it's a good place to be. But if your mindset as a Wall Street investor is growth, growth, growth, how much more could they grow, right? David Barnard: Yeah. And maybe this is where we need to go back to this Steve quote from 1997 and maybe the message is as much to Wall Street as it is to developers and Apple saying to Wall Street, "We're going to need to take some lumps, potentially like you and I have said, I mean, if they dropped the fee to 15%, would they lose money? Maybe, but maybe Netflix would come back to the App Store. Maybe... In my job at RevenueCat, I talk to so many developers who are just, "Web, web, web, web, web. We're trying to push as much as we can to the web. We're going to experiment with pushing out of the app into the web now because it's more profitable. We want to save on that 30%." And so, if they drop the fee and it just didn't even make sense to charge on the web. Because at RevenueCat, we did some experiments and Netflix did some experiments with Apple, early in the Epic case, I think it came out that their number was somewhere around that like 12 to 13%. Where if the fee had been dropped that low, it would still be more profitable to operate in the App Store than outside the App Store. And then, there's a lot of complicating factors now too of owning the relationship and would Netflix want Apple to be an intermediary? Well, guess what? If Apple were a more friendly intermediary, maybe they wouldn't mind so much and they would just pick the one that was more profitable on the dollar for dollar basis. John Gruber: We know it's a solvable problem because there are more platforms for signing up customers that give the owner of the service, the newsletter, the streaming service, the music service, whatever it is, more direct relationship with their customers. We've seen them built, so Apple could obviously build one into the App Store. Instead of making all these entitlements over linkouts and stuff like that make it an entitlement where you kind of have to qualify and have these restrictions on, "Well, do you have a customer service department? What's your refund policy? We're going to enforce that you have a customer friendly refund policy where you don't have to call a 1-800 number and listen to somebody try to talk you out of unsubscribing. We're going to test it. That's part of app review, where it has to be as easy to unsubscribe as to subscribe. Otherwise, we will pull your entitlement." But then, if you qualify on those terms and you have those policies in place, you can have more of a direct relationship with your customers. Do whatever it takes to make developers happy to be building for the Apple platforms. Instead, they're clearly focusing on, how can we extract a decent enough portion of the revenue that's conducted on these platforms? David Barnard: Yeah. And so, taking liberties with the Steve Jobs quote from '97, "Apple's going to need to take some lumps in the coming months, but we're going to take it like an adult and I'm proud of that. And the result of that focus, focusing more on developers and building a fantastic platform over extracting as much revenue as we can from that platform, we and third party developers are going to build some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." I shitpost on Twitter about Apple all the time and I know a lot of people inside Apple don't like me for some of those posts. But what I care about deeply is this App Store platform- John Gruber: Join the club. David Barnard: Yeah. You recently. It's that you and I care unreasonably about this platform. On an earlier podcast with Ben Thompson, I love this quote from him, he said, "It just breaks my teenage heart to see Apple continuing down this path that it's going on." And I think that you and I both have gotten to this level of frustration with developer relations and what Apple's doing and the way they're operating. Not because we hate Apple and want to see them fail. And not because we're just take joy in ridiculing them or complaining and criticizing them publicly. It's just that we care so deeply and we see the path that they're on and we don't think it's right. And if you take these 40 years of history, you can kind of justify things and you can see how internally they can justify it and see it this way and see it that way. John Gruber: Somehow, they've gotten attached to this income that they've extracted from commissions in the App Store in a way that they've never been attached to other things. I mean, you and I mentioned this during this podcast about the upgrade charge they used to charge for operating systems, $129 to go from Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4. They used to charge $5 to upgrade iOS. They clearly, at that time, were trying to get away from it, but they thought the accounting rules they were trying to follow required them to do it. They've given up on that knowing that it was better for them overall. In theory, you think, "Well, why would you ever... If people were doing it and lining up outside Apple stores to buy boxed versions of the software for $129 to upgrade their existing Mac, why would you ever do away with that if it was so popular that they were lining up?" But in the grand scheme of things, it clearly was the right decision to just make the operating system upgrades free to encourage all users to upgrade and to sort of steer them towards automatic updates, because they can do that because they're not charging. They couldn't do the automatic OS updates that most people, with their default settings on a Mac or iPad or iPhone, just at some point a couple months after the dot O, there's a version they think is stable enough. And overnight, while your phone's charging, you get the new... You're going to have iOS 26 in November or December this year. And they can only do that because they're not charging for it and it's better for them overall. Obviously, they've never made more money, their profits and revenue are at record highs. I think the same thing is true of the commissions in the App Store that, yes, at some level, if you're the CFO at Apple, you're like, "Well, why in the world would we ever decrease this? If we don't legally have to, why would we ever give up a penny of it? It's a lot of money." But it'll all work out in the end in terms of... And Joz himself has mentioned this in multiple of the interviews he did do last month at WWDC. He said the same thing to me and it was an off the record briefing I had with him and it was very cordial and nice. I am sure he won't mind me repeating it because he mentioned it on the record with Joanna Stern and multiple people where one of the things Steve Jobs often said, "If we make great products and tell people about them," that's the marketing part from his perspective, "tell them why they're great, it'll all work out in the end." That's just as true of the App Store as anything else, but it's this one area where they've got a compulsive institutional obsession with squeezing it that they do not need. David Barnard: And speaking of flukes of history, one of the... I think it was an epic case found an email from Schiller to Jobs saying, "What if we cap App Store revenue to Apple at $100 dollars?" Which at the time seemed- John Gruber: No, I think it was a billion. I think it was a billion- David Barnard: Was a billion? Okay. John Gruber: I think it was a billion. David Barnard: Or even a billion. It was like at the point in time when he wrote that, it probably sounded crazy like, "How will we ever make that much money on the App Store?" But then now, in hindsight it's like, "Oh my gosh. That's such a tiny amount to what they're making now." But had Jobs been convinced of that and had they announced publicly, "We're going to cap Apple's revenue on the App Store-" John Gruber: Or even if they never announced it publicly, David Barnard: Right. It became internal policy. John Gruber: Yeah. And that once it hit a billion, they dropped it to 75-25 and it stayed at a billion and it was growing some more and then they could drop it to 80-20. Then eventually, 85-15. Who knows? By now, they'd probably be at 90-10 or 93-7 or something like that. And at certain level then without ever having announced that, they could stop. If it had ever gotten even to 90-10, they could stop and say, "Well, now, we can just sort of let it grow because 10 is pretty fair." And yes, it's not the 2.7% Stripe takes or whatever, but 7% is arguably pretty good deal for everything the App Store offers. David Barnard: And imagine how different the last decade of developer relations would have been had Apple capped it at that. And then, the incentive wasn't for the financial side of things. The incentive was to build a fantastic platform for developers and empower them to serve our customers and keep innovating. John Gruber: And encourage developers and designers and even the companies and managers at those... Who aren't nerds and are into the platform, but just to encourage as much as they can, the mindset of, "Maybe we should build this for Apple platforms exclusively, because of the great APIs and capabilities and... Why even bother with these other platforms? We don't make any money on them. We're doing so great iOS only." They've really gotten away from that. It's to Apple's benefit in obvious ways to have as many developers as possible making Apple platform exclusive software. And at this point, there's such a resentment that to so many people, whether they're managers or executives or developers or just users who are like, "Well, you'd be crazy to build for Apple only because they're sort of against you in terms of trying to just take your money." David Barnard: As a long-term Apple watcher and being friends with so many developers. What do you think it would take? Is a reset even in the cards for Apple at this point? Would it take Phil Schiller on stage at the iPhone 18 whatever- John Gruber: They don't do anything on stage- David Barnard: ... keynote. Well, you're right. But what would it take to get a reset? Above the... I mean- John Gruber: I don't know. David Barnard: ... the money would probably go a long way like, "Okay. We're just going to drop the rate." But it does almost feel like there needs to be some level of that 1997 Jobs' humility of like, "Hey, we made some mistakes. You're going to see a new Apple moving forward." John Gruber: Yeah. But I think you don't have to do it... I don't think it's within Apple to say, "We made some mistakes and we're going to change," even though that's sort of how he addressed. He was willing to say that at WWDC 1997 because what they were scrapping were things that weren't under him, right? OpenDoc and Newton and everything else they scrapped. They weren't Jobs-led post next reunification projects. The Apple way of doing it would be to act like, "We've come up with this amazing new idea that only Apple could do and it's totally innovative and nobody else has ever suggested it before. And it's called taking less money from the App Store," right? And not apologizing and not saying... Presenting it as a new opportunity in the same way that they're pitching the liquid glass of iOS 26 as, "Hey, the capabilities of the hardware and the GPU and the screen display technology with HDR is such that we're able to present this interface that we couldn't have done before." Just present it as the market opportunities and the success of the iPhone are such that we're able to have a new financial set of rules around the App Store that we couldn't have done before, even though they could have. But just say that they couldn't. David Barnard: It's just frustrating on a human level. It's like at work, when I do something stupid or whatever, you apologize. There's just humanity in that level of humility that it is just frustrating to me on a human level. John Gruber: But that would count as an apology, right? It would. Because we'd know. David Barnard: For us as Apple followers, it would. But I think in 2025, the press would have a field day with that and just call BS in a way that I don't know that it would work. And this is kind of something I've been thinking more and more is that Apple needs to do some things on Apple, like to adjust to the realities of 2025 and to set themselves up for the next decade as a platform for developers as a consumer brand and everything else. For example, the small business program was so freaking Apple-like. Instead of just saying, "Hey, 15% for the first million, 30% for everything after," there was all these rules. You got to get into the program and then you get kicked out of the program and they created all these weird... To me, that's just the perfect example of how Apple over does things. And so, to usher in an App Store 3.0, I think we need to see them do things un-Apple-like. And I think that... Again, it's the fanboy in me just wanting to see a new version of Apple. Not that I hate Apple, not that I think they're idiots inside Apple, not that I think anything poor of them as a company, I want to see them succeed. I want to wear Apple glasses, not Meta glasses with a camera on them. And I think there's aspects of what they're building and the trust they've built with consumers and everything else that is setting them up for potentially being that next human computing platform. But having developers on your side and enthusiastic about it is going to be a huge, huge, huge boon. And given how competitive Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are and will be in the coming years, maybe it does require a bit deeper of a reset and doing some things that aren't traditionally how Apple operates. I think even this WWDC was a little bit of a reckoning in that Ben Thompson got it, you got it. Some people got it like, "Hey, this is Apple not overpromising so that they can overdeliver." But the press had a field day with like, "Oh, it's a boring..." They're so far behind on AI and all that kind of stuff. John Gruber: Nobody remembers that though. I mean, it's news for a week and here we are a month out and I think it's already forgotten. And I think Apple should have the fortitude, and the wisdom and you've mentioned at the outset, that their leadership's been there for so long. They remember this, they know how it goes, and they should just be confident in themselves in that way. The other thing about the fact that so many of the senior leaders have been there for so long, it means that most of them are nearing retirement. Schiller has stepped down and is in a different position as an Apple fellow. He still runs events, he still runs the App Store. Tim Cook is... I forget how many. What year? 64 or something like that? Or 63. Eddy Cue and Joz are in their 60s. And I'm not saying any of them are leaving soon. I mean, I'm sure none of them are going to pre-announce their retirements. But in terms of setting things up for the next generation of senior leadership at Apple, which is coming sooner rather than later, right? It's coming over the next decade, across the board, I think that they need to reset the institutional priorities of the company, because the new generation won't have that experience from the '90s that you brought up on this show to explain this. And instead if they took over right now, will just have the mindset of, "Oh, the way Apple works is they expect 30% of all the money on the platform." That's just the way it is and that they don't have any history behind it or why, but that they think that. As opposed to thinking that the most important thing Apple should do is encourage stoke and keep going in an ongoing relationship developer enthusiasm for building exclusive software for our platforms. And making it as great as possible and thinking, "Some of the best software experiences on our platforms are going to come from our third party developers, not from Apple." And that that's the way it should be. And we shouldn't be thinking that all of the best software comes from Apple and it's an afterthought what third parties make. David Barnard: And to your point, I hadn't thought of this until you've brought it up, that in setting things up for the future, I think there is onus on the current executives to not hold on to the past for the next decade when it's then too late. They're in the position, today, and having been at Apple 40 years... But one of the impressive things about Meta these past decade is that as a founder-led company, Zuckerberg put $100 billion into Reality Labs and is force of will and telling shareholders, "Hey, we're making these massive investments and they're going to pay off." And now, he's doing the same with AI, $100 million checks to lure AI talent. That's not something the stock market normally would reward, but he is out there pitching the world that, "Hey, this is an investment worth making and we're going to make it." And I think these Apple executives who've been there 40 years are the best people to say and convince the world, "Hey, we need to make some investments on the developer front and that's going to involve less services revenue," or whatever it has to be. But it's going to pay off in spades in the long run with the innovation that's going to happen with the renewed developer sentiment and everything else. That they're going to need for this next big platform in the coming 5 to 10 years. And it may be too late if they hold on. John Gruber: Well, I agree. David Barnard: Well, I think that's a fantastic place to wrap it up. And really, what I wanted to say on this podcast and hopefully people have gotten that depth of history of when you're frustrated with Apple about this policy or that, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than... And I mean even, again, as much as I complain on Twitter, I'll acknowledge that I lack a ton of context and I lack a lot of insight. And I'm sure I can understand why people inside Apple are frustrated at the way I frame things sometimes. But when you take all of that history and everything else into account, something needs to change. I'm not sure exactly what that is and me lobbying is me just throwing out ideas. Happy to be wrong about any of this, anything I'm suggesting. But I hope it's helpful to folks to better understand Apple in these ways. John Gruber: If there's one other point that I'll close with, it would be that I mentioned earlier that the problem Apple found itself in the early '90s when Jobs was exiled was this they were caught in this '80s mindset of every couple years, a new platform replaces the old platform and the old platform goes away. When, in fact, the Macintosh was here to stay and they just weren't treating it that way. I'd say Apple's come full circle now and views its platforms as institutions that are there to last decades, including, well, all of the platforms that they have. Including the Mac, which started in 1984. But the iPhone certainly, iPad, even the lesser ones like Watch and tvOS And I think visionOS are things that they intend to last for decades which, at this point, will last well past the careers of the senior leadership at the company. And I think they have that mindset. But I think they're currently doing some things and, again, related to money, just the goddamn money, that are contrary to fostering that. But it's this long-term mindset that the company has that these platforms are institutions and that Apple at a whole is an institution that is meant to be here for a very long time. David Barnard: And if they don't change... Or maybe they don't have to change, I don't even know. John Gruber: But I think if they don't change, then when new things come, they become legacy only. They're not going to disappear. The iPhone is not going anywhere. But the risk to the company is that they become legacy only maybe like Microsoft would be if they hadn't moved to the cloud, right? If Microsoft was still just about Windows and Office and stuff like that, where they would be? They would miss out on the next thing. That their next thing isn't going to hit unless they have developer buy-in. And that you can easily disguise that with the ongoing revenue and profits from those legacy things. In the same way that Microsoft would still be a very big healthy company, even if they hadn't shifted under Satya Nadella, but they wouldn't be number two or number one in the world right now. David Barnard: Yeah. All right. Well, it's been two and a half hours. I think we do need to wrap up but fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time, John, and this was- John Gruber: Thanks for having me. David Barnard: Glad to have you. John Gruber: This was fun.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.

Title: Rocket Lab Stock Is Up 800% In A Year. Is Now The Time To Buy?

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. Rocket Lab stock is in the stratosphere — skyrocketing 800% over the past year, propelled by a potent mix of explosive launch cadence, major contract wins and mounting anticipation around its upcoming Neutron rocket. Beyond fundamental strength, broader investor rotation into tariff-insulated aerospace names, and SpaceX-related political headwinds have turbocharged the rally. With sentiment now sky-high, the real question is: Can Rocket Lab keep climbing? Let’s break down the key drivers, risks and whether it’s still a buy. Rocket Lab has been feeding off investor excitement around the burgeoning space economy. Beyond offering reliable launch services for small satellites — significant in itself — Rocket Lab is deepening its moat by building an end-to-end space infrastructure platform. With its Electron rocket for small satellite launches, spacecraft platform, satellite components and on-orbit management solutions, Rocket Lab is targeting the full spectrum of the space value chain. This integrated approach strengthens its appeal for procuring large scale government and commercial contracts. Rocket Lab operates through two core segments: launch services and space systems. For the recent first quarter of 2025, space systems represented $87 million, or 70% of revenues, while launch services $35.6 million or 30%. Rocket Lab’s revenue has grown at a stellar pace of 7x, from $62.2 million in 2021 to $436.2 million in 2024, and is estimated to grow to $573.3 million in 2025, representing 31% year-on-year growth. The company is not yet profitable and cash flows are negative. Cash and equivalents at the end of Q1 2025 was $517 million. Backlog as of Q1 2025 was $1.067 billion with 60% attributed to the space systems segment and 40% to launch services. Commercial customers represented 54% of the backlog, while Government customers represented 46%. Rocket Lab expects about 56% of this backlog to be recognized within 12 months. Rocket Lab’s 800% stock surge reflects a blend of recent execution and future potential. Neutron is the main narrative investors are buying into now, even if Rocket Lab’s current fundamentals are still tied to Electron. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s next growth chapter is Neutron, its upcoming next-gen satellite launch vehicle that is central to its shift from small satellite missions to heavier payloads and high-value national security contracts. Neutron builds on the success of Electron, which has logged 3x more successful launches than all other American small launch providers combined over the past decade. If successful, Neutron could emerge as the first credible challenger to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in the medium-lift launch market, breaking into a near-monopoly space and significantly expanding Rocket Lab’s total addressable market. Investors already have a reason to be optimistic: The U.S. Space Force selected Rocket Lab to compete for high-priority, national security missions under its $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Rocket Lab’s launch vehicle for this program will be Neutron. Meanwhile, Electron, which is the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket, remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. The company successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket (as of June 28) and also set a new launch turnaround record, with the mission being the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours. In the first quarter of 2025, Electron achieved a 100% mission success rate, including an impressive, rapid turnaround of three launches in 13 days. This operational excellence continues to win trust and contracts for Electron missions. Rocket Lab sees commercial and government demand for 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test vehicle — HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) is seeing strong demand in the U.S., and beginning to gain traction internationally. Regular hypersonic flight tests are vital to advancing a nation’s defense capabilities, and HASTE is playing a central role. Both The U.S and The United Kingdom have picked HASTE to develop sovereign hypersonic technology for their multibillion dollar defense programs. Rocket Lab is also a key subcontractor under Kratos Defense’s flagship DoD program MACH‑TB 2.0, a $1.45 billion, five-year project to boost the U.S.’s hypersonic testing capabilities. With the latest launch award, Rocket Lab has now secured a total of seven HASTE missions for MACH-TB, underscoring its reliable launch cadence. Critically, Rocket Lab’s U.S.-based, non-China-linked ecosystem is a major asset in an era where national security, tech sovereignty and supply-chain resilience are top priorities. Although there is remarkable progress in the U.S.-China relations, geopolitical setups are never fully reliable and remain a wildcard. So, it is reassuring for investors to know that Rocket Lab is well aligned with Western defense and aerospace priorities. The company sees its current backlog for Electron and HASTE to support a higher average selling price for missions for through 2025 vs. 2024, powering continued gross margin expansion. Non GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 33.4%, above its guidance of 30% to 32%, and is seen expanding to 34% to 36% for the second quarter. On June 30, 2025, Rocket Lab joined the Russell 1000 Growth Index, prompting a wave of passive fund rebalancing worth $200 billion as index-tracking ETFs snapped up RKLB shares. The stock is up 30% from its June 30, closing price of $35.77. Whether Rocket Lab stock will continue to rise, hinges on a successful Neutron launch, and seamless execution of its end-to-end space platform strategy. So far, everything seems to be going right with Neutron. Neutron’s inclusion in the Pentagon’s $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch program is a validation of its strategic alignment with U.S. defense and space priorities, and a potential springboard into high-value defense missions. Neutron is being designed for reuse and frequent launches, which is a critical advancement in space tech that the Department of Defense (DOD) appears highly supportive of. As an endorsement for Neutron’s return-to-Earth capabilities, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has selected Neutron for a mission that supports its broader initiative to explore point-to-point cargo transportation using commercial launch vehicles. The mission will focus on returning payloads to Earth, and is scheduled to fly no earlier than 2026. Rocket Lab has signed a multi-launch agreement with an unnamed commercial satellite constellation operator, under which it will launch two dedicated missions on Neutron starting from mid-2026. The deal marks the start of what could become a larger collaboration, with Neutron likely to play a central role in launching the full constellation. All this interest in Neutron from Government and private customers, while it is still in the pre-launch phase - ups the ante significantly. Neutron has successfully completed its second stage qualification campaign — a major milestone that validates its design, operations and launch readiness for later this year. Rocket Lab said it conducted launch-like operations across the full stack, including flight software, hardware, avionics, and guidance, navigation and control systems. The stage was also proof-tested to more than 25% of its design load, including applying more than 1.3 million pounds of force and tension across the carbon composite structure. Neutron’s Stage 2 is a novel design compared to traditional rockets. Instead of being supported from the bottom, Stage 2 is suspended from the top of Stage 1’s tank, enabling a very lightweight structure. Retiring the risk associated with this novel configuration early on was a strategic priority. Stage 2’s structural design closely mirrors that of Stage 1, so this successful test campaign also helped de-risk critical elements of the first stage. Per Rocket Lab’s earnings call in May, Neutron Stage 2 is now going through final assembly and will be shipped to the launch site in the next few months in preparation for stage testing with the engine. Neutron’s Stage 1 upper module is also nearing completion. It integrates some of the most complex mechanical systems on the rocket, all of which are expected to perform seamlessly in testing. While most of Neutron is assembled at Rocket Lab’s facilities, the vehicle is shipped in segments to the Launch Complex 3 in Virginia, where it is integrated as a full rocket. The good news is construction at Launch Complex 3 is on schedule and nearing completion. The challenge is the launch site — the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia — has limited maritime infrastructure, and access through the shallow Sloop Gut channel is possible only during favorable tides. Rocket Lab is exploring a workaround with plans for dredging the channel so barges can deliver the segments more reliably. And yes, Rocket Lab still expects to launch Neutron in the second half of this year. Rocket Lab’s plan to build an end-to-end space company is key to its ability to win large-value contracts, so it is imperative that the plans succeed. A key part of this strategy is its pending acquisition of Mynaric, a German company specializing in laser-based satellite communication systems. The deal expands Rocket Lab’s footprint into Europe, and provides access to European programs and growth opportunities. The acquisition is a natural fit: Mynaric already supplies CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals to Rocket Lab under its $515 million Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to produce 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric is also involved in other SDA contracts and shares many clients with Rocket Lab spanning commercial constellation operators, prime contractors and defense and civil government agencies. Rocket Lab plans to scale production and improve efficiencies within Mynaric’s manufacturing process, bolstering its ability to deliver optical terminals on time and on budget. The move should position Rocket Lab to support a broader range of future SDA and defense initiatives. On the spacecraft side, Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft has already launched three missions for Varda Space Industries, supporting in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing and rapid reentry operations. The third mission for Varda was launched within 15 days after the successful return of Varda’s second mission, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s ability to maintain high-cadence launch and reentry space missions. Meanwhile, integration and testing for a fourth and final Pioneer spacecraft is in the works. New product launches like STARRAY, a plug and play, low-cost line of modular solar arrays to meet the power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions, are gaining traction with customers. Rocket Lab has also expanded its suite of Frontier satellite radios that are compatible with the industry’s most important global ground stations. The company has also launched the next generation versions of its popular MAX software packages for satellite guidance and control. Rocket Lab’s MAX software supported the successful Moon landing of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 earlier this year. The MAX software suite is also utilized in both NASA's CAPSTONE mission and DARPA's Blackjack program, as well as in Rocket Lab’s own Pioneer spacecraft for its Varda missions. So, the vertical integration plan appears to be proceeding smoothly. As Rocket Lab gears up to compete on a larger scale, comparisons with industry giant SpaceX are inevitable. SpaceX claims that it represents approximately 80% of the payload mass launched in orbit. Rocket Lab, by contrast, has focused on launching smaller satellites and payloads, but is aiming to facilitate bigger payloads with Neutron. Neutron will be a few tons below the payload capacity of Space X’s Falcon 9, but a Neutron launch is estimated to cost customers an estimated $50-55 million compared to the $67 million price tag for a Falcon 9 launch. On a per-kilogram basis, the cost is more-or-less the same for both. The company expects Neutron launch margins of approximately 50%, with the cost per Neutron launch estimated between $20 million and $25 million. Rocket Lab anticipates flying each reusable Neutron booster 10 to 20 times, comparable with the reuse cadence of a Falcon 9 booster. For long-term, growth-oriented investors, Rocket Lab offers strong upside, subject to achieving key milestones. Some catalysts include: Steep valuation vs. opportunity: Bloomberg recently reported that SpaceX is preparing for an insider share sale that would value the company at around $400 billion, which is nearly 20x bigger than Rocket Lab’s $22.5 billion market cap. Even with a modest narrowing of this enormous valuation gap, the potential upside for Rocket Lab stock could be substantial. Neutron could unlock a larger total addressable market: If Neutron succeeds in the medium lift segment, Rocket Lab could unlock a sizable, multi-billion total addressable market over the next decade, paving the path to profitability and leaving room for further stock upside. Minimal tariff exposure: Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets are made in New Zealand and launched from there. Very few of its Electron launches happen outside of New Zealand. So, the tariff exposure is minimal in its Electron launch business. Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business is intensively domestically sourced. Most manufacturing happens in the U.S., and what is not manufactured in the U.S. still entails high U.S. involvement. Rocket Lab has its manufacturing intensity largely aligned to geographies with minimal tariff exposure. This factor is also key to procuring defense contracts ruled by national security concerns. Increasing launch cadence, a clear path to government-aligned revenue streams, a bold yet calculated bet on the Neutron rocket, strategic vertical integration and a growing backlog give Rocket Lab a foundation that many other space stocks still lack. This suggests that RKLB’s 800% rally over the past year is not merely rooted in hype. That said, the stock’s current valuation, with much of the investor optimism already priced in, leaves little room for missteps. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability.

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. Rocket Lab stock is in the stratosphere — skyrocketing 800% over the past year, propelled by a potent mix of explosive launch cadence, major contract wins and mounting anticipation around its upcoming Neutron rocket. Beyond fundamental strength, broader investor rotation into tariff-insulated aerospace names, and SpaceX-related political headwinds have turbocharged the rally. With sentiment now sky-high, the real question is: Can Rocket Lab keep climbing? Let’s break down the key drivers, risks and whether it’s still a buy. Rocket Lab has been feeding off investor excitement around the burgeoning space economy. Beyond offering reliable launch services for small satellites — significant in itself — Rocket Lab is deepening its moat by building an end-to-end space infrastructure platform. With its Electron rocket for small satellite launches, spacecraft platform, satellite components and on-orbit management solutions, Rocket Lab is targeting the full spectrum of the space value chain. This integrated approach strengthens its appeal for procuring large scale government and commercial contracts. Rocket Lab operates through two core segments: launch services and space systems. For the recent first quarter of 2025, space systems represented $87 million, or 70% of revenues, while launch services $35.6 million or 30%. Rocket Lab’s revenue has grown at a stellar pace of 7x, from $62.2 million in 2021 to $436.2 million in 2024, and is estimated to grow to $573.3 million in 2025, representing 31% year-on-year growth. The company is not yet profitable and cash flows are negative. Cash and equivalents at the end of Q1 2025 was $517 million. Backlog as of Q1 2025 was $1.067 billion with 60% attributed to the space systems segment and 40% to launch services. Commercial customers represented 54% of the backlog, while Government customers represented 46%. Rocket Lab expects about 56% of this backlog to be recognized within 12 months. Rocket Lab’s 800% stock surge reflects a blend of recent execution and future potential. Neutron is the main narrative investors are buying into now, even if Rocket Lab’s current fundamentals are still tied to Electron. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s next growth chapter is Neutron, its upcoming next-gen satellite launch vehicle that is central to its shift from small satellite missions to heavier payloads and high-value national security contracts. Neutron builds on the success of Electron, which has logged 3x more successful launches than all other American small launch providers combined over the past decade. If successful, Neutron could emerge as the first credible challenger to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in the medium-lift launch market, breaking into a near-monopoly space and significantly expanding Rocket Lab’s total addressable market. Investors already have a reason to be optimistic: The U.S. Space Force selected Rocket Lab to compete for high-priority, national security missions under its $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Rocket Lab’s launch vehicle for this program will be Neutron. Meanwhile, Electron, which is the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket, remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. The company successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket (as of June 28) and also set a new launch turnaround record, with the mission being the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours. In the first quarter of 2025, Electron achieved a 100% mission success rate, including an impressive, rapid turnaround of three launches in 13 days. This operational excellence continues to win trust and contracts for Electron missions. Rocket Lab sees commercial and government demand for 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test vehicle — HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) is seeing strong demand in the U.S., and beginning to gain traction internationally. Regular hypersonic flight tests are vital to advancing a nation’s defense capabilities, and HASTE is playing a central role. Both The U.S and The United Kingdom have picked HASTE to develop sovereign hypersonic technology for their multibillion dollar defense programs. Rocket Lab is also a key subcontractor under Kratos Defense’s flagship DoD program MACH‑TB 2.0, a $1.45 billion, five-year project to boost the U.S.’s hypersonic testing capabilities. With the latest launch award, Rocket Lab has now secured a total of seven HASTE missions for MACH-TB, underscoring its reliable launch cadence. Critically, Rocket Lab’s U.S.-based, non-China-linked ecosystem is a major asset in an era where national security, tech sovereignty and supply-chain resilience are top priorities. Although there is remarkable progress in the U.S.-China relations, geopolitical setups are never fully reliable and remain a wildcard. So, it is reassuring for investors to know that Rocket Lab is well aligned with Western defense and aerospace priorities. The company sees its current backlog for Electron and HASTE to support a higher average selling price for missions for through 2025 vs. 2024, powering continued gross margin expansion. Non GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 33.4%, above its guidance of 30% to 32%, and is seen expanding to 34% to 36% for the second quarter. On June 30, 2025, Rocket Lab joined the Russell 1000 Growth Index, prompting a wave of passive fund rebalancing worth $200 billion as index-tracking ETFs snapped up RKLB shares. The stock is up 30% from its June 30, closing price of $35.77. Whether Rocket Lab stock will continue to rise, hinges on a successful Neutron launch, and seamless execution of its end-to-end space platform strategy. So far, everything seems to be going right with Neutron. Neutron’s inclusion in the Pentagon’s $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch program is a validation of its strategic alignment with U.S. defense and space priorities, and a potential springboard into high-value defense missions. Neutron is being designed for reuse and frequent launches, which is a critical advancement in space tech that the Department of Defense (DOD) appears highly supportive of. As an endorsement for Neutron’s return-to-Earth capabilities, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has selected Neutron for a mission that supports its broader initiative to explore point-to-point cargo transportation using commercial launch vehicles. The mission will focus on returning payloads to Earth, and is scheduled to fly no earlier than 2026. Rocket Lab has signed a multi-launch agreement with an unnamed commercial satellite constellation operator, under which it will launch two dedicated missions on Neutron starting from mid-2026. The deal marks the start of what could become a larger collaboration, with Neutron likely to play a central role in launching the full constellation. All this interest in Neutron from Government and private customers, while it is still in the pre-launch phase - ups the ante significantly. Neutron has successfully completed its second stage qualification campaign — a major milestone that validates its design, operations and launch readiness for later this year. Rocket Lab said it conducted launch-like operations across the full stack, including flight software, hardware, avionics, and guidance, navigation and control systems. The stage was also proof-tested to more than 25% of its design load, including applying more than 1.3 million pounds of force and tension across the carbon composite structure. Neutron’s Stage 2 is a novel design compared to traditional rockets. Instead of being supported from the bottom, Stage 2 is suspended from the top of Stage 1’s tank, enabling a very lightweight structure. Retiring the risk associated with this novel configuration early on was a strategic priority. Stage 2’s structural design closely mirrors that of Stage 1, so this successful test campaign also helped de-risk critical elements of the first stage. Per Rocket Lab’s earnings call in May, Neutron Stage 2 is now going through final assembly and will be shipped to the launch site in the next few months in preparation for stage testing with the engine. Neutron’s Stage 1 upper module is also nearing completion. It integrates some of the most complex mechanical systems on the rocket, all of which are expected to perform seamlessly in testing. While most of Neutron is assembled at Rocket Lab’s facilities, the vehicle is shipped in segments to the Launch Complex 3 in Virginia, where it is integrated as a full rocket. The good news is construction at Launch Complex 3 is on schedule and nearing completion. The challenge is the launch site — the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia — has limited maritime infrastructure, and access through the shallow Sloop Gut channel is possible only during favorable tides. Rocket Lab is exploring a workaround with plans for dredging the channel so barges can deliver the segments more reliably. And yes, Rocket Lab still expects to launch Neutron in the second half of this year. Rocket Lab’s plan to build an end-to-end space company is key to its ability to win large-value contracts, so it is imperative that the plans succeed. A key part of this strategy is its pending acquisition of Mynaric, a German company specializing in laser-based satellite communication systems. The deal expands Rocket Lab’s footprint into Europe, and provides access to European programs and growth opportunities. The acquisition is a natural fit: Mynaric already supplies CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals to Rocket Lab under its $515 million Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to produce 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric is also involved in other SDA contracts and shares many clients with Rocket Lab spanning commercial constellation operators, prime contractors and defense and civil government agencies. Rocket Lab plans to scale production and improve efficiencies within Mynaric’s manufacturing process, bolstering its ability to deliver optical terminals on time and on budget. The move should position Rocket Lab to support a broader range of future SDA and defense initiatives. On the spacecraft side, Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft has already launched three missions for Varda Space Industries, supporting in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing and rapid reentry operations. The third mission for Varda was launched within 15 days after the successful return of Varda’s second mission, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s ability to maintain high-cadence launch and reentry space missions. Meanwhile, integration and testing for a fourth and final Pioneer spacecraft is in the works. New product launches like STARRAY, a plug and play, low-cost line of modular solar arrays to meet the power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions, are gaining traction with customers. Rocket Lab has also expanded its suite of Frontier satellite radios that are compatible with the industry’s most important global ground stations. The company has also launched the next generation versions of its popular MAX software packages for satellite guidance and control. Rocket Lab’s MAX software supported the successful Moon landing of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 earlier this year. The MAX software suite is also utilized in both NASA's CAPSTONE mission and DARPA's Blackjack program, as well as in Rocket Lab’s own Pioneer spacecraft for its Varda missions. So, the vertical integration plan appears to be proceeding smoothly. As Rocket Lab gears up to compete on a larger scale, comparisons with industry giant SpaceX are inevitable. SpaceX claims that it represents approximately 80% of the payload mass launched in orbit. Rocket Lab, by contrast, has focused on launching smaller satellites and payloads, but is aiming to facilitate bigger payloads with Neutron. Neutron will be a few tons below the payload capacity of Space X’s Falcon 9, but a Neutron launch is estimated to cost customers an estimated $50-55 million compared to the $67 million price tag for a Falcon 9 launch. On a per-kilogram basis, the cost is more-or-less the same for both. The company expects Neutron launch margins of approximately 50%, with the cost per Neutron launch estimated between $20 million and $25 million. Rocket Lab anticipates flying each reusable Neutron booster 10 to 20 times, comparable with the reuse cadence of a Falcon 9 booster. For long-term, growth-oriented investors, Rocket Lab offers strong upside, subject to achieving key milestones. Some catalysts include: Steep valuation vs. opportunity: Bloomberg recently reported that SpaceX is preparing for an insider share sale that would value the company at around $400 billion, which is nearly 20x bigger than Rocket Lab’s $22.5 billion market cap. Even with a modest narrowing of this enormous valuation gap, the potential upside for Rocket Lab stock could be substantial. Neutron could unlock a larger total addressable market: If Neutron succeeds in the medium lift segment, Rocket Lab could unlock a sizable, multi-billion total addressable market over the next decade, paving the path to profitability and leaving room for further stock upside. Minimal tariff exposure: Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets are made in New Zealand and launched from there. Very few of its Electron launches happen outside of New Zealand. So, the tariff exposure is minimal in its Electron launch business. Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business is intensively domestically sourced. Most manufacturing happens in the U.S., and what is not manufactured in the U.S. still entails high U.S. involvement. Rocket Lab has its manufacturing intensity largely aligned to geographies with minimal tariff exposure. This factor is also key to procuring defense contracts ruled by national security concerns. Increasing launch cadence, a clear path to government-aligned revenue streams, a bold yet calculated bet on the Neutron rocket, strategic vertical integration and a growing backlog give Rocket Lab a foundation that many other space stocks still lack. This suggests that RKLB’s 800% rally over the past year is not merely rooted in hype. That said, the stock’s current valuation, with much of the investor optimism already priced in, leaves little room for missteps. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. At current levels, the stock has already hit the upper range of analyst price targets, making it more of a Hold than a Buy for now.

Title: AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch: CEOs of America’s largest public companies made 285 times more than workers last year

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Starbucks’ coffee isn’t the only thing at the company that’s amped up. Its CEO, Brian Niccol, made a whopping 6,666 times more than the company’s typical employee last year, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual Executive Paywatch report, released Wednesday. It was the widest pay gap by far between the top executive and median worker among the nation’s 500 largest public companies listed in the report. Niccol, who took over the company’s helm last September, received nearly $98 million in compensation, compared to the typical Starbucks worker’s pay of less than $15,000, according to the report, which drew from corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Starbucks is but one example of the hefty pay gap between America’s corporate leaders and their workers, which grew even larger in 2024. CEOs at the largest public companies took home $18.9 million last year, or 285 times as much as the typical US worker’s paycheck of $49,500. That’s up from a ratio of 268 to 1 a year earlier, according to the AFL-CIO, a powerful federation of labor unions representing 15 million workers. The typical employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024, the report noted. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 from the prior year. It topped the prior peak of $18.3 million in 2021, though the ratio was 324 to 1 that year. The typical private sector worker’s raise last year was 3%, the AFL-CIO said, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. At Starbucks, the typical worker is a part-time barista in the US, the company said in its SEC filing. It noted that many of its employees work in part-time, flexible positions, which has the effect of lowering the compensation level of its median employee. Also, the calculation includes its global workforce of about 361,000 staffers, not just the roughly 210,000 US-based workers. Some staffers at the coffee retailer have formed a union, Starbucks Workers United, and have staged strikes at various locations in recent years. Among their demands is a wage increase. It’s “no wonder why the workers there at Starbucks are fighting to form a union with the Starbucks Workers Union to improve their pay and working conditions,” Fred Redmond, AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters. “And these numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality.” Starbucks did not immediately return a request for comment. In its report this year, the AFL-CIO highlighted that the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 will provide CEOs with far bigger tax breaks than workers. The average CEO will receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 from the permanent extension of the lower individual income tax rates, which were initially reduced in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the report found. That compares to a $765 tax break for the typical US worker. Unlike workers, salaries are not the largest component of CEOs’ compensation. Nearly half of the top executives’ total pay was restricted stock awards, and another $4 million were bonuses. The highest-paid CEO of an S&P 500 company was Patrick Smith of Axon Enterprise, which manufactures Tasers and other weapons for law enforcement and the military. He received a package of nearly $165 million. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Title: Is It Too Late To Buy MicroStrategy Stock Now After Soaring Over 100% In A Year?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/is-it-too-late-buy-microstrategy-mstr-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T18:30:37Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns ... More with your investment goals and risk capacity. MicroStrategy (MSTR) has become one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, delivering explosive returns that have left investors wondering whether they've missed the boat. With gains ranging from 58% to 176% over the past year, depending on the measurement period, and year-to-date performance soaring between 140-143%, the company's transformation from a traditional business intelligence firm into what Executive Chairman Michael Saylor calls a "Bitcoin Treasury Company" has created unprecedented volatility and opportunity. The question facing investors today isn't whether MicroStrategy has been successful – the numbers speak for themselves. Instead, the question is whether the stock's meteoric rise has created an unsustainable bubble or if there's still room for growth. With shares trading at $435.60 and a market capitalization approaching $122 billion, MicroStrategy now commands a valuation that dwarfs many established tech giants, making this decision all the more critical for potential investors. MicroStrategy's extraordinary performance is directly attributed to its bold bet on bitcoin, which has fundamentally altered the company's risk-return profile. The company now holds approximately 592,000 bitcoin worth roughly $70 billion, making it a leveraged play on cryptocurrency rather than a traditional software business. This massive bitcoin treasury has created a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.93 with bitcoin returns, meaning the stock moves almost in lockstep with the world's largest cryptocurrency. The stock's recent surge has been amplified by MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy, including a July 2025 purchase of 4,225 additional bitcoin that brought total holdings above 600,000 coins. Each bitcoin purchase serves as a catalyst, often triggering immediate stock price reactions from investors who view these moves as validation of the company's strategy and a sign of confidence in bitcoin's long-term prospects. Today's MicroStrategy operates as a hybrid entity that straddles two vastly different business models. While the company still maintains its original business intelligence and analytics software operations, these traditional revenue streams have been overshadowed by the massive bitcoin holdings that now define the company's value proposition. The original software business continues generating revenue, but investors largely ignore these fundamentals in favor of bitcoin exposure. The company's financial structure reflects this transformation, with a beta of approximately 3.7 indicating extreme volatility compared to the broader market. MicroStrategy has funded its bitcoin acquisitions through a combination of debt financing and equity issuance, with outstanding shares increasing 42% year-over-year to roughly 279 million. This aggressive capital-raising approach has enabled continued bitcoin accumulation but has also introduced significant dilution risk for existing shareholders. Determining MicroStrategy's fair value has become increasingly complex as traditional valuation metrics have become less reliable. The company trades at a significant premium to the net asset value of its bitcoin holdings, with a $122 billion market cap exceeding the $70 billion value of its cryptocurrency treasury by a substantial margin. Critics argue that this premium creates a dangerous bubble, particularly considering the company's lack of profitability, with earnings per share ranging from a negative $22.22 to negative $25. The valuation challenge is compounded by MicroStrategy's transformation into what's essentially a bitcoin investment vehicle with software revenue on the side. Investors are paying not just for bitcoin exposure but for Michael Saylor's ability to continue acquiring cryptocurrency through creative financing structures. Whether this premium is justified depends primarily on one's view of bitcoin's future trajectory and MicroStrategy's ability to execute effectively in leveraging traditional capital markets for cryptocurrency accumulation. Wall Street analysts remain divided on MicroStrategy's prospects, reflecting the broader uncertainty surrounding both the company's unique business model and the future of bitcoin. The stock's extreme volatility and unconventional structure make it challenging for traditional equity analysts to apply standard valuation frameworks. Many analysts focus more on bitcoin price targets and MicroStrategy's ability to continue its accumulation strategy rather than conventional metrics, such as revenue growth or profit margins. The upcoming July 31, 2025, earnings announcement, after the market close, represents a key catalyst that could provide clarity on the company's financial health and future bitcoin acquisition plans. Recent moves, including the issuance of $1 billion in preferred shares with 10% annual non-cumulative dividends, have been viewed as accretive by some analysts, who see it as a creative way to fund further bitcoin purchases while providing yield to income-focused investors. Supporters argue that MicroStrategy remains undervalued relative to its long-term potential, particularly if bitcoin continues its adoption trajectory among institutional investors and potentially governments. The company's first-mover advantage in corporate bitcoin adoption has created a unique position that would be difficult for competitors to replicate, especially given the regulatory uncertainties and board-level resistance typically found at most traditional corporations. The bull case also emphasizes MicroStrategy's innovative financing strategies, which have allowed the company to accumulate bitcoin without selling existing holdings. The recent preferred shares offering demonstrates management's creativity in accessing capital markets, potentially providing a sustainable model for continued accumulation. Technical indicators support this optimism, with the stock trading above all major moving averages and an RSI of approximately 58 suggesting room for further gains. Furthermore, MicroStrategy's massive bitcoin treasury creates inherent optionality value. As bitcoin gains wider acceptance or regulatory clarity improves, the company's holdings could benefit from multiple expansion beyond just cryptocurrency price appreciation. The leverage inherent in the stock structure means that modest gains in bitcoin translate into amplified returns for equity holders. The bear case centers on valuation concerns and the inherent risks associated with MicroStrategy's leverage-heavy strategy. Trading at a significant premium to its net bitcoin value while generating losses from operations suggests that the market has already priced in optimistic bitcoin scenarios. The company's 3.7 beta indicates that any bitcoin downturn will be magnified, potentially resulting in devastating losses for shareholders who purchase at current elevated levels. The bear case isn’t just about valuation or leverage—it’s about bubble risk. MicroStrategy trades at a substantial premium to its bitcoin holdings, reflecting aggressive bullish expectations that assume the crypto market continues to surge. However, the core argument against Bitcoin—that it’s a speculative bubble—has been raised by many, including Nobel laureates such as Robert Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, and others. Even a moderate 20% drop in bitcoin could wipe out billions and trigger margin calls, magnified by MSTR’s 3.7 beta, making losses far steeper. And as the bitcoin bubble bursts, MSTR’s share count may continue rising—its 42% YoY dilution could erode any remaining equity value. Structural concerns about dilution present another significant risk factor. The company's reliance on equity and debt issuance to fund bitcoin purchases means existing shareholders face continuous dilution risk. The 42% year-over-year increase in share count demonstrates how quickly this dilution can occur, potentially erasing gains even if bitcoin appreciates modestly. The concentration risk cannot be ignored either. Unlike diversified bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy offers no protection against company-specific risks, management missteps, or regulatory challenges that could specifically target corporate bitcoin holders. The stock's correlation with bitcoin means that investors gain cryptocurrency exposure, but with additional corporate and operational risks layered on top. Your decision should start with an honest assessment of your bitcoin outlook and risk tolerance. If you believe bitcoin will significantly outperform over your investment horizon, MicroStrategy's leverage structure could amplify those gains. However, this same leverage works in reverse during downturns, making the stock unsuitable for risk-averse investors or those with short-term investment horizons. Consider your existing cryptocurrency exposure as well. MicroStrategy functions as a leveraged bitcoin play, so investors already holding bitcoin or crypto-related assets may inadvertently be concentrating their portfolio risk. The stock's extreme volatility requires firm conviction and the ability to withstand potentially significant short-term losses. Time horizon plays a crucial role in this decision. Short-term traders face the challenge of timing both bitcoin moves and MicroStrategy's premium expansion or contraction. Long-term investors should focus on whether they believe the company's bitcoin accumulation strategy will create sustainable value over multiple market cycles, while also considering the ongoing dilution risk from future equity issuances. Bottom Line MicroStrategy represents one of the most unique investment opportunities in today's market – a leveraged play on bitcoin wrapped in a traditional corporate structure. While the stock's 100%+ annual gains suggest significant upside has been realized, the investment thesis remains intact for those bullish on bitcoin's long-term prospects. However, the premium valuation, dilution risks and extreme volatility make this investment suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and firm conviction in the future of cryptocurrency. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns with your investment goals and risk capacity.

With Project Flash, we receive a resource health event integrated into our alerting processes the moment an underlying node in Azure infrastructure is marked unallocatable, typically due to health degradation. Our infrastructure team then schedules a migration of the affected resource to healthy hardware at an optimal time. This ability to predictively avoid abrupt VM failures has reduced our VM interruption rate and improved the overall reliability of our investment platform. The Flash initiative has evolved into a robust, scalable monitoring framework designed to meet the diverse needs of modern infrastructure—whether you’re managing a handful of VMs or operating at massive scale. Built with reliability at its core, Flash empowers you to monitor what matters most, using the tools and telemetry that align with your architecture and operational model. Flash publishes VM availability states and resource health annotations for detailed failure attribution and downtime analysis. The guide below outlines your options so you can choose the right Flash monitoring solution for your scenario. Many customers have emphasized the need for user-friendly monitoring solutions that provide real-time, scalable access to compute resource availability data. This information is essential for triggering timely mitigation actions in response to availability changes. Designed to satisfy this critical need, the VM availability metric is well-suited for tracking trends, aggregating platform metrics (such as CPU and disk usage), and configuring precise threshold-based alerts. You can utilize this out-of-the-box VM availability metric in Azure Monitor. Now you can use the Context dimension to identify whether VM availability was influenced by Azure or user-orchestrated activity. This dimension indicates, during any disruption or when the metric drops to zero, whether the cause was platform-triggered or user-driven. It can assume values of Platform, Customer, or Unknown. The new dimension is also supported in Azure Monitor alert rules as part of the filtering process. Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub/Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns. Event Grid enables you to publish and subscribe to messages to support Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Through HTTP, Event Grid enables you to build event-driven solutions, where a publisher service (such as Project Flash) announces its system state changes (events) to subscriber applications. With the integration of Azure Monitor alerts as a new event handler, you can now receive low-latency notifications—such as VM availability changes and detailed annotations—via SMS, email, push notifications, and more. This combines Event Grid’s near real-time delivery with Azure Monitor’s direct alerting capabilities. To get started, simply follow the step-by-step instructions and begin receiving real-time alerts with Flash’s new offering. Looking ahead, we plan to broaden our focus to include scenarios such as inoperable top-of-rack switches, failures in accelerated networking, and new classes of hardware failure prediction. In addition, we aim to continue enhancing data quality and consistency across all Flash endpoints—enabling more accurate downtime attribution and deeper visibility into VM availability. For comprehensive monitoring of VM availability—including scenarios such as routine maintenance, live migration, service healing, and degradation—we recommend leveraging both Flash Health events and Scheduled Events (SE). For upcoming updates on the Flash initiative, we encourage you to follow the advancing reliability series! The future of AI starts here. Envision your next great AI app with the latest technologies.

Title: Amazon snaps up AI wearables company Bee

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said the deal, for an undisclosed amount, has yet to close. Amazon has confirmed that it is acquiring AI wearables company Bee. The news was first revealed via Bee’s website and a social media post from Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, is signed but hasn’t closed, an Amazon spokesperson said by email. The company sells a wristband that records, transcribes and provides feedback on conversations for about $50; a subscription service is also planned. Those plans are likely to gain steam under Amazon’s ownership. Subscriptions as sources of recurring revenue have long been a focus of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy; in its most recent quarter, the company’s subscription revenue rose 9% to $11.7 billion. In May, Jassy touted Alexa+, the agentic AI upgrade of the company’s Alexa virtual assistant, and told analysts that the company is investing in AI to further customer service innovations. All Bee employees received offers to join Amazon, though the company spokesperson declined to provide numbers. Last month, Jassy warned employees that AI was likely to lead to workforce cuts. This year Amazon announced layoffs in its North America retail and bookselling businesses.

Title: The DORKs are popular this week. Here's the new class of meme stocks retail traders are pumping to the moon.

Time Published: 2025-07-23T15:18:23Z
Full Content:
The DORKs are popular this week. With stocks at record highs, there's a new class of meme stocks that's grabbed the attention of retail traders. Absent are the OG meme names GameStop and AMC. Those early favorites have been replaced by another group. The DORKs—an acronym being thrown around by bullish traders to refer to the ticker symbols of Krispy Kreme, Opendoor, Rocket Lab, and Kohl's—are spiking in the last few days, with the burst of enthusiasm sparked by a stunning rally in Opendoor stock that's mostly cooled off even as the rest of the group surges. It's looking similar to 2021, when everything from crypto to pandemic-era blank check firms to highly-shorted companies with weak financials were getting pushed to dizzying heights. And with recent legislation proposing to loosen day trading restrictions by lowering the minimum margin account threshold, there's never been a more retail-friendly time in the markets. But there are differences, too, between today's rally and the pandemic-era frenzy. "Today's surge is powered by advances in trading technology, wider use of leverage, and the rapid expansion of the options market. Confidence among retail traders is notably higher, fueled in part by recent gains in crypto markets," Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, said. "While this activity reflects rising risk appetite, it remains isolated and has yet to challenge the broader market's calm and steady tone." Taking a page from Warren Buffett's book, investors are getting greedy, which also means extra caution may be warranted. Tony DeSpirito, head of US fundamental equities at BlackRock, is sensing some pockets of froth in the market as sentiment continues to rise and meme stocks surge. In particular, stocks with high multiples but low growth are concerning to DeSpirito. "Meme stocks are the epitome of greed," DeSpirito told Business Insider. "If I'm advising an individual, I'd tell them to stay away from the meme stocks and get the stocks that actually have good cash flow, good earnings, etc." Here's what's been moving in the meme stock world. Prior to last week, Opendoor was an unloved penny stock on the verge of delisting from the Nasdaq. After hedge fund manager Eric Jackson shouted out the stock on X and gave it a hefty $82 price target, enthusiasm for Opendoor surged, activating the retail trader cohort who quickly went all-in. The stock has rallied over 440% in the last month alone, going from under a dollar to $2.88, even hitting $4.71 briefly at one point on Monday. The rally has stalled in recent days, with the shares down as much as 28% on Wednesday. The stock is still up 310% in the last month. Kohl's stock jumped 38% on Tuesday, not on the heels of corporate news or earnings, but rather r/WallStreetBets chatter. Retail traders identified a short interest of nearly half of the company's float, making the stock a perfect candidate for a short squeeze. The frenzy caused trading in Kohl's shares to be temporarily paused during Tuesday's session. The doughnut chain Krispy Kreme surged 28% on Tuesday. The stock started 2025 trading at nearly $10 and proceeded to slide downwards in the following months after the company reported disappointing earnings—until this week. The stock soared again on Wednesday, up as much as 39%before paring gains. Krispy Kreme also has a significant short interest level of 33%, making it another target for Reddit short squeezers. Rocket Lab stock has surged amid increased retail interest in space technology. The company provides end-to-end space services and is a rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The stock has been a Wall Street Bets favorite for many months now. Rocket Lab has surged nearly 50% in the last month and is up nearly 100% year-to-date, bolstered by news of recent government contracts and scheduled launches. The company's short interest comprises 13% of its float. Digital camera producer GoPro was also swept up in the meme-stock craze. In its heyday back in 2015, the stock traded at $67. A big influx of retail volume has propelled the stock from under a dollar to above $2 immediately upon Wednesday's open. The stock was up as much as 72% on Wednesday before paring the gain to around 40%. Nearly 10% of GoPro's float is shorted. Jump to

Δ The collaboration will see BNY use Goldman Sachs’ blockchain technology to maintain a record of customers’ ownership of select money market funds (MMFs). The companies said in a Wednesday (July 23) press release that the project is “a significant step towards enhancing the utility and transferability of existing MMF shares.” It’s also the first time that fund managers in the United States have enabled subscription for shares of their MMFs via BNY’s LiquidityDirect and Digital Asset platforms, “the corresponding value of which will be represented through mirrored record tokenization utilizing GS DAP,” Goldman Sachs’ blockchain-based platform, per the release. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are all participating in the launch, the release said. “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” Laide Majiyagbe, global head of liquidity, financing and collateral at BNY, said in the release. “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative.” Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, said in the release that using tokens representing the value of shares of MMFs on GS DAP “would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future.” BNY will continue to maintain the official books, records, and settlements for the funds within approved guidelines while also enabling mirror tokens on GS DAP to create future opportunities, according to the release. Meanwhile, tokenization is transforming the way consumers and merchants think about payment security, Valeri Vanourek, vice president of digital products at Discover® Network, told PYMNTS this month. “The benefits of tokenization haven’t changed,” Vanourek said. “A streamlined checkout process, additional protection as part of the transaction, the account updates in the case of a cardholder’s primary account number being lost or stolen or needing to be replaced, all of those result in a frictionless and secure transaction.” What has changed is that companies that choose to invest in tokenization for their payment architecture could be best placed to flourish in the next wave of digital commerce.

Jul 23, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Currency exchange fluctuations and tariffs force Nokia to issue a profits warning for the full year; AT&T is to pump billions more into its fibre access network infrastructure as it celebrates massive tax savings from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; Comcast and Charter have hooked up with T-Mobile US, and not existing MVNO partner Verizon, for B2B mobile services; and much more! Nokia’s share price slumped by 8.5% to €3.76 during Wednesday trading on the Helsinki stock exchange after the vendor issued a profit warning late on Tuesday, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. While the vendor says its “underlying business performed as expected” during the first six months of the year, the foreign exchange shifts and the impact of trade tariffs have forced the company to lower its operating profit outlook for the full year to €1.6bn-2.1bn from its previous outlook of €1.9bn-€2.4bn), a difference of €300m. The main impact has come from the change in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar: When Nokia made its initial full year calculations in January, the €/$ exchange rate was 1.04, but its new calculation is based on a rate of 1.17. That shift has had a €230m negative impact on its operating profit projection, while the “tariff landscape” is expected to have a negative impact this year of between €50m and €80m. Nokia is set to publish its second quarter 2025 results during the morning of 24 July but ahead of that publication it noted that it expects to report revenues of €4.55bn and an operating profit of €300m. Nokia, of course, won’t be alone in taking this kind of hit: Other European vendors that do a lot of business in the US will also be impacted by the same “headwinds”, especially if the US does impose 30% tariffs on EU goods from 1 August, as has been threatened. AT&T expects to benefit from cash tax savings worth between $6.5bn and $8bn during the 2025-2027 period, relative to the financial guidance it provided at its 2024 investor day, due to the impact of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The telco expects savings of $1.5bn-$2bn this year, followed by $2.5bn-$3bn in 2026 and again in 2027. The news came as the operator reported its second quarter financial results. AT&T says it plans to invest $3.5bn of those expected savings into its network infrastructure to “accelerate its fibre internet build-out to a pace of 4 million locations per year, a run-rate it expects to achieve by the end of 2026.” The telco added: “As a result of this increased pace of organic fibre deployment, AT&T expects that by the end of 2030 it will reach approximately 50 million customer locations with its in-region fibre network,” and more than 60 million fibre locations once it includes: the Lumen Technologies Mass Markets fibre broadband network assets it has agreed to acquire for $5.75bn (and which it plans to expand); its Gigapower joint venture with Blackrock; and agreements with open access fibre broadband network providers. As for the rest of the savings, AT&T plans to pump $1.5bn into its employee pension plan by the end of 2026 and use the remaining savings for “financial flexibility to support additional strategic investments, incremental capital returns and debt repayment, among other potential uses.” For the second quarter, AT&T reported communications services revenues of $29.7bn, up by 3.9% year on year, and communications services operating profits of $7.07bn, up by 0.9%. US cable operator giants Comcast and Charter Communications have struck a joint (and exclusive) MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal with T-Mobile US to offer mobile services to their enterprise customers. Mobile services will be offered by Charter and Comcast to US businesses under the Spectrum Mobile for Business and Comcast Business Mobile brands, respectively, noted T-Mobile US in this announcement. Edward Zimmermann, president of Comcast Business, stated: “Comcast Business delivers advanced, converged solutions to business customers by uniting the scale of our nationwide WiFi network, gig-plus speeds, and the integration of top-tier 5G mobile capabilities. Our capital-light partnership with T-Mobile further strengthens our growth strategy in wireless for business customers and provides them exceptional value.” Danny Bowman, executive VP for Product at Charter Communications, added: “Spectrum Mobile for Business offers a truly converged connectivity experience, combining gig-powered internet and superior WiFi service with a premium 5G mobile network. This partnership with T-Mobile will allow us to rapidly and cost-effectively bring even more value to our Spectrum Mobile business customers.” The deal is great news for the wholesale unit of T-Mobile US, which is not shy in telling the world how advanced its 5G network is, but something of a blow to Verizon, which already provides MVNO services to Comcast and Charter for their consumer mobile service offerings – Xfinity Mobile (8.1 million customers) and Spectrum Mobile (10.4 million customers), respectively. The cable companies have stressed that their “existing long-term MVNO partnership will continue to support residential and current business customers”. That’s a small crumb of comfort for Verizon, which will now face even fiercer competition in the enterprise mobile services space from the cable giants. Of course, AT&T and T-Mobile US will also face similar competitive pressure in the B2B market, but at least T-Mobile US will be reaping the rewards of the MVNO fees from Comcast and Charter. Research firm Omdia has taken a look at what Asia’s cloud service providers – including SK Telecom and China’s cloud providers such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent – are doing in order to meet the rising demand for AI inference from the region’s enterprise sector. By examining which GPUs (graphics processing units), AI accelerators and AI-optimised CPUs (central processing units) these companies have deployed, and the current status of their own AI models and custom chip projects, as well as their AI service and pricing plans, it has come up with an interesting take on the sector. “Despite heavy stockpiling of Nvidia H800 and H20 GPUs during 2024 and early 2025, prior to the imposition of US export controls, these high-performance chips are difficult to find in Chinese cloud services, suggesting they are primarily used for the hyperscalers’ own model development projects,” noted Omdia in this announcement. At the same time, “there are relatively few options that use any of the Chinese AI chip projects; exceptions include Baidu’s on-premises cloud products and some Huawei Cloud services, although they remain limited,” it added. Omdia principal analyst Alexander Harrowell noted: “The real triumph in Chinese semiconductors has been CPUs rather than accelerators. Chinese Arm-based CPUs are clearly in production at scale and are usually optimised for parallel workloads in a way like Amazon Web Services’ Graviton series. Products such as Alibaba’s YiTian 710 offer an economically attractive solution for serving the current generation of small AI models such as Alibaba Qwen3 in the enterprise, where the user base is relatively small and workload diversity is high,” he added. Where “modern GPUs” are deployed, “the strongest offering Omdia found was the GPU-as-a-service product SK Telecom is building in partnership with Lambda Labs,” the research firm noted. Philippines operator Globe Telecom has committed to power 3,000 cell sites in Metro Manila and Calabarzon with 100% renewable power in a move that will lead to the consumption of 80 million kWh of clean electricity and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 5.5 million kilograms, reports Southeast Asia Infrastructure. Research firm Mobile Experts has taken a broad look at the impact of AI on mobile networks and concluded that “AI assistants and AR [augmented reality] will strain the 5G network, but AI-for-RAN optimization [the use of AI to enhance the performance and efficiency of radio access networks] will create more capacity than consumer applications will use, at least through 2030. The wild card is in automated use of AI for video analysis, in automotive, drone, and industrial applications.” Joe Madden, principal analyst at Mobile Experts, stated: "New applications are coming to your smartphone, taking advantage of on-device AI processing capability. We have been able to identify which apps will run on your phone, and which ones will require network connectivity. The frame rates, resolution, and persistence of video inputs will have a profound impact on the 5G network," added Madden. – The staff, TelecomTV Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 23, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Get Free Sample Report of the Hedge Fund Market: https://www.snsinsider.com/sample-request/6889 Key Hedge Fund Companies Profiled in the Report: Hedge Fund Market Report Scope Segment Analysis By Type: Offshore Dominates, Fund of Funds Sees Fastest Growth Offshore hedge funds dominated the market in 2024 and accounted for 46% of revenue share, as they offer tax benefits, looser regulations, and are attractive to institutional investors outside of the US looking to maximize returns through multi-jurisdictional strategies. These funds typically operate from a jurisdiction such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, offering the practical advantages of lower operating costs and privacy, appealing to both high-net-worth individuals and institutions. The Fund of Funds segment is expected to register the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, as it allows for diversification of risk and access to a wide variety of investments. Such funds enable investors to access multiple hedge strategies in one vehicle, mitigating idiosyncratic manager risk. This model is attractive to new investors and institutions seeking balanced exposure and lowering compliance overhead, increasing its adoption rate, particularly across the Asia-Pacific and European markets. By Strategy: Long/Short Equity Dominates, Global Macro Grows Fastest Long/short equity segment dominated the market in 2024 and accounted for a significant revenue share. Its core allure is its capability to produce alpha during upswings and downturns alike. Fund managers can mitigate risk while still maximizing for absolute returns by going long on cheap stocks and short on expensive ones. Such flexibility across volatile and stable economic cycles makes it appealing and secures its position as one of the leaders among hedge strategies. The Global Macro strategies segment is witnessing the fastest CAGR, driven by geopolitical unrest, inflation fluctuations, and changing interest rate environments. These macroeconomic cross-currency/comodity and sovereign debt arb strategies represent an agile toolbox while capitalizing on global inefficiencies.

By Region: North America Leads, Asia-Pacific Surges Forward North America dominated the hedge fund market in 2024 and accounted for 40% of revenue share, supported by its deep capital markets, concentration of institutional investors, and the maturity of its regulatory environment. Earlier, Hedge strategies, fintech integration, and High-frequency trading technologies will continue to call the U.S. home, and thus leadership will be maintained through 2032. Asia-Pacific is registering the fastest CAGR, owing to the rise in the number of rich populations, liberalizing financial regulations, and growing penetration of fintechs.

Title: Buy AMZN Stock At $230?

Time Published: 2025-07-23T13:05:24Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has increased by 4% this year, trailing the S&P 500’s 7% growth slightly. This modest underperformance primarily results from a mix of valuation apprehensions and the company's significant investment cycle. Having invested $53 billion into capital expenditures in 2023 and $83 billion in 2024, Amazon is now forecasting a substantial $100 billion expenditure this year, mainly aimed at enhancing its AI capabilities. While these considerable investments may affect short-term profitability, they are essential for Amazon's long-term growth and competitive advantage. At present, with AMZN trading at $230, the crucial question for investors is straightforward: should you buy, sell, or hold? We believe there is further upside potential for AMZN stock from its current levels. Our conclusion is based on an analysis of AMZN’s current valuation in relation to its recent operational performance and its current and historical financial status. Our thorough evaluation of Amazon.com across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates a company with robust operational performance and a solid financial base, as elaborated further below. However, if you are looking for upside potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Additionally, see – Block Inc.: What’s Happening With XYZ Stock? Based on what is paid per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock appears costly in comparison to the broader market. Amazon.com’s Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. The profit margins of Amazon.com are lower than those of most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Amazon.com’s balance sheet appears robust. AMZN stock has experienced an effect that was marginally better than the S&P 500 benchmark during one of the two recent downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash provides a detailed analysis of the stock's performance during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Amazon.com’s performance across the metrics outlined above is as follows: On the whole, Amazon.com has shown strong performance across key indicators. From a price-to-sales (P/S) standpoint, a ratio of 3.6 times trailing revenues, combined with low double-digit revenue growth, seems reasonable to us. While the current price-to-earnings ratio for AMZN may seem slightly elevated, we expect a more substantial growth trajectory in the upcoming years. This is largely due to the increasing impact of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its more profitable cloud computing segment, on the total revenue mix. Related – Amazon Stock: Path To 2x Growth. Considering these aspects, we believe there is still significant upside potential for AMZN stock from its current position. Naturally, our evaluation might be incorrect. Investors may be reluctant to assign a higher valuation multiple, especially given Amazon's considerable capital expenses, increasing competition, and slower-than-anticipated growth in certain business segments. However, if you are working with a 3-5 year investment horizon, AMZN stock could be a beneficial addition to your investment portfolio. While it appears there is further upside to AMZN stock, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a responsive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Buy Or Sell MSFT Stock At $510?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has excelled this year, with its stock climbing over 20%. This notably exceeds the broader market performance, as the S&P 500 is up 7%, and competitors like Amazon have achieved just a 5% increase, while Google has gained less than 1%. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to strong cloud expansion—Azure revenue alone surged 33% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025—and its ongoing advances in AI integration. Microsoft’s solid position in the emerging AI boom has undoubtedly been a significant factor contributing to investor trust. However, at the current price of $510, is there still potential for growth? We believe there is. We arrived at this conclusion by evaluating MSFT stock’s current valuation against its operating performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Microsoft, considering essential factors such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates a company with robust operating performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. That being said, if you're looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 with returns surpassing 91% since its inception. On a separate note, is PepsiCo stock still appealing? See What’s Happening With PepsiCo Stock? When considering what you pay for each dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears costly relative to the wider market. Microsoft's Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft's profit margins significantly exceed those of most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft's balance sheet appears very robust. MSFT stock has demonstrated a performance slightly better than the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard – How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash – provides an in-depth analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft's performance across the aforementioned parameters can be summarized as follows: In summary, Microsoft stock has significantly excelled across all critical parameters, which contributes to its premium valuation. Currently priced at $510, the stock stands at 39 times its trailing earnings, marking a slight increase from its four-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 35. Nonetheless, we contend that this premium is warranted, and there exists the possibility for further growth. This optimism is fueled by impressive sales growth in Azure and improved profitability, as demonstrated by Microsoft’s operating margin expanding from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now. Related – The Bull Case For Microsoft’s Next 2x Rally. Of course, our evaluation may be incorrect, and investors might hesitate to pay an even higher premium for MSFT stock considering its already elevated valuation and other risks, such as the recent security breach. Nevertheless, if you have confidence that AI growth will persist, and you possess a 3-5 year investment perspective, Microsoft is likely to be a successful stock. Not particularly fond of the volatile nature of MSFT stock? Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio; it boasts a collection of 30 stocks and has a strong track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns while incurring less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Business FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the the company logo for Goldman Sachs on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Goldman Sachs and BNY have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance. Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday. The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the companies participating in the initial rollout.

Due to its 71.6% monthly rise, per CoinGecko, XRP has surpassed drinks company PepsiCo, telecommunications firm AT&T, and taxi app Uber. Ethereum, by comparison, is the 29th largest asset, ahead of the likes of retail company Cotco and medical firm Johnson & Johnson. As for Bitcoin, it currently sits as the 6th largest asset behind Amazon and ahead of Google's creator, Alphabet. However, one expert warns against treating the market capitalization of a public company and a cryptocurrency as the same thing. "It's important that the two concepts are not treated the same," Matej Janež, Head of Partnerships at crypto privacy firm Oasis, told Decrypt. "A public company's market cap counts shares that confer a legal claim on earnings and assets. A crypto market cap is the price multiplied by the circulating token count. Both numbers can reveal speculative appetite, but only one comes with enforceable rights to dividends and residual assets." XRP set a new all-time high earlier this month for the first time in seven years. It came following a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that Ripple and two of its executives had participated in the sale of unregistered securities through XRP. The worst of the legal battle appears to be behind the project as President Trump’s pro-crypto administration begins to ease regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse even claimed the battle was over in March, despite some details of the lawsuit—a $125 million penalty—still lingering. Since Trump secured re-election in November 2024, XRP has surged 585.8% from $0.503 to $3.44. That move has seen the cryptocurrency surpass the likes of investment titan BlackRock, aircraft creator Boeing, and sporting giant Nike. “PesiCo, Uber, BlackRock, Google, Uber will remain in the dust because of XRP. [It] will continue to grow and grow because it has real value,” MackAttackXRP, a pseudonymous member of the XRP Army, an avid supporters group, told Decrypt. “XRP is on its way to the top ten. And it might happen sooner than many might think.” For XRP to climb into the top 10, the cryptocurrency would need to jump more than 735% in value—assuming no other assets increase or decrease in value. MackAttackXRP and other XRP Army troopers argue that XRP will become the standard for transactions across the globe, replacing the traditional banking system, because of its low fees and fast processing speeds. Breaking into the top 10 remains some distance away for XRP, however. Looking to a more achievable goal, XRP needs to rise just 5% to surpass fast-food behemoth McDonald’s. Such a move would also see it surpass oil company Shell and banking firm American Express.

Share this article Goldman Sachs and BNY are launching a new platform that allows institutional clients to invest in tokenized money market funds, CNBC reported Wednesday, and it already has backing from titans like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Federated Hermes. Under the initiative, BNY clients, such as hedge funds, pensions, and corporate treasurers, will gain access to tokenized fund share classes recorded directly on Goldman’s private blockchain. Tokenized money market shares promise an alternative to stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins, money market funds generate real returns, making them a compelling on-chain instrument for parking idle capital with low risk and high liquidity. In March 2024, Goldman Sachs, BNY, and other financial institutions participated in a network test on Digital Asset’s Canton Network to facilitate seamless transactions and settlements of tokenized assets. The pilot involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, and three exchanges, demonstrating the potential of enterprise blockchain to reduce risks, optimize capital, and enable more efficient financial processes.

Title: Overnight sensation Thomas Clarkson taking advantage of surprise Lions call-up

Full Content:
If ever there was a five-year overnight sensation it is assuredly Thomas Clarkson. He made his Leinster debut in August 2020 but went into this campaign with less than 20 starts under his belt and as his province’s third choice tighthead. Yet there he was on Tuesday night in the Marvel Stadium mixed zone after the 24-19 win over the Pasifika XV, a bona fide British & Irish Lion. No one seemed more incredulous as well as delighted than the 25-year-old himself, for he freely admitted he wouldn’t have thought all of this was possible when he was named as one of the additional, or development, players to train with Ireland’s squad last November, before making his debut against Argentina off the bench, backing it up against Fiji, and then playing in four Six Nations games, starting against Wales. Clarkson is eligible for Italy on his mother’s side and also revealed he was approached by Italy at the start of last season. “I wasn’t even really expecting to play in that. So, to get a cap I was delighted. “The Six Nations; I was happy enough with how it went. I wouldn’t have said I set the world alight or anything. So, to then play well for Leinster at the end of the season and come in here, it’s pretty mad.” As recently as January 2025, Clarkson was playing an AIL Division 1B game for Blackrock. “I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I’ve been waiting a long time. So, the fact that when it has come, it’s all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really.” It’s been a Lions tour of an unprecedented and, frankly, unexpected bounty for Irish tightheads, three of them making the tour. And two of whom are inextricably linked. Had it not been for the calf and hamstring issues which restricted Tadhg Furlong to just seven games for Leinster and one for Ireland, Clarkson would never have had the opportunities that came for province and country. Even so, after adding three more Champions Cup pool games to his one outing before this season, Clarkson didn’t make the Leinster 23 in their European knockout games. But with Furlong sidelined again, Leo Cullen started Clarkson in their round 18 game against Glasgow. “It all kind of just clicked and then kept that momentum going. That was the first game when I thought: ‘That was a proper performance’.” David Humphreys has now lifted his moratorium on the provinces signing props from abroad and although Furlong’s injury woes have been a factor, Clarkson’s own account of his growth this season shows how Irish players can learn from overseas acquisitions like Rabah Slimani. “I’ve been kind of understudy to Tadhg for a good few years now. He’s consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. It’s been unbelievable being there, just around him. “Rabah’s come in and probably offered something a bit different, where he’s 100 per cent scrum. Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it, whereas Rabah, when you’re scrumming against him in training, it’s all or nothing against him. It’s been a different kind of experience with him, but I’ve felt I’ve come out the other end well.” Clarkson retained his starting place at tighthead in the URC quarter-final, semi-final and final wins, before playing against Georgia and Portugal. That Saturday night in Lisbon, he thought his breakthrough season was done until he received a text from Andy Farrell at 3am. “We were on a night out; I had to go home straight away. But yeah, some text to get. It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said: ‘Oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [O’Connell] rang me and was like: ‘Ring him right now’. So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it.” Sadly, social media can be a nasty world, and on foot of the backlash to him and Jamie Osborne being called up, Clarkson opted to ignore it. “I feel like the last few weeks in Leinster, before the semi-final, was fairly negative. I just tried to use that as a bit of motivation. I knew, just because Jamie got called in right before me, there was a bit of backlash to that. So, I knew it was going to be even more when I got the nod. So yeah, I just tried to stay away from it.” “It was a bit of a shock at the start, to be honest. You grow up using social media. It was hard to step away from it. But I just had to get rid of a lot of that.” Clarkson admits that linking up with the Lions at short notice was a good deal easier for him than the late Scottish call-ups given his familiarity with so many players and coaches, not least Andy Farrell and John Fogarty. On Tuesday morning Fogarty told Clarkson that his form for Leinster merited his call-up and encouraged him to continue that form into the match that night, so building up his confidence. “I felt like I was chasing my tail a little bit, but happy enough with the scrum and I made a few tackles. It was a good start.” To make Clarkson’s landmark night even better, his father Finbarr made it out in time for Tuesday’s match. “I think he knew if he was going to be here for any game, it would be this game. So yeah, he legged it down.” All the while in the mixed zone, he still had his Lions cap in his grasp, which had been given to him by Ieuen Evans. “It’s crazy, 886,” he says, of his number in Lions’ playing history. “I didn’t even know they did caps if you don’t play in the Test.” He’s a Lion now all right.

Δ Or the June announcement that Siri’s AI-powered reboot, already a year overdue, won’t arrive until mid-2026. Two years after Apple Intelligence’s public debut landed with a thud. Or maybe it’s the nine-figure AI talent drain to Meta and the billions of dollars in acquisitions by Google happening just as investors digest reports that Apple has spent $10 billion chasing AI, with $5 billion more burned annually across 30 acquisitions. Apple’s investors are now nervous. They should be. Apple Intelligence doesn’t appear in any serious public Gen AI rankings. It lags behind even X.ai’s Grok. That’s not a public relations problem. It’s a strategic misstep. Maybe even a crater-sized hole that could prove Apple’s fatal flaw. Apple is 2025’s worst-performing Big Tech stock, down almost 15% to date. Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta are all up. Even Amazon and Alphabet are outperforming. Only Tesla has done worse. Maybe investors didn’t take Gen AI, and more recently, agent-driven workflows, as seriously before. Was Gen AI really all that transformative? Would people and businesses really care? The market response is yes, yes and without a doubt, yes. They and Apple are finding that AI is a technological opportunity that rewards speed. Apple hasn’t left the starting blocks. Its competitors are accelerating, iterating and launching new GenAI tools and agents across products and platforms. Apple is betting it can catch up by wiring OpenAI into Siri. A year from now. Losing the AI Race Apple’s AI failures are just one of several existential threats now facing this iconic brand. And, the signs of Apple’s structural weakness were clear long before AI became an investor and market focus. Back in October 2024, when Apple Pay turned ten, I wrote about the fault lines forming beneath Apple’s biggest business pillars. Those cracks are wider now. The combined pressures now seem existential. Tensions with China Read the Report: Apple Pay at 10 Start with China. Apple’s share of smartphone shipments is stuck at 13.9%, in fifth behind domestic brands. Its installed base is flat at 23% to 24%. Q2 saw a slight bump driven by subsidies. Geopolitical risk makes that market even more volatile. A crackdown from Beijing on American tech companies could force Apple to exit. A Taiwan conflict could imperil chip supply. At the same time, Apple faces tariff threats from both the U.S. and China. That leaves Tim Cook navigating a shrinking margin in Apple’s most important growth market while sweating about a fragile supply chain. Lost App Store Revenue Then there’s the App Store. Apple’s $20 billion profit engine, mostly fueled by in-app purchases, now has a big blinking asterisk next to it. The Epic ruling puts this once untouchable revenue stream at risk and gives developers legitimate ways to avoid paying the Apple commission. Spotify and Netflix and Amazon already use their newfound right to steer users off-platform to sign up. Stripe has published a playbook to show developers how which suggests a giant sucking sound may follow. Apple’s grip on its ecosystem profits is slipping. The $20 billion Apple receives from Google for default Safari search is also in jeopardy. The DOJ antitrust case could break that deal. And even if it survives, search is shifting to AI-driven chat and apps. The value of default placement will erode, taking Apple’s search revenue with it. Lost Search Revenue That’s why Apple is pinning so much hope on OpenAI. The thesis: if Siri gets smarter, users will stay loyal. The App Store keeps humming. The moat deepens. The stock price will reflect forward progress. Users are getting impatient waiting for Siri to get smarter. And OpenAI is also busy building its own future, not Apple’s, and doing it with one of the brains behind the design of the iPhone. OpenAI and Jony Ive are building a GenAI-native OS and device. It’s always on. Contextual. Commerce-ready with integration into ChatGPT with Shopify. This new experience is scheduled to launch in June of 2026. Timeline sound familiar? The risk to Apple isn’t theoretical. If the new OpenAI OS and connected device works as advertised, the iPhone becomes an accessory. No longer the consumer’s primary digital front door. Just another handset where real AI experiences happen independent of the handset. The iPhone becomes a commodity. Apple is facing the same risk from Google and Android. With a global market share of roughly 74% and an already-embedded AI in the Android OS, Pixel 9 has, and Pixel 10 will ship with, Gemini. Users can speak, search, transact and navigate with native AI experience and with a phone that consumers can buy now. Apple can’t match that today. The risk is how many consumers will keep waiting around for Apple to deliver. It’s a massive pain to switch from iOS to Android devices, and most people don’t. Getting an AI-powered Android device just may be enough for people to dump their iPhones. Especially if the Open AI/Jony Ive device is way cooler. Consumers will, for the first time, have a plausible choice. Apple has already seen some of that handwriting on the wall. Tim Cook warned that 2025 iPhone sales will slow, possibly falling below 2024 levels. That would mean a steady overall decline since 2021. In that year, Apple sold 242 million phones, and then saw that number slip to 232.1M in 2024. iPhone handset sales still generate 51.4% of Apple’s revenue, so selling a lot of them matters. Fewer iPhone sales means less Services revenue and a declining user base to monetize over the long term. This is why Apple tried to buy Perplexity. Apple hoped Perplexity could become something more than a commercial deal with a GenAI-native search platform with momentum, clear user growth and a model better suited to a world of prompt-based, conversational engagement. It was a way to get to market fast with a great product and a built-in team of otherwise scarce-as-hen’s-teeth native GenAI/agentic AI experts. Perplexity would have been the engine for a new, native AI-powered Apple commerce experience. One Apple could own and control. The same playbook that turned iPods into a new way to access music, iPhones into access to the digital world and the NFC chip into a mobile wallet called Apple Pay. Bolstered by the distribution from Apple’s 1.56 billion iPhones in the market. But Apple needed Perplexity more than Perplexity needed Apple. Perplexity denied having any M&A conversations. Whether they did or plan to, the right answer should be “thanks, but no thanks.” Perplexity hit an $18B valuation in less than two years’ time. It’s created a native commerce capability that is the baseline for agentic commerce connected to millions of merchants through firmly. It’s working with phone operators to install its Comet browser on phones. Sure, it could flame out. But given what it touches and could disrupt, it could also become a trillion-dollar company. It’s likely that Apple would have used the acquisition more of an insurance policy, a way to patch the hole left by a decade of underwhelming AI investments. What Apple needed, and still does, is a foundation and a clear vision for GenAI and agentic experiences. As for Perplexity, I might recommend moving up the West Coast and alphabet to Seattle and Amazon. Today, we find an iconic brand that’s wobbling and facing threats from all sides. So, what are Apple’s options? Here are a few commission-free ideas. AI Tariffs AI Tariffs. Tim Cook could channel his inner President Trump and impose an AI tariff on all native AI apps, maybe even all apps with embedded AI-native experiences, in the App Store. It could be a (by current standards) small tax of something like 3-5%. Enough to make hay while the AI sun shines, but not so much that app developers would throw up, particularly in the U.S. where Apple has a 58% share of the handset market. A Meta JV. Apple could ditch OpenAI and do a JV with Meta. It might not be as crazy as it sounds. Meta has made it clear that it will pay the big bucks to attract the best AI talent in the market. Experts with deep knowledge are scarce, and getting and keeping them means using compensation as the AI golden handcuff. Apple has lost some of its best talent to others, including Meta. Joint Venture with Meta Meta has a talent pool, and a portfolio of apps in which to embed a native, embedded AI experience. It doesn’t have a device. All of its serious AI competitors do. A JV with Apple to make Llama the AI-OS for Apple, in exchange for distribution on its handsets globally, would be complementary. And a way for Apple to potentially increase the sales of handsets globally, where its market share is a quarter of Android’s. Buy OpenAI. Apple has the cash, and Jony Ive certainly knows his way around the halls at Cupertino. It’s possible that acquiring both an AI-OS and a device that could expand the reach of the Apple ecosystem is worth it to Apple. The partnership has given them a good look at how the two firms could work together. It would give Apple a crack at creating a commerce ecosystem, and OpenAI access to Apple’s balance sheet and management team to accelerate development. Buy OpenAI None of these moves are small. But the market is moving too quickly for Apple to buy another year with demos or promises. Chipping away at the margin and banking on brand loyalty to stick it out won’t save Apple. If it wants to stay relevant, it needs to act decisively. Apple became Apple by turning technology into experiences. It didn’t just make devices, it created ecosystems. It built end-to-end worlds where hardware, software and content worked together. Companies that win in an AI-native world won’t just bolt GenAI onto existing products. Apple seems caught flat-footed for an interface that’s invisible. Where the OS is a model. Where the user interface is a conversation. Where voice is how the conversation starts and continues. Where the agent is the user experience. And where Siri, after being the first to market with a voice-assistant, continues to disappoint nearly 15 years later. In a space where speed to market is everything, and defines relevance, Apple is behind the curve. At the same time the rest of the GenAI and agentic pack, with an appreciable head start and momentum, are wasting no time to innovate, improve and drive usage and adoption. Arriving late to the party is nothing new for Apple. Tim Cook once famously said that they don’t always arrive first, but they always arrive with something better. I’m not even sure that’s true. But in any case, it’s been a long time since Apple has delivered late and better. What is true is this. The next chapter of AI is already being written. The only question is whether, where and how Apple will be part of it.

Title: Italian call a distant memory for new Lion Clarkson

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist As Thomas Clarkson stood in Melbourne's Marvel Stadium, clutching his newly minted British and Irish Lions cap, he reflected on a sliding doors moment from two years earlier. Fun fact: The 25-year-old's full name is actually Tommaso Clarkson, with his mother Nina Cafolla coming from a small town between Rome and Naples. At the start of the 2023/24 season, the Italians came calling. Clarkson turned down the offer, but with the tighthead prop yet to get his full break at Leinster, his qualification to play for Italy was kept in his back pocket, just in case. "They came looking for me, but I'd just signed a new contract with Leinster," he said, after making his Lions debut against the First Nations and Pasifika XV on Tuesday night. "I thought it could be open at some point down the line, but obviously, this year it's gone very well." It's been a fast 12 months for Clarkson. A run of games to start the season, and injuries elsewhere, saw him brought into the Ireland squad for the first time in November as a training panellist. He was retained after the training camp and impressed in two appearances off the bench against Argentina and Fiji. More big appearances came in the Champions Cup, and four more Irish caps followed in the Six Nations, before he produced arguably his best Leinster performance in their URC final win against the Bulls, a game he says was the moment where he believes he arrived. "It all kind of just clicked [that day] and then kept that momentum going," he said. "That was the first game when I was like, 'that was a proper performance’." He thought he finished the season with two more Irish caps against Georgia and Portugal, scoring a try in the second of those wins, and it was while celebrating that victory with a few beers in the early hours of the morning in Lisbon that he received an urgent message from Andy Farrell. "It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said ‘oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [Paul O’Connell] rang me and was like, ‘ring him right now!’ "So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. "I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it." His dream Lions call-up wasn’t met with universal warmth outside of Ireland, mainly due to the him being the 18th Irish international drafted in by Farrell on this tour, and the third tighthead prop. Farrell made a point of namechecking Clarkson (above) after last night’s game, insisting he was very much the "next cab on the rank" when he was called into the group, and the player says that message has been drilled into him by the coaching staff. "It wasn't a kind of ‘nepo’ selection if you’d call it that," Clarkson added. "It was just nice to hear going into it. We were bouncing into the game. "I benefited from Tadhg [Furlong] being injured at the end of the season, definitely benefited from that. "But I'd like to think I took the opportunity. "I've been kind of understudied to Tadhg for a good few years now. He's consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. "It's been unbelievable being there, just around him. "Rabah’s [Rabah Slimani] come in, probably offered something a bit different, where he's 100% scrum. "Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it. Whereas Rabah, when you're scrumming against him in training, it's all or nothing." While the breaks have fallen his way this season, he served a long apprenticeship at the province, in large part down to playing behind Furlong, as well as Michael Ala’alatoa in previous years. Remarkably, he was lining out for Blackrock College in Division 1B of the Energia All-Ireland League as recently as January 2024. Asked if he though playing for the Lions was on the cards even six months ago, he admitted "not a hope!". "I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I've been waiting a long time," he said. "The fact that when it has come, it's all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really. So yeah, it’s mad. "I put a lot of work into getting it, so any time I did get a shot, there was a whole lot of work behind it. So it felt like it just kind of rolled into another. "Once I got a foot in the door, I think I was trying to open it fully." Barring a couple of injuries, it’s likely Clarkson has now finally finished his gruelling, 27-game season, and will head home with something to remember it by. "It’s crazy, 886," he says, repeating the number stitched into his red and gold Lions cap after Tuesday’s win. "I didn't even know they did caps if you don't play in the Test. It's some energy."

Title: Vibe Coding Turned This Swedish AI Unicorn Into The Fastest Growing Software Startup Ever
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/07/23/vibe-coding-turned-this-swedish-ai-unicorn-into-the-fastest-growing-software-startup-ever/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T10:30:00Z

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin, Forbes Staff. Oskar Munck af Rosenschöld never planned to be in show business. But over a fika (coffee break) in Stockholm, Sweden, a film producer friend pitched him on a startup idea: a marketplace to match films with financiers, helping European moviemakers with the neverending task of raising money. Often such ideas never escape the talking stage. But just a few months later, FrameSage was live and had booked its first $50,000 in revenue—thanks to a new AI coding tool, Lovable, that Munck af Rosenschöld used to build the company’s plumbing in just 10 days. “You feel like you have the magic key to build software,” says Munck af Rosenschöld, whose works as a project mana­ger at a pharma company by day and who had never coded before outside of school. “This has saved us tens of thousands of dollars on developers and around four months’ work.” Munck af Rosenschöld isn’t the only young founder to have fallen for Lovable, Sweden’s new AI unicorn. In June alone, around 750,000 projects—apps, websites, entire businesses—were built, hosted and launched with a handful of descriptive sentences and a few clicks on Lovable. This isn’t like the clunky website builders of yesteryear, responsible for zillions of personal sites; nor are they sketches or wireframes that might look cool but aren’t functional. Lovable projects, spun up in minutes thanks to generative AI, are actual working products with features ranging from email newsletters to payments via Stripe. “I was shown Lovable and knew what I was going to do for the coming years,” says Malmö, Sweden–based Jaleel Miles, who built his restaurant management startup, Quicktables, in just two months on Lovable. He has booked over $120,000 in sales from the site since May. Lovable has become the fastest-growing software startup in history, reaching $100 million in subscription revenue (on an annualized basis) in just eight months since its launch last November, eclipsing other rocketships like Israeli cloud security startup Wiz and San Francisco–based HR platform Deel (which hit the same benchmark in 18 months and just under two years, respectively). “Humans are builders at heart, but being able to write code, or having access to capital, has been the defining part of being able to build software,” says cofounder and CEO Anton Osika, 34, who started Lovable in September 2023. “Now we are entering a new era.” It’s not just scrappy young founders who are building on Lovable. Rio de Janeiro–based QConcursos has about 200 staff helping Brazilian students prepare for college and civil service exams. CEO Caio Moretti says he used Lovable to spin up a new premium version of its app in just two weeks. It made over $3 million in its first 48 hours. “If we were coding on our legacy platform it would have taken us a year to build a new product,” he says. Photo by Sebastian Nevols for Forbes It was a pickleball tournament tracking app that did it for Accel partner Ben Fletcher. The London-based investor built the gadget on Lovable in a weekend, then spun up a tool that helps Accel sift through startup sales data. He’s now leading a $200 million round in the Swedish startup, which values the 45-person company at $1.8 billion (its cofounders’ estimated 50% stake is jointly worth $900 million). “We see Lovable as an opinionated CTO that builds your product for you,” says Osika, who has just started writing his own small checks into Lovable’s most promising projects. That $200 million, on top of the $23 million it raised previously, should help Lovable fend off competition from well-funded Bay Area rivals like Replit (which last raised $97 million at a $1.2 billion valuation) and StackBlitz—which raised $105 million in January and is on this year’s Next Billion-Dollar Startups list. But it’s not just other upstarts Lovable needs to worry about. AI giants OpenAI and Google, whose Firebase Studio can build apps and websites from prompts in simple English, are also interested in the so-called “vibe coding” market. The same tech that’s powering Lovable and its rivals is also sweeping through Silicon Valley’s professional ranks. Startups like Cursor, Cline and Cognition’s code writing tools for pro programmers are transforming how tech is built. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella claims that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI. Google’s Sundar Pichai, who has made similar claims, reportedly just spent $2.4 billion to poach the founders of Windsurf to pump up Google’s AI code tools. Once-coveted software engineers were reportedly caught up in recent layoffs at both companies. Venture fund SignalFire, which tracks tech recruitment, saw hires for entry-level coders drop by a quarter last year. But Lovable doesn’t pretend to cater to the pros. Its fans are tinkerers, designers and entrepreneurs. “Developers are really important, but they’re only 1% of the market,” Fletcher says. For entrepreneurs like Theresa Anoje, who had never coded anything beyond tweaks to her Tumblr page, Lovable has been a game changer. For years, the San Francisco–based founder wanted to build her careers newsletter, Remotely Good, into a full-fledged job-hunting website but had hit a wall with fundraising and scaling up. Then she built a new website in just a weekend with Lovable. “It was an enormous relief,” she says. “It was a revelation.” Lovable lets anyone make a handful of simple projects for free, but more-complex features and AI code requests can be unlocked with fees star-ting at $25 per month. Building something like the classic cellphone game Snake would cost the equivalent of a buck in Lovable credits, while a more-elaborate app could run upward of $50. That’s still less than the hourly rate of even humdrum human programmers. Osika himself didn’t start out as a coder, even though he’s been programming since age 12 the same type of simple games that Lovable can now build in minutes. He studied physics at Sweden’s elite KTH Royal Institute of Technology and then joined CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, in Switzerland. He lasted only a few months; CERN had a thousands-strong army of the best physicists in the world, but Osika quickly started to think the slow grind on “impossible projects” like hunting dark matter was a waste of human potential. “The realization was that you have much, much more impact being in industry, building companies,” he says. After a stint at Stockholm-based proprietary trading firm Ampfield, Osika joined an education AI startup in 2017, then signed on as cofounder and CTO at Depict AI, helping cofounder Oliver Edholm sell an Amazon-style product recommendation algorithm to retailers. They joined startup hothouse Y Combinator and within a year generated $1 million of revenue, raising $17 million in 2022 from big-name investors like Tiger Global. But Depict’s growth fizzled along with pandemic e-commerce mania, and AI began to catch fire with the launch of ChatGPT. “I was thinking, ‘We have to do this at Depict, or I have to find a way to leverage this huge wave that is coming toward us,’ ” Osika says. He was so sure of the potential that he built an AI tool dubbed GPT Engineer in his spare time, publishing it to developer platform Github in June 2023. When the app shot to the top of Github’s trending page almost overnight, Osika knew he was on to something. So he quit, recruiting former Depict staffer Fabian Hedin to be his cofounder and CTO. The duo decided to turn his code-heavy GPT Engineer into a visual tool that anyone could use. “There was this realization that this was extremely powerful,” Hedin says. They raised an $8 million seed round led by venture fund Hummingbird in October 2023. When the first version of Lovable flopped, they rewired it to handle more than simple games or static websites. Lovable raked in more than $5 million in just over a month after the team relaunched in November 2024. Lovable is now booking around $1 million a day in subscriptions, but competition is fierce. Its focus on portfolio sites and simple prototypes puts it on a collision course with an earlier generation of unicorns like Figma and website builders such as Wix and Squarespace. All these companies are also building their own AI tools. Figma launched a code generator earlier this year, and in June, Nasdaq-listed Wix spent $80 million to buy a six-month-old AI coding startup. Lovable has limitations. It aces web design, but the plumbing of more complex apps still needs a human touch. For Dutch AI engineer Lennert Jansen, a Lovable-built prototype was enough to land a spot at Y Combinator for his startup Airweave, which helps connect apps like Gmail with autonomous bits of code called AI agents. Lovable struggled with the technical back end, so Jansen and his cofounder hand-coded it and have since rewritten the remaining Lovable code. Still, accelerating the early work meant serious time savings. “If we hadn’t had Lovable, it wouldn’t have given us this tangible starting point,” Jansen says. “It was a massive win with the speed this market moves.” Now Airweave is making $17,000 a month and just landed $6 million in funding. Another vulnerability: Like many in its cohort of vibe-coding startups, Lovable relies on the same set of underlying AI models, notably Anthropic’s Claude. Lovable is spending millions of dollars a month on these models to power its coding. Some other startups are even heavier spenders, which has put Anthropic on track to make a reported $4 billion in revenue this year. Now Anthropic, last valued at $60 billion, is selling its own code tool directly. Osika can’t do much about this competition other than to stick to building products that humans love and hop between AI models for the best and cheapest. “Humans understand humans,” he says, “and Lovable is this enabling tool to make ideas come to life in minutes.” Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images DB Apple/picture alliance/DPA/Newscom

Business FILE PHOTO: Representations of cryptocurrencies are seen in front of displayed decreasing stock graph in this illustration taken November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo NEW YORK :Tokenization has long been a buzzword for crypto enthusiasts, who have been arguing for years that blockchain-based assets will change the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The technology is seen as rapidly increasing in coming years, especially in the U.S., helped by the passage of three new bills. President Donald Trump's administration has eased regulation of the broader crypto industry, paving the way for a boom in the valuation of companies in the sector and the rapid growth of crypto-related securities. However, the growth of the market for tokenized assets has been far slower than expected in recent years, with many projects still in their infancy or not yet live. HOW DOES TOKENIZATION WORK?

WHERE DO STABLECOINS COME IN?Stablecoins can be seen as an example of tokenization. They are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value by being pegged to a real-world currency, typically the U.S. dollar.

Title: The stock market is on a hot streak. It’s about to face a huge test | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Six months into President Donald Trump’s second term, a quick glance at the stock market offers a reassuring picture: The S&P 500 just closed above 6,300 points for the first time ever and has notched eight record highs in the past month. If you look at markets halfway into the year, it might not be apparent that there has been unprecedented trade turmoil, conflict in the Middle East and relentless attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The stock market and bitcoin have soared to record highs, while bonds have resumed a steady rally and volatility in oil prices has subsided. Global markets so far this year have been remarkably resilient. The calm mood on Wall Street is an extraordinary change from early April, when the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in over a year and was on the precipice of a bear market after Trump unveiled his initial “Liberation Day” tariffs. “Perhaps the move by US stocks off the early-April lows is emblematic of the age-old adage about bull markets often climbing a ‘wall of worry,’” Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon, investment strategists at Charles Schwab, said in a note. “There is no shortage of things to worry about; but that’s the wall markets often climb.” Markets are floating near record highs despite underlying tariff uncertainty. While investors have begun to shrug off a myriad of concerns, US stocks are trading at historically expensive valuations as Trump’s self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches. As Trump presses forward with his trade war, markets’ momentum will face a tariff test. “What has held stocks aloft … is the premise that whatever tariff increases come on August 1, they will not be permanent,” Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note. “The prospect that ‘deals’ will be struck thereafter remains a factor, we believe, in keeping traders from selling stocks more aggressively,” Wizman said. Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist, strategists at LPL Financial, said in a note that the S&P 500’s “unusually sharp and swift ‘V-shaped recovery’” from its low point in early April was “one of the most powerful post-correction rebounds in stock market history.” The ferocity of the market’s recovery has raised questions about whether it is supported by fundamentals — or if underlying weakness could arise. While the market experienced bouts of enormous volatility in recent months, stocks continue to push higher. The S&P 500 is up 5.2% since Trump took office. Trump has acknowledged the market’s rebound. The president earlier this month told NBC News that “tariffs have been very well received,” noting that the “stock market hit a new high.” The “softening” of initial tariff announcements has “removed the worst-case scenarios” for outlooks for economic growth and inflation, investors at BlackRock said in a note, which has supported the market’s rally. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers trading platform, told CNN that the rally has also been driven by momentum and a fear of missing out. “Ever since the president’s about-face in early April that turned the market around, a lot of money has been made basically by investors assuming that these tariffs will be postponed, renegotiated or otherwise watered down,” Sosnick said. “And if there’s a trade that works very well for people over a long period of time, they’re going to keep doing it.” Meanwhile, bitcoin last week surged to a record high above $123,000 as Republicans in Congress pressed forward with landmark legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note that they think the “US economy will weather the global trade war,” enabling the S&P 500 to rise further. However, they said, Trump’s “unpredictable approach” to trade and attacks on the Fed’s independence could “trigger” a downturn in stocks. “The widespread assumption among market participants still appears to be that the president will not follow through on threats to raise tariffs much further and that Chair Powell will remain in place, but that may prove too optimistic,” they said. The S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of more than 1% since June 24. It’s a sign that momentum has slowed down. Bitcoin traded around $119,000 as of Tuesday. Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said she thinks markets might be complacent about potential risks, given stocks are historically expensive. While stocks and bonds have emerged relatively unscathed, one outlier is the US dollar, which has continued a precipitous decline. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 11% since Trump took office. Gold and silver, meanwhile, have continued to serve as hedges against Trump’s trade uncertainty. The yellow and silver precious metals have soared 30% and 35% this year, respectively. The rally in recent months has been driven by retail investors, or individuals buying their own stocks, as opposed to Wall Street institutions, according to Venu Krishna, an equity strategist at Barclays. “Re-risking by institutional money remains muted, making it likely that retail investors were at the helm for the latest leg of the rally,” Krishna said. He estimates retail investors poured more than $50 billion into global stocks across the past month. Investors who bought the dip when markets dropped in April have been rewarded with an extraordinary march to fresh highs. The S&P 500 has gained almost 27% since its low point in April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared almost 37%. Related article Wall Street is calling Trump’s bluff The smaller Nasdaq 100 has gone 62 days without crossing below its 20-day moving average, which is the second longest streak on record after a 77-day streak in 1999, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at investment firm BTIG. And Wall Street money that has been on the sidelines has been creeping back into the market. A survey of global fund managers in July by Bank of America showed the biggest surge in “risk appetite” on record. The survey also showed the most bullish sentiment since February. Ethan Harris, a market watcher and former economist at Bank of America, said in a post on LinkedIn that Trump’s tariff announcements could be characterized as “Trump always tries again,” as opposed to “Trump always chickens out.” “His aggressive announcements are a way to test what he can ‘get away with,’” Harris said. “Hence the steady flow of new threats, partial retreats and then more threats.” As stocks hold near record highs as Trump’s trade deadline approaches, it remains to be seen whether markets will push back on the president’s plan to disrupt international trade. “The bond vigilantes may or may not have started to make a comeback this year,” Harris said. “Will the stock market become the trade war vigilante or remain complacent?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Meme Stocks Are Back—Should You Be Worried?

Meme stocks are back in the spotlight. Shares of apparel retailer Kohl’s (KSS) opened nearly 90% higher Tuesday and online home buying website Opendoor’s (OPEN) shares popped nearly 20% at the open. Neither shared any business updates, but both were major topics of conversation on r/wallstreetbets, the subreddit that fueled the meme stock craze of 2021. As in 2021, a short squeeze may have been the culprit for the Tuesday morning spike. Nearly 50% of Kohl’s shares were sold short at the end of June, according to data from FactSet. The stock’s rising price could have forced some short sellers to cover their position by buying the stock, adding to the demand driving up its price. Tuesday's squeeze was relatively short-lived. Kohl’s stock pared its gains throughout the session’s first 30 minutes and ended the day 38% higher. Opendoor, which more than doubled in value last week and gained another 40% Monday, finished Tuesday's session down 10%. Come Wednesday morning, meme traders were hunting for new opportunities. Shares of Krispy Kreme (DNUT) and GoPro (GPRO) jumped 27% and 60%, respectively, in early trading, while Kohl's and Opendoor slumped. The return of meme stocks may have something to do with the stock market’s recent success. Stocks hit a series of record highs in recent weeks as Wall Street cheered tax cuts and pro-crypto legislation, and looked forward to trade deals. The Magnificent Seven rode AI excitement to trade near record highs, with Nvidia (NVDA) becoming the first company to ever reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. Speculative assets like cryptocurrencies have performed particularly well in recent months. Bitcoin traded at $120,000 on Tuesday afternoon, not far from its all-time high of about $123,000. Ethereum has rallied nearly 60% in the last month. Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) skyrocketed about 750% in the two weeks after its IPO in early June. There have been signs for some time that retail investors were losing interest in the Magnificent Seven after their run-up that started in late 2022. Mom-and-pop investors looking for big gains pivoted into riskier corners of the market, like small caps and more obscure AI plays, in the second quarter, according to data from Vanda Research. That trend accelerated in July, with high-beta equities like Joby (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), BigBear.ai (BBAI) among the most bought stocks by retail investors this month. Flurries of speculative activity like that seen Tuesday are sometimes interpreted as signs of market frothiness, and thus precursors to pullbacks. Though that's not always the case, and even with stocks at record highs, investors have yet to pile into equities at alarming rates. Deutsche Bank's measure of equity positioning only rose from "neutral" to "overweight" last week. "In the absence of a clear negative catalyst, there is room for positioning to continue trending higher," according to strategist Parag Thatte. Update—July 23, 2025: This story has been updated with additional share prices after markets opened on Wednesday.

Title: A laid-off Microsoft manager says it's not a personal failure, but he may pivot away from management
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-manager-laid-off-great-flattening-next-career-move-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-23T08:32:01Z

Patrice Melekian wanted to experience life in the US, and his job at Microsoft was his ticket. He told Business Insider he had a good, 17-year run with the company — until he got laid off from his manager job in May. He's returned to his home country of France, and while he's still figuring out his next career move, he said he might look outside management for his next role. Like many laid-off workers, Melekian doesn't know exactly why his job was cut. But he said Microsoft leaders have spoken about reducing management layers and improving efficiency — language that has coincided with manager layoffs over the past year. Melekian believes these efforts are part of a broader trend in tech. "Many companies in the tech industry, including Microsoft, have been moving to flatten their organizations to streamline the decision process," said the 54-year-old. In May, Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees in an effort to increase what it calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager, Business Insider previously reported. Then, earlier this month, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more workers. A spokesperson told BI earlier this month that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. It's not just Microsoft. Companies like Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. This trend, which some have dubbed the "Great Flattening," refGreat Flatteningpush to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. Microsoft did not respond to BI's request for comment. We want to hear from middle managers, job seekers, and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one or more of the linked Google Forms. Melekian joined Microsoft in 2007 through an acquisition, taking on a role as a program manager architect. He grew up in France and was living in Paris at the time, but became interested in moving to the US — partly out of curiosity about what it would be like to live there. In 2013, he relocated with his wife and two sons from Paris to Redmond, Washington — home to Microsoft's headquarters — to take a senior program manager role. At the time of his layoff, he was a principal product manager, leading a team of three. While Microsoft's effort to reduce management layers could leave some managers with more direct reports, Melekian said the number of people reporting to him hovered between two and three, depending on business needs — a structure he thinks worked well for his team. He said his role, which required balancing management responsibilities with hands-on project work, didn't change much during his three years as a principal product manager. Having a modest team size gave him the flexibility to spend more time on projects — something he appreciated. "When you have a team of three, you don't have to spend that much time managing," he said. "If a new opportunity came up and everybody was packed, that allowed me to jump in, take some of my own time, and go after it myself." Melekian said he started his principal product manager role during the pandemic, when remote work was widespread at the company. When Microsoft's offices reopened, he had the option to continue working from home and chose to do so. Microsoft's policy currently allows most employees to work remotely at least part of the time, though a decline in productivity could prompt a shift in policy, BI previously reported. Though a layoff is rarely happy news, Melekian said the timing was relatively fortunate: He had already been planning to move back to France for personal and family reasons. With his parents getting older, he wanted to be closer in case they needed support. His youngest son also just graduated from high school and plans to attend school in France this fall. "With our children and our own aging parents all being in France, there was nothing holding my wife and me back in the US," he said. Melekian said he's already sold his home in the US and returned to France, but hasn't started actively job hunting yet. He plans to do so later this summer once he's more settled. When his job search picks up, he's not sure whether he'll prioritize management roles or individual contributor positions. He said he may prefer a role with less managerial responsibility — one where he can have a more direct impact. "Manager roles certainly align with my experience, but I may also consider roles where I can contribute directly with my expertise," he said. Melekian said he has a few pieces of advice for people who are dealing with layoffs or career transitions. First, rely on others for advice and support. "You'd be surprised how willing people are to share their own similar experiences and help you navigate transitions," he said. Additionally, he recommended people keep an open mind to different job opportunities — and not rush their next career decision. "A layoff can feel like a personal failure, but it's usually the result of a broader business shift rather than an indication of your worth as a professional," he said. "Use the pause as an opportunity to reassess what's genuinely important for you personally and professionally." Jump to

Title: Strategic Plan for the United States to Accumulate 4 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/07/23/strategic-plan-for-the-united-states-to-accumulate-4-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T06:25:26Z
Full Content:
Executive Summary The United States is embarking on a bold, 15-year strategic initiative to accumulate 4 million Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This visionary plan spans short-term (1–3 years) foundational actions, mid-term (4–7 years) expansion, and long-term (8–15 years) consolidation. It mobilizes all sectors – federal and state governments, private corporations, financial institutions, the tech industry, and individual citizens – in a coordinated effort. The strategy is funded through innovative, budget-neutral mechanisms (leveraging existing reserves, redirected budgets, public-private investment, and blockchain-related revenues) and emphasizes ethical, legal acquisition methods (mining, market investment, ETFs, voluntary pooling, and international partnerships). Strategic objectives include enhancing economic resilience, diversifying national reserves, cementing blockchain technology leadership, and strengthening national security. This plan anticipates and addresses challenges such as market impact, global competition, regulatory frameworks, and environmental sustainability. The following report details a roadmap for this initiative, with clear milestones, roles for each stakeholder, and an inspirational vision of American leadership in the digital asset era. Introduction: A New Frontier in National Economic Strategy Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” has matured from a niche experiment into a credible strategic asset on the global stage . With its permanently capped supply of 21 million BTC, Bitcoin’s scarcity and security present a unique opportunity for nations that move early to incorporate it into their reserves . Just as the U.S. historically accumulated gold and foreign currency reserves, the time has come to thoughtfully manage national ownership of digital assets for prosperity . Other countries and forward-looking leaders have begun to recognize Bitcoin’s potential. The United States itself holds a significant amount of Bitcoin from forfeitures, but until recently had no comprehensive strategy to leverage these holdings . A turning point came with high-level proposals and actions in 2024–2025, including calls for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and legislation to acquire substantial BTC for the Treasury . These moves signaled that Bitcoin is entering the halls of U.S. fiscal policy as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation . Why 4 million Bitcoin? This ambitious target – roughly 20% of Bitcoin’s eventual supply – would position America as the world’s largest Bitcoin holder, securing a dominant stake in the digital asset that could shape the future of finance. Holding such a reserve over decades is envisioned to strengthen the dollar’s resilience, hedge against economic volatility, and even help address the national debt by capitalizing on Bitcoin’s historical growth trajectory . While bold, this goal is in line with America’s tradition of thinking big and leading in new frontiers, from the space race to the internet revolution. Core Values and Principles: This strategy aligns with U.S. values of innovation, free enterprise, and individual liberty. It relies on voluntary, market-driven participation rather than coercion – there will be no forced appropriation of private Bitcoin holdings. Instead, the government will incentivize and inspire collective action. Transparency, rule of law, and respect for property rights will be upheld at every step. By embracing Bitcoin within a legal and ethical framework, the U.S. will demonstrate how democratic societies can innovate responsibly in the blockchain era. The following sections lay out the strategic objectives guiding this plan, the stakeholders involved and their roles, a phased roadmap across short, mid, and long-term horizons, funding sources and mechanisms, and considerations to mitigate risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that by 15 years from now, the United States will have not only accumulated 4 million BTC, but also solidified its position as the global leader in the digital asset economy – fostering prosperity, security, and technological leadership for generations to come. Strategic Objectives 1. Economic Resilience and Inflation Hedge Build a more resilient economy by holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s provable scarcity makes it akin to a digital commodity that cannot be inflated at will . By allocating a portion of national reserves to BTC, the U.S. can protect wealth against currency debasement and reduce reliance on any single foreign creditor or currency. Over time, Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation (historically averaging ~55% annually ) offers the potential to strengthen the national balance sheet and even help pay down public debt as its value grows . This financial buffer would enhance stability during economic downturns or crises, providing a store of value that is uncorrelated to traditional markets and immune to foreign political influence . 2. Digital Reserve Diversification Complement traditional reserves (such as gold and foreign currencies) with digital reserves. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve diversifies the nation’s holdings into a 21st-century asset class . Just as gold bolsters confidence in a country’s financial footing, Bitcoin – with its decentralized, transparent network – can serve as a trust anchor in an increasingly digital global economy. A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be a portfolio diversifier and innovation signal , reducing dependence on dollar-centric systems while positioning the nation for a future where digital assets play a key role in global finance . This diversification is pragmatic: it hedges against potential weakness in other reserves and embraces the evolving monetary landscape. 3. Technological Leadership and Innovation Assert American leadership in blockchain technology and the emerging digital economy. A national effort to accumulate Bitcoin goes hand-in-hand with promoting innovation in the underlying technologies – from cybersecurity and cryptography to financial technology. By actively engaging with Bitcoin, the U.S. signals that it is the best place to develop and deploy blockchain innovations, attracting talent and investment. Strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a “statement of alignment with a digitally native economic future,” providing a blueprint that encourages private sector adoption and innovation . This objective includes fostering a robust domestic cryptocurrency industry, supporting research in energy-efficient mining and scalability, and setting global standards for blockchain use. Ultimately, it’s about ensuring the next generation of tech companies and protocols are made in America, securing our role as the global hub of blockchain development. 4. National Security and Geopolitical Influence Enhance national security by preventing strategic adversaries from dominating the crypto realm and by leveraging Bitcoin as a geopolitical asset. In the 21st century, economic security is national security. If Bitcoin and other digital assets become integral to the world financial system, the U.S. must not fall behind. A substantial BTC reserve gives America greater influence over the future of decentralized finance, much as our gold reserves bolstered our clout in the 20th century. It also acts as a neutral reserve asset that could reinforce alliances (for example, through coordinated accumulation or exchange agreements with allies) and provide options in sanction regimes or international aid (using BTC for humanitarian payments where traditional systems fail). By leading in Bitcoin ownership, the U.S. can help set global norms (for transparency, anti-money-laundering, cyber defense) and ensure that open societies, not authoritarian regimes, shape the rules of digital finance. As Senator Cynthia Lummis noted, Bitcoin’s strategic importance for the country is such that some call it “manifest destiny for the United States” – a new frontier to secure for the nation’s freedom and prosperity. These objectives are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. Economic strength supports security; technological leadership fuels economic growth; reserve diversification aids resilience; and all enhance America’s standing in the world. With the “why” established, we now turn to the “how” – the stakeholders and strategies that will deliver on these objectives. Key Stakeholders and Their Roles Achieving a goal as ambitious as accumulating 4 million BTC requires a “whole-of-America” approach, engaging public and private sectors as well as individual citizens. Each stakeholder group has unique strengths to contribute: All these actors will coordinate under a shared vision. A National Digital Assets Task Force can be established to ensure communication and synergy between federal agencies, state governments, industry leaders, and community representatives. Regular summits and progress reports will keep everyone aligned. The message is clear: every American can be part of this endeavor, and everyone stands to benefit from the innovation, wealth creation, and security enhancements it will bring. Strategic Roadmap by Timeframe The journey to 4 million Bitcoin is mapped out in three phases – short-term, mid-term, and long-term – each with specific initiatives and milestones. This phased approach ensures steady progress while allowing assessment and course-correction at each stage. Importantly, actions are designed to minimize market disruption (accumulating gradually and via multiple avenues) and remain flexible to technological and economic developments. Short-Term (1–3 Years): Laying the Foundation Goals (1–3 years): Establish the legal, institutional, and infrastructural groundwork for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation. Kickstart the reserve with existing assets, enact supportive policies, and galvanize private sector involvement – all while raising public awareness. Early moves are budget-neutral or low-cost, relying on reallocated resources and voluntary participation to avoid burdening taxpayers. Milestones for Phase 1: With the foundation laid and early momentum achieved, the stage is set to accelerate into the mid-term phase. Mid-Term (4–7 Years): Scaling Up and Integration Goals (4–7 years): Rapidly scale the accumulation efforts while integrating Bitcoin more deeply into U.S. economic structures. In this phase, the aim is to go from hundreds of thousands of BTC to millions of BTC under American ownership. The federal government, having proven the concept and established trust in phase 1, can expand its holdings more aggressively (market conditions permitting), and the private sector’s involvement becomes self-sustaining. This phase will likely coincide with greater global attention – both cooperation and competition – which the U.S. must navigate wisely. Milestones for Phase 2: At the end of the mid-term phase, the U.S. should be well on its way to the 4 million BTC goal, possibly around halfway there, and the foundations of a crypto-powered economy fully laid. The final phase will focus on securing the gains and leveraging them for enduring advantage. Long-Term (8–15 Years): Leadership, Preservation, and Prosperity Goals (8–15 years): By this phase, the United States envisions reaching the 4 million BTC target and solidifying the permanence of Bitcoin in its national asset mix. The focus shifts from aggressive accumulation to sustainable management and utilization of the reserve as needed for the national interest (without ever undermining Bitcoin’s ecosystem). America’s leadership in the blockchain space should be unquestioned by year 15, and the strategic Bitcoin reserve serves as a foundation for economic strength, much like gold did in previous eras. This period also involves adapting to any new developments (technological, geopolitical) that could affect our Bitcoin strategy. Milestones for Phase 3: Funding Sources and Mechanisms A variety of funding sources and mechanisms are employed across these phases to finance Bitcoin accumulation in a sustainable, ethical manner. Below is a summary of key funding approaches, emphasizing creativity and public-private collaboration: All these funding sources share a common theme: they are ethical, transparent, and largely voluntary/market-driven. The plan pointedly avoids any coercive measures like forced confiscation or heavy new taxation that would contradict the values of a free economy. By tapping into existing value, future growth, and willing participation, the U.S. can accumulate Bitcoin in a way that strengthens rather than burdens the nation. It’s worth noting that as Bitcoin’s price potentially grows, the dollar cost of reaching 4 million BTC will increase. Thus, early funding (short-term) gets more “bang for buck” in BTC terms, while later on the focus might shift to maximizing value of holdings rather than chasing a numeric BTC total at any cost. Flexibility in funding strategy will be maintained – if Bitcoin’s market is overheated, the U.S. can pause buys and rely more on mining or wait for corrections, for example. Ethical, Legal, and Security Considerations A plan of this magnitude raises important ethical and legal considerations, which are addressed proactively to ensure the initiative upholds American values and the rule of law: In summary, the ethical and legal framework surrounding this strategy is robust: voluntary, transparent, lawful, and responsible. The plan is designed to amplify the best of American capitalism and democracy – using open markets and free choice to achieve a national goal – while putting checks in place to curb excesses or missteps. This strategic journey will be one carried out in the public eye, inviting input and scrutiny, which will only strengthen its execution. Conclusion: A Future-Focused Vision for American Prosperity Fifteen years from now, Americans will look back on this initiative as a pivotal chapter in our nation’s economic story – the moment we seized the opportunity of a digital frontier and made it our own. By accumulating 4 million bitcoins, the United States positions itself not only to benefit from the growth of a revolutionary asset but also to steer that revolution in accordance with our values of freedom, transparency, and innovation. This comprehensive plan harnesses the collective power of federal resolve, state creativity, private sector dynamism, and individual enthusiasm. It is inspirational and optimistic by design: it says that America’s best days are not behind us, but ahead on a new horizon of blockchain technology and digital finance. Just as past generations rallied to ambitious national endeavors – building the transcontinental railroad, landing on the moon, inventing the internet – we too rally to make the U.S. the guiding light in the crypto era. By pursuing this strategy, the U.S. will enjoy a more resilient and diversified economy, new waves of tech entrepreneurship, and a strengthened geopolitical hand. We will have shown that embracing change, rather than fearing it, is the surest path to long-term prosperity and security. The strategic Bitcoin reserve, once a novel idea, will become a cornerstone of national strength – a digital complement to Fort Knox, symbolizing American ingenuity in the 21st century. There will undoubtedly be challenges along the way: market fluctuations, technical hurdles, perhaps political debates. But as laid out, we have plans to navigate these – cautiously, transparently, and boldly when needed. The involvement of all stakeholders means this vision does not belong to one party or administration, but to all Americans. It can and should unite us in common purpose, much like great infrastructure or exploration projects of the past. In conclusion, this strategic plan is more than an economic play – it’s a statement to the world that America remains the land of forward-looking visionaries, unafraid to invest in the future. It invites every citizen, entrepreneur, and public servant to be a part of forging a new legacy. Together, we are not just accumulating coins; we are building a foundation of economic freedom, technological leadership, and national renewal that will support the American Dream for generations to come. Let us proceed with confidence, creativity, and unity on this path. The digital frontier is ours to lead – and in doing so, we will secure the blessings of prosperity and security for ourselves and our posterity, in the true spirit of the United States of America.

Title: Will Bitcoin will soar past $200,000 within five years?

Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back.

Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years? Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back.

Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years? Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back. September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems.

Title: ONDO price rallies on 21Shares’ ETF filing and major exchange listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ondo-price-rallies-on-21shares-etf-filing-and-major-exchange-listing/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T05:27:37Z

Ondo Finance’s native coin signals imminent breakouts despite the broad market cool down, fueled by two key developments. First and foremost, asset manager 21Shares has filed with the US SEC to launch an ONDO exchange-traded fund (ETF). Secondly, Binance US confirmed listing the altcoin, with trading starting today, July 23. ONDO soared from the daily low of $1.0583 to $1.1642, a 10% increase, as the bullish news sparked bullish momentum. ONDO is at the center of Ondo Finance’s goal of bringing traditional assets on-chain. With interest in real-world asset (RWA) platforms skyrocketing, 21Shares and Binance US’ moves could not be better as retail and institutional investors seek Ondo exposure. The crypto has witnessed a surge in institutional appetite, with giants like BlackRock showing interest. MasterCard tapped Ondo Finance as its first RWA provider, while Ripple leveraged the blockchain to launch OUSG on its XRPL. 21Shares increases Ondo’s institutional appeal with the latest ETF application. JUST IN: 21SHARES FILES FOR $ONDO ETF WITH U.S. SEC — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) July 22, 2025 The move confirms that traditional finance (TradiFi) is targeting the tokenization sector seriously. Moreover, seeking SEC authorization underscores the asset manager’s commitment to compliance and innovation in the tokenized sector of RWAs and DeFi. This is more than another cryptocurrency product. Ondo Finance remains at the core of the current trend of bringing real-world assets like US Treasuries, credit instruments, and bonds on-chain. Last week, Ondo Finance collaborated with BNB Chain to introduce tokenized equities in the United States. 21Shares’ proposed exchange-traded fund would offer cryptocurrency enthusiasts exposure to ONDO via licensed platforms, without brokerage sites. A leading crypto exchange in the United States, Binance US, confirmed listing Ondo Finance’s token on its trading platform. It opened deposits on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain yesterday, with ONDO/USDT trading set to start today. The official announcement read: We’re excited to announce that ONDO is now listed on Binance.US! Deposits for ONDO on the Ethereum network are now open. Trading for ONDO/USDT will begin tomorrow, July 23, 2025, at 4 a.m. / 7 a.m. EDT. Deposits for $ONDO are now open on https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS! Trading on the ONDO/USDT pair will begin on July 23 at 7 a.m. EDT.@OndoFoundation is a project that brings institutional-grade financial products onchain by tokenizing real-world assets.https://t.co/oTqaNwyhtO pic.twitter.com/QM5nJpn5hK — Binance.US 🇺🇸 (@BinanceUS) July 22, 2025 The listing is vital as it makes the ONDO token accessible to the massive American retail audience. Moreover, listing on leading exchanges often acts as a Launchpad for many tokens. More US citizens can now trade ONDO without depending on overseas platforms or decentralized exchanges. Ondo Finance’s native coin attracted attention amidst the optimistic developments. It trades at $1.11 after a brief correction from daily highs. Meanwhile, the surging 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed interest in the RWA token, hinting at continued uptrend. Technical indicators support the short-term momentum shift. For example, the MACD on the 3H chart displays green histograms after a bullish crossover, signaling a buyer comeback. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow shows increased ONDO accumulation over the past week. Such trends indicate trust in the token’s near-term performance. Ondo Finance bull target the late January price levels above $1.60. Overcoming this level could catalyze smooth gains to the psychological level at $2.

Title: Grayscale’s ETF chief David LaValle to leave ahead of company’s IPO: Unchained
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/grayscale-etf-leadership-ipo/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T04:04:15Z
Full Content:
Share this article Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, David LaValle, is stepping down at the end of July, closing out a four-year chapter marked by key milestones in the firm’s crypto ETF push, including the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF, Unchained reported Tuesday. LaValle joined Grayscale in August 2021 when its flagship Bitcoin fund held approximately $25 billion in assets, making it the world’s largest crypto asset manager at the time. In August 2023, Grayscale won a landmark victory over the SEC, which laid important legal groundwork for the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and opened the door for asset managers to ramp up efforts to bring other crypto funds to Wall Street. But the court victory also set the stage for intensified competition. It allowed fund management giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, to enter the crypto ETF space with confidence. With the launch of their own Bitcoin ETFs at far lower management fees, these industry titans quickly attracted institutional capital and retail investors. Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which generate the majority of its income, charge fees of 1.5% and 2.5% respectively. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF charges 0.25%. Grayscale has since lost its position as the world’s largest crypto asset manager to BlackRock, which now manages nearly $88 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust. GBTC’s assets currently stand at approximately $22 billion. LaValle’s departure comes as Grayscale is gearing toward an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. The company confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the SEC last week. Apart from going public, Grayscale is also seeking approval to launch numerous spot crypto ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and other leading digital assets. Earlier this month, the SEC approved Grayscale’s application to convert the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an ETF through staff’s delegated authority. However, just one day after this approval, the SEC’s commissioners decided to stay the approval for an internal review, effectively halting the fund’s launch temporarily.

Title: Amazon buys wearable AI device maker Bee for an undisclosed sum
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/22/amazon-buys-wearable-ai-device-maker-bee-undisclosed-sum/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T02:18:37Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 22:18 EDT / JULY 22 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is buying the wearable electronics startup Bee, officially known as Bluush Inc., for an undisclosed price, as part of a strategy to take the lead in more personal artificial intelligence services. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, was announced by Bee co-founder and Chief Executive Maria de Lourdes Zollo on LinkedIn, who proclaimed that the company couldn’t have found a better partner to bring “truly personal agentic AI to even more customers.” Bee, which launched earlier this year, is the developer of a smart bracelet device called the Bee Pioneer that’s somewhat similar to Fitbit. The device sells for $49.99 per month and users must also pay a monthly subscription fee of $19.99. It acts like a very personal, wearable AI assistant that records all that the user says and everything else it hears, though it can be muted at any time. The idea is that, by listening, it gets to know users so it can create to-do lists, reminders and provide them with advice and tips. The company closed on a $7 million seed funding round in July 2024. Zollo told TechCrunch in an interview at the time that it intends to create a kind of “cloud mirror” of the users’ smartphones, with access to all of their social media and email accounts, so it can provide timely reminders and tips and send messages on their behalf. According to Zollo, the startup wants to give everyone access to “personal, ambient intelligence” that feels like a “trusted companion,” helping them to navigate their world more easily. Bee isn’t alone in sharing this ambition, but it appears to have had more success than rival AI wearable startups such as Humane AI Inc. and Rabbit Inc., thanks to the low-cost nature of its devices. Humane AI’s now-discontinued Pin, in contrast, was sold at a hefty price of $499, so it wasn’t surprising that it ultimately went out of business. Rabbit is still around, but its R1 device costs four times as much as Bee’s wristband at $199. Bee has always made a big deal about its privacy, conscious that consumers are likely to have a lot of concerns about a device that records everything they say and tracks where they go. Bee needs to store some information, of course, so it can do its job as a personal assistant, but in its privacy policy, it explains that it doesn’t save or store user’s audio recordings, and it doesn’t use them for AI training. What it does do is save information that it learns about each user — such as a summary of what they talk about, the messages they receive and so on. But it notes that they can delete all of their data at any moment, should they choose to do so. Bee has also said it’s planning to update its device so it only records the voices of those who have consented to it, but it does not appear to do this currently. In addition, it has said it’s working on a feature that will allow users to set guidelines on what the device can and cannot record, based on different topics and locations. So the device would automatically switch itself off if the user ventures into the bedroom, for example. The startup is also looking to build a more powerful device capable of processing AI data internally rather than sending it to the cloud to be processed, which is something that will increase privacy for users. That said, it’s not clear if Bee will retain these policies and goals now that it’s set to be owned by Amazon. For its part, Amazon said in a statement that it “cares deeply” about user privacy and security. A spokesperson for the company told WinBuzzer that it has been a “strong steward of customer data” ever since it was founded, and pointed out that it has never been in the business of selling personal information to third parties. The spokesperson promised to work with Bee to give users “more control” over their devices. But it stopped short of saying it will adhere to its original policy of not storing audio data, so questions remain about how strong its privacy commitment really is. Amazon has previously stirred up controversy regarding its policies for the Amazon Ring security cameras, after sharing footage they recorded with law enforcement agencies without the owner’s consent. The acquisition is a strategic move for Amazon and suggests it’s a big believer in the idea that wearables will become the next big battleground for AI as it moves beyond the smartphone. It’s not the only technology giant that seems to think so either. Meta Platforms Inc. recently invested $3.5 billion in its smart glasses partner EssilorLuxottica SA, which has been working with a number of big name eyewear brands to popularize the concept of ambient intelligence. Meta previously partnered with Bausch & Lomb Corp. to develop the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and has already sold millions of those devices, illustrating the consumer appetite for intelligent wearables. It’s now building on that with its new line of Oakley Meta sunglasses aimed at athletes. OpenAI is also looking at wearable hardware as a foundation for AI, but it’s taking a different approach by acquiring io Products Inc., a somewhat secretive startup founded by former Apple Inc. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Prior to the acquisition, io was reported to be developing some kind of consumer AI device with no display, but it was never made clear exactly what form factor it would take. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman didn’t reveal much either, but instead articulated a vision of building “something beyond the legacy products we’ve been using for so long.” Bee does not represent Amazon’s first foray into wearable devices. In previously built a line of wristband health trackers called Halo, which were similar to Fitbit, but failed to make much of an impact and ultimately were discontinued it in 2023.

Title: Amazon buys wearable AI device maker Bee for an undisclosed fee
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/22/amazon-buys-wearable-ai-device-maker-bee-undisclosed-fee/

UPDATED 22:18 EDT / JULY 22 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is buying the wearable electronics startup Bee, officially known as Bluush Inc., for an undisclosed price, as part of a strategy to take the lead in more personal artificial intelligence services. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, was announced by Bee co-founder and Chief Executive Maria de Lourdes Zollo on LinkedIn, who proclaimed that the company couldn’t have found a better partner to bring “truly personal agentic AI to even more customers.” Bee, which launched earlier this year, is the developer of a smart bracelet device called the Bee Pioneer that’s somewhat similar to Fitbit. The device sells for $49.99 per month and users must also pay a monthly subscription fee of $19.99. It acts like a very personal, wearable AI assistant that records all that the user says and everything else it hears, though it can be muted at any time. The idea is that, by listening, it gets to know users so it can create to-do lists, reminders and provide them with advice and tips. The company closed on a $7 million seed funding round in July 2024. Zollo told TechCrunch in an interview at the time that it intends to create a kind of “cloud mirror” of the users’ smartphones, with access to all of their social media and email accounts, so it can provide timely reminders and tips and send messages on their behalf. According to Zollo, the startup wants to give everyone access to “personal, ambient intelligence” that feels like a “trusted companion,” helping them to navigate their world more easily. Bee isn’t alone in sharing this ambition, but it appears to have had more success than rival AI wearable startups such as Humane AI Inc. and Rabbit Inc., thanks to the low-cost nature of its devices. Humane AI’s now-discontinued Pin, in contrast, was sold at a hefty price of $499, so it wasn’t surprising that it ultimately went out of business. Rabbit is still around, but its R1 device costs four times as much as Bee’s wristband at $199. Bee has always made a big deal about its privacy, conscious that consumers are likely to have a lot of concerns about a device that records everything they say and tracks where they go. Bee needs to store some information, of course, so it can do its job as a personal assistant, but in its privacy policy, it explains that it doesn’t save or store user’s audio recordings, and it doesn’t use them for AI training. What it does do is save information that it learns about each user (like, a summary of what they talk about, the messages they receive and so on). But it notes that they can delete all of their data at any moment, should they choose to do so. Bee has also said it’s planning to update its device so it only records the voices of those who have consented to it, but it does not appear to do this currently. In addition, it has said it’s working on a feature that will allow users to set guidelines on what the device can and cannot record, based on different topics and locations. So the device would automatically switch itself off if the user ventures into their bedroom, for example. The startup is also looking to build a more powerful device capable of processing AI data internally rather than sending it to the cloud to be processed, which is something that will increase privacy for users. That said, it’s not clear if Bee will retain these policies and goals now that it’s set to be owned by Amazon. For its part, Amazon said in a statement that it “cares deeply” about user privacy and security. A spokesperson for the company told WinBuzzer that it has been a “strong steward of customer data” ever since it was founded, and pointed out that it has never been in the business of selling personal information to third parties. The spokesperson promised to work with Bee to give users “more control” over their devices. But it stopped short of saying it will adhere to its original policy of not storing audio data, so questions remain about how strong its privacy commitment really is. Amazon has previously stirred up controversy regarding its policies for the Amazon Ring security cameras, after sharing footage they recorded with law enforcement agencies without the owner’s consent. The acquisition is a strategic move for Amazon and suggests it’s a big believer in the idea that wearables will become the next big battleground for AI as it moves beyond the smartphone. It’s not the only technology giant that seems to think so either. Meta Platforms Inc. recently invested $3.5 billion in its smart glasses partner EssilorLuxottica SA, which has been working with a number of big name eyewear brands to popularize the concept of ambient intelligence. Meta previously partnered with Bausch & Lomb Corp. to develop the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and has already sold millions of those devices, illustrating the consumer appetite for intelligent wearables. It’s now building on that with its new line of Oakley Meta sunglasses aimed at athletes. OpenAI is also looking at wearable hardware as a foundation for AI, but it’s taking a different approach by acquiring io Products Inc., a somewhat secretive startup founded by former Apple Inc. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Prior to the acquisition, io was reported to be developing some kind of consumer AI device with no display, but it was never made clear exactly what form factor it would take. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman didn’t reveal much either, but instead articulated a vision of building “something beyond the legacy products we’ve been using for so long.” Bee does not represent Amazon’s first foray into wearable devices. In previously built a line of wristband health trackers called Halo, which were similar to Fitbit, but failed to make much of an impact and ultimately were discontinued it in 2023. It also sells Echo-branded smart glasses powered by its AI assistant Alexa. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

According to CNBC, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the Commission treats Ethereum like Bitcoin. He made it clear that securities laws won’t apply to the digital coin. He also noted that this view remains informal until a formal rule‑making is complete. In his words, “Similar to Bitcoin, the SEC has stated informally more than formally that ether is not a security.” That statement gave many investors relief and drove fresh buying by big firms.

Industry leaders joined to discuss which federal laws apply to crypto. Under Gary Gensler, the agency probed tokens for possible securities status, but never gave a straight answer on ether. Now Atkins says Ethereum is seen as a commodity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has long said Ether and Bitcoin are commodities. Yet uncertainty lingers around whether staking rewards count as income or tokens. Major companies are stacking up Ether on their balance sheets. BTCS, SharpLink Gaming and Gamesquare lead the pack. They’ve added millions of dollars’ worth of ETH in recent weeks. One startup, Ether Machine, plans a public debut backed by $1.6 billion in Ethereum capital. That figure shows how confident some treasury teams have become. ETF Flows Break Records And Prices Follow ETH‑focused funds have smashed their daily inflow records.

Traders say they see more room to grow if regulators stick to Atkins’ remarks. Applications for Ethereum staking ETFs remain on hold. BlackRock filed its proposal months ago, but the SEC has delayed any green light. Some companies worry that staking payouts could be deemed securities or income under tax laws.

Title: Why Does Raising the Retirement Age Hurt Young People?
URL: https://www.governance.fyi/p/why-does-raising-the-retirement-age
Time Published: 2025-07-23T00:27:20Z
Full Content:
A friend forwarded me a Twitter conversation he thought I would find interesting. The thread started innocuously enough. Lyman Stone was responding to Moses Sternstein analysis about the COVID "pull-forward" retirement wave: millions of people who retired earlier than planned during the pandemic, creating the "labor shortage" that drove wages and inflation up. "What I love about this is how clearly it reveals a fundamental problem: When retirees KEEP WORKING, the effect on career progress and wages for younger workers is... NEGATIVE! Which is why raising the retirement age will not balance Social Security as much as OASDI predicts." He made an interesting claim: "In fact, virtually all cuts to Social Security work this way: if you reduce Social Security, retirees keep working longer, employers are hesitant to fire senior workers, etc. One of many interactions OASDI does not actually entertain!" Stone had articulated something I'd been sensing but couldn't quite name. The standard rhetoric used to justify Social Security cuts and increase retirement ages completely ignores how those cuts destroy younger workers' careers. When someone asked him for solutions, his answer was blunt: "There's no solution except higher birth rates or rapid productivity growth." The idea of delayed retirement crushes young workers' advancement prospects seems like a no brainer (that somehow never brought up in debates on raising the retirement age of Social Security), but something else is still missing. This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share The Narrative: By every traditional measure, this should be a golden age for young workers. Unemployment (U3) sits at 4.1%. Business formation hit records with over 5.5 million new companies registered in 2023 alone. GDP growth remains robust. Young people are told they have options: get a college degree for white-collar work, or skip the debt and go into trades for "more secure" jobs with six-figure salaries, freedom to work for yourself, and hands-on skills that can't be outsourced to AI. The Reality: Workers under 40 report feeling trapped in "career purgatory." We are seeing a rise of long-term unemployment, declining hiring rates, and college graduates struggling to find work even in jobs that don't require degrees. Career advancement feels nearly impossible. Home ownership and family formation rates continue declining among young adults. If you are unemployed, you face Great Recession-level risks of long-term unemployment, and if you become long-term unemployed, the prospects for recovery are dire with a good chance it's just game over. The crisis now affects both paths young people were told to follow. Graduate unemployment has climbed above the overall unemployment rate for the first time on record. Male graduate unemployment rose from less than 5% to 7% over the past 12 months, completely erasing the college employability premium. Recently graduated young men are now unemployed at the same rate as their non-graduate counterparts. But the trades aren't offering refuge either. Despite the narrative about trade jobs being safer, building inspectors, electricians, and plumbers face unemployment rates of 7.2%, more than three times that of (formerly) entry-level office jobs like budget analysts. Trade roles dominate the bottom of rankings for best entry-level jobs, with welders, automotive mechanics, and boilermakers among the least promising career starters. After years of analysis blaming millennials' economic struggles on smartphone addiction and delayed maturity, observers like Jean Twenge now wonder why young people still aren't having families despite 'good' economic indicators, besides blaming it on the phones or whatever excuse to blame someone for not having economic stability. The disconnect suggests these commentators were looking in the wrong place all along. The disconnect suggests we're overlooking a crucial mechanism in how the modern economy actually works. Stone's insight provided the first clue. The COVID-19 pandemic accidentally created the largest unplanned retirement experiment in modern American history, providing crucial evidence for solving our mystery. During the COVID crisis, the Federal Reserve documented over 2.4 million "excess retirees": people who left the labor force above what pre-pandemic trends would have predicted. This wasn't simply early retirement by choice. The pull-forward was heavily concentrated among workers aged 55 and older without college degrees, particularly those in jobs that couldn't be performed remotely. These weren't the highly compensated professionals who could afford early retirement; they were often the most economically vulnerable workers, caught between virus exposure and business shutdowns. The sudden exodus created an immediate labor shortage that drove unprecedented wage growth, especially for the youngest workers. From the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023, nominal wages grew by an extraordinary 25% for workers aged 16-19 and 28% for those aged 20-24. This far outpaced the 18% growth for prime-age workers and the mere 13% for workers aged 55 and older. Young workers suddenly had bargaining power they hadn't experienced in decades. The "Great Resignation" saw millions of low-wage workers quit for better pay and conditions. Entry-level positions that had been scarce suddenly offered signing bonuses. But by 2023, the excess retirements had been absorbed back into expected demographic patterns. The dramatic wage growth slowed. The labor market "normalized" except for one puzzling feature: simultaneous low unemployment and low job growth. Who doesn’t get hired if there are no jobs? People currently unemployed, who are disproportionately under the age of 35. The youth labor market reveals the deeper structural problems. While overall unemployment appears benign, the youth unemployment rate in OECD member countries stood at 11.49% in 2024, consistently and significantly higher than that for the adult population, with December 2024, the OECD youth unemployment rate was 7.0 percentage points higher than the rate for workers aged 25 and over. Nine OECD countries reported youth unemployment rates above 20% as recently as April 2024. More troubling is the quality of available jobs. In the European Union, an analysis covering the period from 1985 to 2019 found that the wages of workers over the age of 55 grew nearly twice as fast as those of workers under 35, an increase in the age wage gap of 96%. A 2020 Brookings Institution analysis found that "44% of all U.S. workers (53 million people) earn low wages, with a median hourly pay of just $10.22." Critically, two-thirds of these low-wage workers are in their prime working years (25-54), and over half work full-time, year-round. Young people are disproportionately funneled into precarious employment. Across the EU, a staggering 43.3% of employed 15- to 24-year-olds were on fixed-term contracts in 2015, a figure more than three times higher than the 14.1% rate for the overall workforce. In countries like Slovenia, Poland, and Spain, the share of young workers on temporary contracts exceeded 70%. The COVID experiment revealed how retirement timing affects youth opportunities, but it was temporary. Stone's insight points to a more persistent problem: what happens when retirement is systematically delayed rather than accelerated, especially as countries are pushing for later and later retirements. To understand the full impact, we need to look inside individual companies. Fortunately, detailed firm-level studies provide concrete evidence of exactly how this mechanism works. Firm-level studies from Europe provide concrete evidence for Stone's thesis. When older workers delay retirement by just one year, the effects on their younger colleagues are immediate and severe: annual wage growth drops by 2.3% to 2.5%. More dramatically, the number of younger workers promoted into managerial roles falls by nearly 50%. For white-collar positions, promotions drop by about 21%. This isn't about overall employment levels. This is about the internal architecture of firms. When the person above you doesn't retire, your promotion doesn't happen. When promotions don't happen, wage growth stagnates. When wage growth stagnates across an economy, you get exactly what we're seeing: low unemployment that somehow doesn't feel like a tight labor market. The phenomenon even has a name: "occupational downgrading." Skilled young workers, unable to advance in their chosen fields, take lower-skill positions just to maintain employment. An engineering graduate becomes a technician. A business school graduate takes an administrative role. The human capital that should be driving productivity growth gets systematically underutilized. It accounts for why there are fewer management positions available and why career advancement has become so difficult, why wage growth has been disappointing despite low unemployment, and showcases a significant blind spot in Social Security policy modeling. This explains why young people struggle to advance in their careers, but it doesn't explain why they're also struggling to start careers. Something else is affecting career entry. Promotion bottlenecks shouldn't prevent companies, especially newer companies, from hiring new graduates for entry-level positions. Young workers should still be able to start their careers, even if advancement is slow (or lets be honest here, it’s non existent), because if an economy grows there should be demand for highly educated (cheaper and more disposable, increasingly on contract) workers and technicians. Instead, we are seeing the opposite trend This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share If the problem were purely demographic, we should see strong job creation at entry-level positions as businesses expand to meet demand with available younger workers. We should see new businesses forming to take advantage of all that skilled young talent being held back by promotion bottlenecks, especially at cheaper prices and destroyed expectations. The only ones hiring young workers right now are gig apps like DoorDash, Uber, and OnlyFans. These platforms were designed for extra cash, not full-time jobs. When college graduates are driving for Uber or delivering food as their main source of income, that shows how completely the traditional job market has broken down. Instead, we see the opposite. Between 2020 and 2023, new software company formation fell by 86% in the US, 89% in Israel, and 87% in the EU. Something is systematically choking off the creation of new companies, in addition to the current Fed Rates, that would typically absorb young workers eager to start their careers. As former investment banker Darin Soat of How Money Works has documented, this problem becomes clear when examining broader American market data. Despite record business formation in recent years, the number of publicly traded companies has collapsed. In 1996, 8,090 companies were publicly listed on American stock markets. Today, despite the economy being three times larger and markets handling seven times more capital, fewer than 4,000 companies trade publicly. This decline matters because new businesses are the primary engine of net job creation in developed economies. The Census Bureau shows a decades-long downward trend in the establishment entry rate, from around 14% in the early 1980s to about 10% in recent years. This decline in business dynamism directly translates into fewer new jobs per business, slower aggregate wage growth, and a less competitive marketplace. Startups/Scaleups/SMEs don't just create jobs. They create the right kinds of jobs for young workers at all levels of education, from accountants, marketers, customer service, etc etc . New companies typically hire younger workers who are willing to accept lower initial wages in exchange for rapid skill development, promotion opportunities, and equity stakes. Established companies prefer experienced workers for most positions and use their established hierarchies for advancement. When new business formation (besides sole props and gig contractors) collapses, it eliminates the primary mechanism by which young workers enter the professional workforce outside of service industries. Young workers face constraints from two directions: fewer promotion opportunities within existing firms (due to delayed retirement) and fewer alternative career paths at new firms (due to declining business formation). What's happening to all these businesses? They're getting bought before they can grow. The venture capital industry figured out it's more profitable to build companies specifically to sell them than to actually compete. M&A activity fundamentally disrupts workforces. When companies combine, "overlapping functions in areas like human resources, marketing, finance, and administration are deemed redundant," leading to job cuts that "disproportionately affect the employees of the acquired company."¹ More systemically, M&A increases employer market power. A detailed study of takeovers in the Netherlands found that even four years after an acquisition, workers from the target firm earned, on average, 2.8% less in labor market income and worked 7.3% fewer hours. Research on hospital mergers found that in deals that significantly increased market concentration, annual wage growth for skilled workers was suppressed by as much as 1.7 percentage points, i.e. eroding nearly a third of typical yearly wage growth. Just to show why companies acquire smaller companies, a study tracking over 35,000 drug development projects found that "about 6.4% of all acquisitions were killer acquisitions" (deals where incumbents buy competitors specifically to shut them down.) In the technology sector, the five largest tech firms made 175 acquisitions between 2015 and 2017 alone, and subsequently discontinued more than 60% of the acquired products or services. This creates what has been termed "kill zones" around dominant platforms. Potential entrepreneurs and their investors see little point in developing competing products, knowing they will likely be either copied or acquired and buried by the incumbent. The net result is an economy with fewer large employers, a dearth of new employers, and a suppressed rate of innovation. Private equity firms now control vastly more capital than in 2000, keeping promising companies private rather than letting them go public. Seven companies now control 34.1% of the entire S&P 500, up from just 16.2% for the top ten companies in 2015. The same three asset management firms (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) hold major stakes in competing companies across entire industries, using funds from pensions, both public and private, to consolidate control. When your biggest shareholders own all your competitors, competition becomes coordination. The traditional escape route for young workers (jumping to a growing startup) gets systematically eliminated through acquisition before those companies can scale and offer genuine career opportunities. A case study from American Affairs Magazine (Scale-Up Nation: The Role of IP-Transfer Restrictions in Israel’s Industrial Policy by Erez Maggor) provides evidence of this dynamic. Erez Maggor's analysis of Israel's industrial policy shows how the conflict between building domestic champions and optimizing for M&A exits affect young workers. Phase One: Building Industrial Capacity (1970s-1990s) From the 1970s to 1990s, Israel had a simple rule: if you take government money for research, you have to build your factories in Israel and keep your intellectual property here. The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) administered this system with strict conditions: "all products emerging out of OCS-funded projects must be manufactured exclusively in Israel, and the IP created during the R&D stage must not be transferred beyond the state's borders." As former chief scientist Dr. Yehoshua Gleitman explained: "We want to help nurture an industry that will employ workers." The system worked. Given Imaging, which pioneered endoscopy capsule technology, was required to establish manufacturing in Israel and eventually employed close to a thousand workers.⁵ Phase Two: The "Start-up Nation" Model (1990s-Present) Then in 1993, Israel launched Yozma, spending $100 million to create venture capital funds. The new rule was simple: build startups fast and sell them for maximum profit. In 2005, the R&D Law was reformed, lifting "the outright ban on the transfer of IP and replacing it with a fee." The results looked impressive. Israel became the "Start-up Nation" with record $15.8 billion in acquisition deals in 2024. But instead of building the next Intel in Israel, entrepreneurs built companies specifically to be bought by Intel. When Intel bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, Israel lost what could have been their first major car technology company. The Employment Impact The employment effects were dramatic. "For each employee of an Israeli high-tech manufacturer, two additional local jobs in nonmanufacturing industries are created. Each R&D center employee, on the other hand, creates only one-third of an additional job." Despite billions in exits, most Israelis didn't benefit from the tech boom. As Dan Breznitz observed: "During the years of extreme high-tech growth, the rest of the economy enjoyed no positive spillovers." Policy Choice, Not Market Forces Israel's experience proves these outcomes are policy choices, not natural market forces. The original OCS model successfully built industrial capacity through government intervention. The Yozma model destroyed it through different government intervention. Both were deliberate policy designs with completely different incentive structures. The same pattern emerges in American data. The collapse in publicly traded companies didn't happen because markets naturally consolidate. It happened because policy changes made private equity more attractive, merger review standards weakened, and tax policies favor quick exits over long-term building. When the same asset managers own competing firms across entire industries, it's the breakdown of competition rather than some market efficiency. The Israeli case study proves that what we call "market outcomes" are actually the result of specific government policy choices about how to structure incentives. Stone's retirement insight and the business formation collapse work together to create a perfect trap for young workers. The Pincer Movement Traditionally, workers blocked from promotion had an escape route: jump to a growing company with rapid advancement opportunities. But that safety valve no longer exists. The same forces that make advancement impossible within firms should create demand for ambitious young talent at new companies. Instead, new companies are systematically eliminated through acquisition before they can scale. The Result You can't advance at your current job because delayed retirement blocks promotions. You can't jump to a growing startup because they're designed for quick acquisition, not independent growth. You can't realistically start your own company because you lack the capital, connections, and safety net required, and even if you could, the venture capital system optimizes for exits, not competition. This explains the central paradox: how an economy can simultaneously produce impressive headline statistics (low unemployment, record business formation) while systematically destroying career pathways for an entire generation. We're measuring business creation while ignoring business elimination. We're tracking job numbers while missing job quality. The economy has been optimized for metrics that look good in policy reports while undermining the mechanisms young workers need to build successful careers. The solution requires practical action, not more measurement. There is a lot to discuss on things, both big and small, which is out of scope for this article. We do need to abandon failed approaches. We can't cut Social Security/public pensions, impose means testing, or raise retirement ages. These worsen promotion bottlenecks. We can't pretend what's happened to young people since 2008 is acceptable. On that note, Blanket forced retirement would be destructive, especially for founder-led companies, which could nasty long term side effects. There is no way getting out of this except by boosting birth rates and achieve rapid economic growth. Not the failed post-2008 methods of financial engineering or wishcasting, but genuine good governance especially in industrial, youth, and familu policies. If I am forced to give you a starting point, it would be with energy. As mattparlmer documents in "America Can Beat China on Energy," Chinese manufacturers pay $0.09/kWh while California companies pay $0.24/kWh. When electrons cost three times more on one side of an ocean, industrial capacity goes to the other side. A massive American energy buildout targeting $0.01/kWh electricity would create millions of jobs across skill levels: electricians, engineers, technicians, project managers. Real careers with advancement potential, not gig work. It requires a lot of political will, YIMBY reforms, the willingness to tax the upper crust until the Fed and bond markets are forced to be reasonable about cost of capital without giving them a tribute of unemployment, and stepping on a lot of other people’s toes. Erez Maggor's Israeli case study shows how government investment can build domestic industrial capacity instead of feeding acquisition targets. When Israel switched from building domestic companies to optimizing for startup exits, each high-tech manufacturer job was replaced by R&D jobs that created one-third as many supporting positions. The country got impressive acquisition headlines but lost the broad-based employment that builds middle-class prosperity. Palmer shows how energy infrastructure creates the fundamental input advantage needed for competitive manufacturing. We need antitrust enforcement to break up consolidated industries (read Matt Stoller and Basel Musharbash for more). We need industrial policy that creates genuine companies with career ladders, not startups designed for quick exits. For workers (white and blue collar) under 40, this helps determines whether you'll afford a house, start a family, or retire with dignity. This Substack is reader-supported.

Share I agree with the ultimate point that it’s all about finding a way to raise birth rates, and investing in clearly useful industries like energy buildout (and on-/friend-shoring those supply chains) makes a lot of sense. (Now if we can just convince the US government to not keep their heads in the sand…) Though on some specifics, RE why startups went off a cliff from 2020-2023, you mention the Fed rates as one factor but not fully explanatory of the decline - doesn’t that explain most of it? As an entrepreneur myself I hear from other founders that it’s hard to raise money these days, along with general worry about not being able to bounce back if they don’t make it - a riskier environment to make a startup. (I’m insulated from this since my company is bootstrapped, outside of the SV tech bubble, and taking a small business early profitability approach, but maybe that’s just another reflection of a more risk-averse approach to business creation 🤷) And I haven’t really heard of people seeing a lucrative acquisition as being a bad outcome for a startup that would drive them to not want to build one altogether (though I agree that it’s not great for the ecosystem of jobs and competition). After all if a company felt that they could get a better outcome by not taking an acquisition, they could just not take it, but they are (especially in this market). RE hiring young people for cheaper with the expectation of growth in the world of software, it seems like the age of LLMs isn’t helping, where an LLM can take a newbie to being a more productive but still junior engineer, whereas it takes a knowledgeable and motivated senior to being a 10x developer—which in my case means getting away with a much smaller and manageable team. Seems nobody wants to hire junior developers anymore, to the industry’s long-term detriment, though I think this has little to do with retirement ages or social security spending, at least in software. Anyway thanks for the post! Wouldn't removing the cap on earnings that are taxed for SS also help a lot for closing the funding gap, or should we just admit that the Congress will never ever go for that and pursue other options?

NEW YORK, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against AppLovin on March 5, 2025 with a Class Period from May 10, 2023 to March 26, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of AppLovin have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges.

The decline extends the stock's 17.47% fall over the past month from its all-time high of $298.99 on June 23, based on Yahoo Finance data. The firm now sets a price target of $130 for CRCL, a further 34% fall from its current trading price. “While we expected CRCL to rally into stablecoin legislation, crypto investors typically ‘sell the news’ after highly anticipated events,” analysts at Compass Point wrote in their downgrade memo. “As such, we expect CRCL to retrace some of its recent rally after the GENIUS act was signed into law on 7/18.” The GENIUS Act marks America's first major piece of crypto legislation, creating a clear framework for the issuance and trading of stablecoins, or tokens pegged to the value of fiat currencies like that of the U.S. Dollar. While Compass Point analysts believe Circle's stablecoin–USDC–can play a pivotal role in the financial system moving forward, it believes that items like increased stablecoin competition from banks and fintech companies might be a detriment in the second half of 2025. “We expect more mainstream fintechs and banks to announce competing stablecoins in 2H25, primarily through white-labeling and/or M&A,” the Compass Point analysts said. “Many mainstream businesses have wider distribution networks than CRCL, particularly within payments.” Among others, Charles Schwab’s CEO hinted at the firm’s interest in its own stablecoin last week, following similar considerations from Citi Bank and JP Morgan. Furthermore, the analysts highlighted Federal rate cuts, waning retail interest, and the details of new revenue share agreements as potential negative catalysts for the CRCL share price. “We reach our $130 price target (PT) by applying a 25x multiple on our 2030E EBITDA forecast while applying a 15% annual discount rate. With CRCL trading at 106x our 2026E EBITDA forecast, we don’t believe investors are valuing the stock on near-term earnings,” the analysts said. Circle completed its IPO in early June, raising $1.1 billion at an offering of $31 per share. The stock nearly quadrupled in a single day of trading, outperforming the public debuts of other notable companies, including Meta, Airbnb, and Robinhood in the process.

Title: The risks and rewards of tokenization as crypto heavyweights push for it

As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.” Travel like a local with Nomad eSIM!

There is no inherent value. And worse they allow criminals to buy and sell things up to and including murders with funds that are most often untraceable. Honest people do not need crypto currencies and it is disgusting to see governments promoting them. Any polly who promotes them should be voted out of office at the next election. Digital/Blockchain coming, modern financial systems which greatly increase their efficiency, including speed, quality of data and eliminating MANY unnecessary intermediary $cockroaches Most successful companies in world and Govts. rapidly converting their IT systems to blockchain, because the legacy systems are too slow, stupid and $corrupt. Anyone who believes banking should rely on traditional mainframe tech of 50 years ago clearly no clue about the world of innovation and productivity in digital tech! An ounce of silver a token? We know the answer… Anyone who believes banking should rely on traditional mainframe tech of 50 years ago clearly no clue about the world of innovation and productivity in digital tech! Sigh. Do you really want your personal financial data running on millions of computers you or your bank have no control over? What happened to Etherium where hackers found a weakness in their blockchain software to exploit should make you think twice about the notional virtues of Blockchain. Oh yes, Blockchain is also very slow, and the more participating computers in the Blockchain the slower it becomes because they all have to agree on every transaction. https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/risks-and-unintended-consequences-blockchain Most successful companies in world and Govts. rapidly converting their IT systems to blockchain, because the legacy systems are too slow, stupid and $corrupt. damn lol... blockchain is simply a distributed ledger and is in no way going to replace "IT Systems". However tokenization is about the only truly useful idea for crypto. Stable coins will be replaced by CBDCs and bitcoin will become the little engine that never really could, especially once the hurdles are overcome with quantum computing. The money invested there is not anymore available in the real economy. That is the problem here. But it also shows the real intentions behind. De-industrialization and slowing everything down, especially consumption, by aqueezing the money out of people and suck it in like a vacuum cleaner into the digital, virtual world of crypto, tokens or let's also add game consoles, chatbots, virtual girlfriends and such. Because the developped economies are shrinking and aging, all the big money, saved, earned or inherited, must be drawn out of the masses. That is the development behind. And to be honest, there isn't much left to invest or consume in real life, don't you agree? Big cars dying, brand companies closing, no more smoking, no drinking, no real entertainment, all contacts with the other gender nearly prohibited, powerful amplifiers for listening music have gone , replaced by some toy players and earbuds, travelling is also too dangerous, from wars, terror or gangs and drugs and knife wielders still not speaking. So, what is left for us for spending haed work earned money? Nothing, but some of those virtual investments, cryptos, tokens, whatever. Well, I don't like it and consider it scam, but anyway, enjoy it, there(s nothing else left for you all, especially when still in younger generations.

In the ongoing bull market cycle, Bitcoin has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency becomes a crucial global asset sought after persistently by prominent figures and companies worldwide. Many of these figures and companies are driven by the fact that BTC could serve as a strategic solution to real problems in the financial sector, making it a valuable asset. As local financial instability and economic uncertainty engulf many parts of the world, Bitcoin, often considered as “Digital Gold,” is constantly being pushed into the spotlight as a potential buffer against these negative conditions. This implies that the digital asset is becoming extremely popular among investors looking for protection from inflation and currency devaluation due to its decentralized structure and limited supply. Larry Fink, the chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the largest asset management company, BlackRock, is the latest prominent figure to acknowledge this notion around the flagship asset. The BlackRock CEO made the claims in an interview on Bloomberg. Such claims and statements from well-known figures in the financial sector are an indication of how Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold is now compelling than ever. Fink considers Bitcoin the ideal choice of asset when one is frightened of the debasement of currencies or the economic and political stability of a country. His statement underscores the chairman’s robust trust in BTC’s potential as a notable and reliable store of value during negative periods. According to the CEO, BTC is an internationally based instrument that will overcome and address local fears. As a result, he is confident and believes in the utilization of the crypto king as a key instrument during economic uncertainty. In the event that BTC is generally considered as a strategic internationally based instrument, Fink claims it could be a proper hedge against hope securities and equities. After sharing his insights on Bitcoin’s reputation as an inflation hedge, Fink offered his bullish prediction on the digital asset. The CEO is confident that BTC’s value might soar to untouched territory between $500,000 $700,000 in the foreseeable future. However, this could likely take place if every individual or business allocates 2% to 5% of their capital to BTC investments. Fink noted that this should be a major discussion in the sector as macroeconomic turmoil lingers. Tom Lee, the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also weighed in on Bitcoin’s price potential, predicting a rally to unprecedented levels. In the interview, Lee asserted that a $200,000 to $250,000 per BTC is still reasonable, given that this price range is equivalent to 25% of the entire Gold market. Acknowledging its status as Digital Gold, the chairman believes that BTC should be valued at $1 million if it follows the path of gold. While this forecast may seem over optimistic, Lee is just one of many who believe the asset could reach this value in the next few years. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Texas Instruments (TXN) shares dropped in extended trading Tuesday as the company issued a soft profit forecast. The analog chipmaker said it expects third-quarter earnings of $1.36 and $1.60 per share, below the consensus of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha at the midpoint. Texas Instrument's revenue outlook of $4.45 billion to $4.8 billion came roughly in line with Street estimates. Texas Instruments shares dropped over 8% in extended trading following the release. The stock was up close to 15% for 2025 through Tuesday’s close. For the second quarter, Texas Instruments reported revenue of $4.45 billion, up 16% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $1.3 billion, or $1.41 per share, rose from $1.13 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the year-ago quarter, also topping estimates. The company's semiconductors are used in a wide variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, vehicles, and satellites. Texas Instruments has said it counts Apple (AAPL), Ford (F), Nvidia (NVDA), SpaceX, and Medtronic (MDT) among those using its products. Last month, the company announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. chip production, including on seven facilities in Texas and Utah.

Title: Debris and Collisions? SpaceX Flags AST SpaceMobile's Satellites As Safety Risk

SpaceX has a new complaint against competitor AST SpaceMobile, warning that the company’s "tennis-court-sized" satellites pose a collision risk that could result in dangerous space debris. On Tuesday, SpaceX sent a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission, urging the agency to closely scrutinize AST’s proposal to operate 248 satellites in Earth's orbit to power cellular connectivity for everyday smartphones. AST already has five “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, each measuring 700 square feet. However, the company has plans to launch dozens of second-generation BlueBirds that are about three times larger and offer even stronger cellular connectivity. A prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch in the coming weeks, following FCC approval. But in Tuesday’s letter, SpaceX claims that AST’s plan to safely orbit the proposed BlueBird constellation contains “critical gaps and inconsistencies” that raise questions about whether the satellites can avoid collisions in space while preventing debris from falling toward Earth. “Authorizing AST to launch its proposed spacecraft without resolving these issues would be irresponsible, potentially subjecting all other operators in LEO (low-Earth orbit) to unnecessary risk,” SpaceX wrote. The critical gaps include AST allegedly “underestimating” the collision risk of the company’s BlueBird satellites once they’ve been retired and “massively undercounting the number of objects it will need to avoid in its orbits.” In addition, SpaceX says AST’s application neglects to cover whether the satellites contain any “ferromagnetic components.” That’s a potential problem because AST plans on retiring its satellites by allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere. “These components are typically among the most challenging for demisability, meaning they are the most likely to survive re-entry and cause risk to human life,” SpaceX says, later adding: “AST routinely brags about the outlandish size of its satellites. But these large satellites may dramatically increase the risk of all operations in their orbits and below.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company has previously accused Elon Musk of using "bullying” tactics to try to derail the competition. SpaceX has fired back, alleging that AST has its own anticompetitive efforts. Tuesday's letter underscores the simmering rivalry between SpaceX and AST. Both companies are working to offer satellite services to everyday smartphones while trying to lobby the FCC to rule in their favor. However, the dispute also highlights the safety measures around today's growing satellite constellations. For example, SpaceX has been retiring and de-orbiting hundreds of Starlink satellites in recent months by letting them burn up in the atmosphere. The satellites are designed to disintegrate completely, but in some rare instances, they have caused debris to fall to the planet. In February, the company released a report that estimated the chances of a V2 Mini Starlink satellite causing a human casualty due to falling debris were less than "1 in 100 million." In the meantime, SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service is preparing to officially launch tomorrow through T-Mobile. AST, on the other hand, is aiming to kick off its own beta program early next year through partners AT&T and Verizon.

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. There aren’t many good things to have come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, but a new study of finance professionals from accounts payable software maker AvidXchange pinpoints one of them: Businesses increased their readiness for the unexpected. As businesses navigate an uncertain financial future, two-thirds say they are more prepared to handle it now than five years ago, when many normal flows of global commerce were disrupted by the virus. Since the pandemic, companies have been investing more in strategic financial technology, including for automation, operational effectiveness, forecasting and productivity. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said technology implemented during the pandemic is helping them now, with seven in 10 reporting that technology is at least very important to their ability to continue to respond to market changes. Just having the technology available doesn’t mean that finance professionals are confident in what is coming next, however. The vast majority—86%—are concerned about the state of the economy, and half have deeper concerns about a potential recession. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable financial policy, punctuated by threats of high tariffs that are often delayed and revised, has made planning difficult. Nearly half of all companies are reevaluating their budgets and discretionary spending. Three in 10 are using scenario planning and financial modeling to prepare for a range of outcomes. So far, just over half have made moderate changes to their forecasts because of impending tariffs, but about a quarter that have been minimally impacted so far are monitoring them closely. Close to a fifth—17%—said the tariff threat has significantly disrupted planning and required major adjustments. This survey was taken in late spring—April to May—and many of the proposed tariffs seemed to loom much more in the immediate future. That effective date has shifted through the months, and is now set for August 1. However, one thing that hasn’t changed since this survey was conducted is the unknown nature of the immediate financial picture, which has been a consistent fog over finance departments since January. When companies are being prudent about their finances, one area where they often make cuts is personnel. However, many companies fail to share relevant people data between managers, HR and the finance department, leading companies to cut employees based on salaries alone—a strategy that sometimes will lead to vital knowledge and capabilities being cut, and ultimately losing more money in the long run. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about why companies need to share data to make better informed staffing cuts in difficult times. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget.

Looking at the stock market, the U.S. economy appears to be making fast progress with nothing in its way. The S&P 500 shattered records with two all-time highs in the last week—Monday and Thursday—while the Nasdaq also set a daily record on Monday. Optimism in technology, especially AI, is buoying the markets, with Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Verizon, Qualcomm and Broadcom leading Monday’s rally. Analysts are mixed on whether the rally will continue, with strategists at Goldman Sachs, Wells and Fargo projecting more growth this year. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase and Evercore ISI are projecting a decrease. Positive economic data has helped boost the markets. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Additionally, 83% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Alphabet and Tesla, two of the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies, will report their earnings later this week. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to mitigate the majority of the impact when it comes, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that a distressing sign is emerging from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards. President Donald Trump holds up the just-signed GENIUS Act with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) applauding next to him. The U.S. has regulations in place to govern some types of cryptocurrency. Last week, President Trump signed legislation to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. The new laws put guidelines in place for banks and other entities to issue stablecoins. The new law has been hailed as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Analysts told him that with regulations in place, there will be more momentum to establish and invest in cryptocurrency, both for individual investors and corporate entities. And several companies are looking into the issue. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins as a way to circumvent traditional payment systems. With the ink barely dry on the new law, the earliest impacts have come in the form of runaway valuations on Bitcoin and Ethereum stablecoins. Prices for these tokens have skyrocketed over the last week. Two other Republican-backed bills that would provide more regulation on the industry are currently before the Senate. They would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and divide regulatory jurisdiction for digital assets between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill—dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act—the 50% tax deduction on food and drinks in the office expires on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but the perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work make them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it may be challenging for companies to preserve a non-deductible employee perk. Andrea Derler, Visier Principal, Research and Customer Value. When it’s time to cut costs, financial leaders typically begin by looking at a company’s largest cost center: personnel. But the CFO’s office and the personnel department don’t always have the same data—down to agreeing on total employee counts—and the information the CFO has is usually based on numbers and location, missing important context like job functions and company plans for further growth. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about how everyone in the company can align on its workforce. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. In an ideal business situation, what kind of access would the CFO have of personnel data? Derler: To begin with, what type of data does the organization have? How is it currently processed and integrated? I’m exaggerating here, but she’s probably not going to be interested in seeing a spreadsheet with 300,000 employees. Ideally, it’s in a system where it’s easily accessible to the C-suite. The better it is integrated and actually prepared for results and insights, the easier it becomes. These people don’t have time to play around with the system for half an hour to get to one insight. What’s our headcount? Where’s the diversity in terms of women in leadership positions? How does our projected headcount actually affect our ability to meet our targets next quarter? That needs to be really easily integrated. In terms of the detail and what they see, hopefully they’ll work with the relevant IT and CHRO teams to understand: Can I have access to this and that because I need it for this and that? The collaborative aspect of all of these decisions is increasingly high nowadays because it’s technically possible: Understanding and negotiating access to certain data points and certain business units is really a collaborative effort. There’s a basic set of metrics that are always relevant. We need to know who is going, who is coming in the organization, particularly for workforce planning. You always need to know who is where. Engagement may not be the most important one for the CFO because it’s further away from proof to say it really affects the bottom line. Closer to that would be how many people do we have? Do we have the right skills, and how is it going to affect our projected revenue next year? What are some of the bigger things that go wrong in companies because the CFO doesn’t necessarily have access to good data from HR? We have a massive data set of [about] more 30 million employee records of global industry data. We look at that data constantly. Two years ago, we studied layoffs—reduction in force, turnover, resignation. Most companies have some type of a number we can see in our data. Then I interviewed six CHROs to understand what the decision making process around layoff positions look like? If there’s a very short term calculation: I’m going to save this much if I let 10% go in the next three months, what’s sometimes missing? Sure, you have the cost savings in the short term, but what’s sometimes neglected is what the actual long-term cost is. I’m going to let go 10% now because I think we don’t need them anymore, and currently I‘m going to have to save some costs. Sometimes, what’s not happening is thinking ahead 12 months. We want to grow again after the difficult economic times. Now, I’m going to have to rehire individuals or find new replacement employees. We know that hiring new employees is generally much more expensive than keeping existing employees and helping them either internally to find different roles or reskill them. There’s a lot of academic research and also industry research that found that layoffs most of the time are not really financially making sense because the planning capabilities don’t always exist. If the CFO knew how much it’s going to cost their company to rehire, knowing it may cost a lot more, giving us another headache in two years time, [they may advise against it]. They had only the financial data and said, ‘Oh man, we are spending way too much on wages. We’re going to have to make some cost savings.’ That’s for lack of data integration. That’s for lack of the ability to collaborate and look at the same data set and do thorough scenario planning, very much to the detriment, not only of the employees who are being let go, but even financially, it doesn’t make sense most of the time. What advice would you give to a CFO who wants to make the best financial decisions in the long run for their company when it comes to personnel, and feels like they need to have more access to information? The first thing, very practically, I would recommend that they would go to their counterparts— CHRO or IT—and find out how solidly set up they are from a technology and analytics perspective in terms of what do we have? How are we set up? Are we still working on spreadsheets? What questions can you answer for me here and now—not tomorrow, next week, not in two months, because we still have to do all the calculations manually. That would be an expectation that the CFO can reasonably have, to say, ‘Well, if we want to make good decisions, that’s what we need.’ Secondly, gauge the appetite. If it’s not in place, make a business case for it and say, ‘I will be able to make more solid financial decisions if I have the solid HR data behind me. I can make a decision faster and be more agile. That’s a big selling point. Currently, with all that’s happening in the economy, it’s very hard to plan ahead. You need agility and the ability to look something up today. Find out what’s in place. If nothing’s in place, what’s the appetite, and who are the stakeholders that I need to engage with within the company? The third important task that they could do by themselves is list what’s missing for me right now in terms of people data. These are the table stakes five questions that I need to be able to answer so I can, as a CFO, make meaningful decisions, or help at least advise the board or others on those decisions. Businesses do want to make money, but your success and longevity may depend on your ability to do something else: create value for your customers. Here are some ways to make a shift away from pure profit, but possibly a better market position.

Title: Institutions Decreasing Real Estate Purchases

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/22/2025 9:41:35 AM PDT by delta7 Investors continue to snap up residential properties, as real estate has evolved into an investment class of its own. New reports show that between 2020 and 2023, investors were responsible for 18.5% of home purchases. In the first three months of 2025, investors composed 27% of all residential properties, marking the highest share in half a decade, according to BatchData. High mortgage rates, coupled with high property values, have caused many would-be buyers to reconsider their purchases. Investors have fewer constraints, leading to the purchase of 265,000 residential properties during Q1, or a 1.2% YoY rise. However, we are seeing a decrease in institutional investments in real estate. The big money is not looking at real estate in this environment. Although investors accounted for 1.2 million homes in 2024, only 20% of the 86 million single-family homes in America are investor-owned. Mom-and-pop investors who own between one and five homes purchased 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, with those owning between six and ten properties securing 5% of the market. Institutions owning 1,000 or more properties account for only 2.2% of investor-owned homes. Purchasing real estate amid record-low rates was a no-brainer for investors, and institutions in particular, who had the liquidity to outbid competitors with cash offers. As interest rates rise, the cost of financing becomes prohibitive even for institutions. Institutions rely on leverage to enhance returns, and when borrowing costs rise, the math simply doesn’t work anymore. Real estate is an illiquid asset. In a world moving toward capital controls and rising geopolitical tensions, institutions are reallocating toward assets with more mobility. Capital is no longer looking at real estate as a long-term store of value. It’s moving into tangible assets that are more liquid—commodities, energy, gold, and equities. The available real estate inventory is at its highest level since the pandemic, but the sector has become stagnant as homes sit on the market for far longer. So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

As interest rates rise, the cost of financing becomes prohibitive even for institutions. Institutions rely on leverage to enhance returns, and when borrowing costs rise, the math simply doesn’t work anymore. Real estate is an illiquid asset. In a world moving toward capital controls and rising geopolitical tensions, institutions are reallocating toward assets with more mobility. Capital is no longer looking at real estate as a long-term store of value. It’s moving into tangible assets that are more liquid—commodities, energy, gold, and equities. The available real estate inventory is at its highest level since the pandemic, but the sector has become stagnant as homes sit on the market for far longer. So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

So the circling sharks back away . . . waiting for the decline of capital gains taxes. “You still have to find ethical renters.” Ethical renters still have to find ethical Landlords. There are lots of reliable working folks that want to rent a safe home, in a safe neighborhood. They aren’t rich but can afford a fair rent. They can’t afford to buy, nor the “First Time Investor” keystone markup that many Landlords are seeking. Longtime rental-property owners know the value and the kind of stable income stream a quality tenant brings to Real Estate investments. Have had some 15+ year tenants. Every area and deal is unique. Some markets like Austin have already corrected from their 2021-2022 highs. Especially with the national home builders in that market. Places in Florida are also correcting from their Covid boom highs. This is also having a direct effect on the northeast and upper midwest. There are no enough houses in New England and around Chicago for the demand. Places like here in NH continue to be a sellers market. There is just not enough supply of homes. Prices continue to go up slowly 6-8% annually. Manchester/Nashua, NH is one hottest markets in the country. Places like Chicago there are not enough houses to keep up with demand. Yet, BOOM towns like Denver. SLC, Phoenix, Boise are correcting. Even Dallas/Fort Worth is no longer the biggest volume new home start market in the country. Houston has now taken the number one spot. NYC is now the #3 spot for starts/permits in the country. Lots of people that moved during covid are moving back to where they came from. Maybe they weren’t cut out for TX & FL summers. Phoenix and LA including the valley are still growing, but not as fast as they were. These and the Florida markets are where the big investors like Blackrock and Invitation homes have backed off. The big investors think real estate is technically overpriced. That is why they are not buying. Some are selling or have sold already in places like Austin. Orlando is now in the top ten housing market in the country. That is because a lot of people are moving from the beach inland. Most people cannot afford the insurance on the coasts of Florida anymore.

Title: China Threatens to Block $23B Port Deal Without Cosco Stake: Report

By Glenn Taylor The Chinese government is reportedly threatening to nix the $23 billion port deal that has become a key front in its ongoing geopolitical tug-of-war with the U.S. Under the proposed sale, Hong Kong-based port operator CK Hutchison Holdings would hand ownership of more than 40 ports worldwide to a consortium including Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and BlackRock. But according to a Thursday report from the Wall Street Journal, China wants to block the acquisition if its leading ocean carrier, Cosco Shipping, is not included in the deal. The deal includes the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal in Panama, both of which sit on the opposite sides of the Panama Canal. China has had the deal under antitrust review since March, delaying the official approval of the sale. The Panamanian government also still needs to approve the acquisition. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is pushing for Cosco to be an equal partner and shareholder of the ports alongside both BlackRock and MSC, which is the world’s largest container shipping company, the report said. Related Stories Topics European Port Congestion is 'Here to Stay' Through 2025 Footwear White House Confirms 19 Percent Shoe Tariff Rate With Indonesia: Are China, Cambodia Next? Talks between the current parties in the deal are expected to continue through July 27, which is the end of the 145-day exclusive negotiation period. Cosco would not be able to be part of the talks until that period ends. While BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison are reportedly open to Cosco taking a stake in the deal, U.S. lawmakers don’t share the same feeling. When the deal was first announced in March, it was seen as a major victory for the Trump administration, which has been seeking to rid the Panama Canal of any alleged Chinese influence. The president has claimed that the U.S. must “take back” the canal as part of his protectionist, “America First” rhetoric, so including a Chinese buyer in the sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports would further inflame the situation again. The U.S. congressional committee on China remains concerned as Cosco floats in the background of the mega ports deal. After the Wall Street Journal article published Thursday, Chairman John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) of the House Select Committee on China made his letter to a top Panamanian official public. The letter expresses alarm that CCP-directed entities could be included as part of a transaction involving port concessions managed by CK Hutchison, which Moolenaar said would pose a direct threat to the national security of both Panama and the U.S. “The inclusion of Cosco—or any other Chinese company—in port operations or control along the canal would represent an unacceptable risk to the national security of both our nations,” writes Chairman Moolenaar in the letter. The letter mentioned Cosco’s inclusion earlier this year to the Department of Defense’s list of Chinese military assets. Conversely, Chinese President Xi Jinping was reportedly angered with CK Hutchison when it announced the port sale to Western interests. The quick response saw multiple state-owned media firms criticize the deal before the China’s top antitrust body opened its probe. Additionally, reports surfaced that the CCP told state-owned businesses to freeze any impeding deals with Hutchison or other businesses linked to its controlling shareholder, the family of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Panama has always maintained that it has full control over the canal, despite Trump’s claims. But the country is having its own doubts over the deal, even as it currently stands without Cosco’s involvement. Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, administrator at the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), said the concentration of terminal operators in one area would be inconsistent with the canal’s neutrality. This is on top of Panama’s Supreme Court already reviewing whether the Hutchison sale is constitutional, and the country’s government insisting that the port operator owes it roughly $300 million in previously unpaid fees stemming from its prior contract. China has been able to sway shipping deals in the past. In 2014, its antitrust regulator shot down the proposed P3 Network that included MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM. That vessel-sharing alliance would have combined the top three container shipping companies by total container capacity at the time, but worried China that it would give the companies too much control over global trade routes. The P3 Network had already been approved by American and European regulators. The failed attempt at the new network led to the creation of the 2M alliance between MSC and Maersk in 2015, which lasted a decade until the agreement expired to kick off 2025.

Title: Mexico Biologicals Market to Worth Over US$ 2,268.76 Million by 2033 | Astute Analytica

July 22, 2025 11:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mexico biologicals market was valued at US$ 853.46 million in 2024 and is expected to US$ 2,268.76 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 12.16% during the forecast period 2025–2033. In January 2021, the Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (SADER) enacted NOM-232-SSA1, the first standard that formally classifies microbial consortia as low-risk crop-protection inputs. The rule trims dossier review time from twenty-six months to fourteen and cancels duplicate ecotoxicity trials when strains already appear in the national biofertilizer catalogue. This acceleration has lured mid-sized formulators from Jalisco and Guanajuato while global players such as Koppert and Certis have opened dedicated compliance desks in Mexico City. Their joint pilot with the state of Sinaloa moved a Bacillus-based seed treatment from bench to commercial acreage in only nineteen months, a turnaround previously unthinkable. Early field data indicated strong nematode suppression and yield stability. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/mexico-biologicals-market Regulatory momentum rippled across the Mexico biologicals market as public laboratories partnered with CONACYT to fast-track indigenous strain discovery. By 2024, the National Center for Genetic Resources in Guanajuato had sequenced 1,300 endophyte isolates from chili, avocado, and maize, creating a public database that companies can license for under US$ 6,000 per strain. This access model lowers entry barriers for start-ups while building a pipeline aligned with residue ceilings demanded by export customers. Combined with the sanitary import protocol for Guatemalan biostimulants, these measures position the Mexico biologicals market for a diversified product mix, shorter innovation cycles, and stronger traceability that resonates in domestic and North American supermarkets. Key Finding in Mexico Biologicals Market Domestic Production Capacity Expands To Meet Growing Biostimulant Demand Nationwide Industrial fermentation capacity in the Bajío corridor has grown rapidly since 2022, driven by investments from both established agrochemical contract manufacturers and bio-centric newcomers. AP Chemicals commissioned a 40,000-litre multi-strain plant in Querétaro in mid-2023, followed six months later by Rising Earth’s 18,000-litre facility in Irapuato dedicated to Trichoderma and Azotobacter production. Combined, these two sites can annually supply roughly 5.6 million liters of concentrated broth, enough to treat around 1.4 million hectares of staple crops under typical dilution rates. The plants operate under ISO 14698 cleanroom guidelines and feature inline flow cytometry, enabling real-time colony counts that reduce batch rejection to under five per year. Local sourcing of inputs such as molasses and soybean hydrolysate has improved cost predictability for the Mexico biologicals market, trimming formulation expense by roughly US$ 0.12 per liter versus 2020. Fermenters now sign forward contracts with Veracruz cane mills, ensuring a steady carbon source even during export-driven spikes. Domestic glassworks have also scaled amber growler production, cutting package lead time to twelve days. These gains let formulators quote distributors fixed prices for a whole season, a pledge once impossible. Because price swings were cited by eight of ten tomato growers as the main adoption barrier, steadier pricing should boost the Mexico biologicals market in greenhouse hubs across Sonora and Baja California. Key Crop Segments Reveal Adoption Drivers And Bottlenecks By Region Sinaloa’s export-oriented tomato and bell-pepper complexes remain early adopters of microbial pesticides, accounting for 31.5 million square meters of greenhouse area under at least one biological program in 2024. Growers there often sign integrated pest-management contracts that bundle insect parasitic fungi with pheromone traps and monitoring services; this services-first approach shortens learning curves and keeps residue levels below US FDA tolerances. In contrast, Michoacán’s avocado orchards favor biofertility solutions: more than 4,200 orchards now inject mycorrhizal blends through drip lines, targeting improved phosphorous availability on the region’s volcanic soils. This practice correlates with a 240-gram increase in average fruit weight when combined with reduced urea. Adoption inside the cereal belt is slower yet gaining. Pilot work by CIMMYT and Yara on 7,800 hectares of irrigated maize in Guanajuato showed that replacing half the synthetic nitrogen with Azospirillum cultures saved 9,300 metric tons of urea in the 2023 cycle. Still, inconsistent state extension support hampers diffusion. Farmers in Tamaulipas cited limited cold-chain capacity for liquid inoculants and uncertain shelf life as main concerns. To address this gap, the Mexico biologicals market now offers dry talc carriers that tolerate transit temperatures. The first commercial shipment reached Matamoros in April 2024, signaling a logistics fix that could double the Mexico biologicals market exposure to cultivated hectares within two seasons. Technological Alliances With Universities Boost Strain Discovery And Field Validation The Center for Applied Microbiology at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL) operates a 6,000-isolate culture bank of desert-adapted actinomycetes. In 2023 the lab signed memoranda with three private firms granting shared IP on strains that reach commercial registration, replacing upfront licensing with milestone royalties. Under this framework, Streptomyces isolate NLS-211 suppressed Sclerotinia lesions in lettuce microplots by nearly four-fifths and triggered a 35-hectare pilot in Celaya financed by a local distributor. Such collaboration accelerates translational research and gives graduate students exposure to industrial QA protocols. The initiative is being closely watched within the Mexico biologicals market. Technology transfer is no longer confined to wet labs. UANL and software start-up AgriMetrics are building a machine-learning platform that ingests 40,000 historical agronomic records from INIFAP and generates predictive heat maps for biopesticide efficacy under different stress profiles. Field technicians use a mobile app to upload geo-tagged images; the algorithm returns optimized spray intervals within five minutes, shrinking sampling costs by one third. Early adopters include a 2,400-hectare citrus cooperative in Veracruz that reports a drop of one-fifth in copper hydroxide usage after just two cycles. As this digital layer scales, the Mexico biologicals market gains performance datasets that can be cited during SAGARPA reviews, thereby reducing uncertainty for investors and further reinforcing credibility across the Mexico biologicals market for commercial rollout. Retail Channel Evolution Enhances Farmer Access To Verified Biologicals Nationwide Historically, biologicals in Mexico moved through the same wholesalers that distribute synthetic agrochemicals, leaving farmers exposed to counterfeit risk. Since late 2022, specialized “bio-corners” inside 320 of Grupo Tornel’s ag-retail outlets have started to change that dynamic. Each corner features a trained crop advisor, chilled cabinets, and a QR-code system that links every bottle to COFEPRIS registration data. During the 2023 spring campaign, 48,000 scans were recorded, with roughly three in five scans executed by growers under 35—evidence that traceability tools resonate with a younger demographic. Retailers report a reduction of about two-fifths in expired inventory because digital stock monitoring triggers automated restocking. Suppliers, in turn, receive data during scans. E-commerce is also reshaping the Mexico biologicals market. Agrobify, farm-input marketplace, added temperature-controlled fulfilment in three cities, enabling next-day delivery of living inoculants to 14,200 postal codes. Average basket size in its biologicals category reached US$ 146 during the 2024 winter vegetable season, overtaking foliar fertilizer sales. Importantly, digital platforms integrate peer reviews; Bacillus bio-fungicides with four-plus-star ratings now sell out within 72 hours of listing. This feedback loop rewards manufacturers and pressures laggards to improve quality. As rural broadband expands under the federal Internet Para Todos program, the Mexico biologicals market stands to capture a share of online procurement, tightening the link between field data and purchase decisions. Investment Patterns Shift Toward Low-Toxicity Portfolios Amid Consumer Health Concerns Venture and strategic capital flowed decisively toward biologicals in 2023, with nine deals disclosed by the Mexican Stock Exchange related to microbial or botanical inputs. While ticket sizes remain modest—median US$ 4.8 million—more than half of the investors previously held positions in synthetic pesticide producers. Their pivot follows supermarket chains Soriana and Chedraui updating supplier charters to limit detectable organophosphate residues by 2026. Consequently, SPGG Holdings divested a 25-year-old atrazine plant and reinvested proceeds into a new fermentation hall in Monterrey designed for Bacillus lipopeptide production. Investors cite stronger gross margins, at 34 pesos per liter, owing to premium positioning and lower regulatory overhead. Analysts project reallocation trends for rounds. ESG scoring frameworks are also shaping valuations across the Mexico biologicals market. Banorte’s sustainable agriculture fund now applies a “toxicity haircut” in its discounted cash-flow models, reducing the terminal value of molecules flagged by WHO hazard classes. By contrast, dossiers backed by greenhouse re-entry intervals under four hours gain a 0.6 multiple uplift. This shift pushed a Guadalajara-based biocontrol start-up to reach financial close in just eleven weeks, a national record for ag-inputs. As auditors demand risk audits from food exporters, access to capital is poised to favor assets that reduce chemical load. For prospective entrants, aligning projects with these screens can unlock faster traction inside the Mexico biologicals market. Regenerative Agriculture Certifications Shape Procurement Choices For Major Food Exporters The surge of regenerative agriculture labels—RegenerAção, ROC Mexico, and Bayer’s PRO Carbono—has begun to influence input procurement at the field level. Export packers sourcing berries and limes for Costco and Lidl increasingly require proof of soil-health metrics such as particulate organic matter and microbiome diversity. Certification auditors now request invoices listing active microbial species and registration numbers, effectively embedding transparency requirements into farm audits. This evolution gives biological manufacturers a documentation advantage, because strain provenance and viable cell counts are already part of their QA workflow. Consequently, distributors report an uptick of just over one-third in inquiries specific to certification-compliant formulations since January 2024. Sugarcane estates are expected to follow this pattern. A concrete example lies in Jalisco, where Frutícola Zamora converted 2,900 hectares of raspberry tunnels to a certified regenerative protocol. The company replaced chlorpyrifos and carbendazim with Beauveria-based insecticides and seaweed biostimulants supplied through the Mexico biologicals market. Independent testing from Soil Food Web Lab recorded a 2.3-fold increase in active fungal biomass after one season, allowing the farm to meet ROC Mexico’s Tier-2 threshold ahead of schedule. Retail customers rewarded the shift by extending contracts from one to three years and adding a US$ 0.18 per-kilogram bonus. These financial signals reinforce the Mexico biologicals market as a core enabler of export competitiveness for specialty crops within global supply chains. Need a Customized Version? Request It Now: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/mexico-biologicals-market Strategic Outlook Highlights Opportunities In Data-Driven Product Stewardship And Traceability Looking ahead to 2026, three structural factors will likely dictate the competitive order. First, EU Deforestation-Free Regulation audits will expand traceability expectations to all upstream inputs, forcing suppliers to document microbial lineage with genome-level resolution. Second, climate volatility—2024 produced 38 days above 40 °C in northern Sonora—will intensify demand for heat-tolerant consortia capable of maintaining rhizosphere activity at 42 °C. Finally, carbon markets are moving toward outcome-based methodologies; projects verified by Mexico’s SEMARNAT accepted 312,000 tons of soil-organic-carbon credits in 2023, most of which relied on biological nitrogen-fixation models. These converging forces set the strategic stage for the Mexico biologicals market. Stakeholders therefore face compliance pressure and technology opportunity. To capitalize, stakeholders should invest in interoperable data standards that let farm-management software pull live application rates directly from smart sprayers and feed them into lifecycle-analysis tools. Manufacturers able to provide such machine-readable stewardship dossiers are expected to win procurement points with commodity traders and ESG-sensitive lenders. Equally important is after-sales agronomy: field coaches equipped with handheld qPCR units can confirm colony viability on-farm in under ninety minutes, turning stewardship into a recurring service-revenue line. By weaving analytics, verification, and support into a seamless bundle, the Mexico biologicals market can differentiate itself from generic input segments and sustain momentum through the coming regulatory and climatic future disruptions.

Title: Meme Stock Mania Is Back With Opendoor, Just As Chamath Palihapitiya’s Curse Strikes And The Housing Market Looks Poised To Crack

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Where to start with this one? Perhaps I should begin with the erstwhile "SPAC King" Chamath Palihapitiya, who led investors towards gargantuan losses once the SPAC bubble burst in late 2021. Or, maybe I should commence with leverage junkies who populate various stock fora, egging mom-and-pop investors to speculate in risky names. After all, Opendoor is a risky bet by any definition of the term. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Opendoor became a public company in the heydays of the SPAC bubble by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II, one of nearly a dozen SPACs launched by Chamath Palihapitiya, an ex-Meta executive and a venture capitalist. Opendoor sidesteps the usual bottlenecks within the residential real estate sector by purchasing homes directly from their owners, eliminating the need for brokers entirely. The company then undertakes quick refurbishments and resells purchased property, making money from the spread between the purchase price and the selling price of any given property. Opendoor attracts customers via the convenience that it offers: a seamless process and a quick path towards a cash offer. The company's business model is designed to optimize housing turnover, while minimizing expenses such as realtor brokerage fees. Interestingly, and wholly in line with the trend among de-SPAC'd companies, Opendoor has never generated any profit. For Q1 2025, the company reported $1.2 billion in revenue, and a net loss of 85 million. Its inventory of purchased homes also increased by 26 percent on an annual basis, rising to 7,080 homes by the end of Q1. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Opendoor shares have increased by 211 percent over the past five trading days. Of course, Monday's trading activity figures for the high-flying stock were one for the history books: 1.9 million Opendoor shares changed hands, capturing around 10 percent of the total trading activity on US stock exchanges for the day, as per a tabulation by Bloomberg's Yiqin Shen. What's more, Monday also saw around 2 million Opendoor call options change hands, constituting the third highest total for any given stock in 2025, and eclipsing the combined call volume for NVIDIA and Tesla for the day. According to Goldman Sachs, trading activity in penny stocks exceeds NVIDIA's when retail investors are active in the market. And, Monday saw around 19 penny stocks exceed NVIDIA's trading activity threshold. Of course, this elevated activity could not come at a more inopportune time. According to Goldman Sachs Chief Economist, Jan Hatzius, the housing market in the US is poised for an accelerated slowdown, with residential fixed investment likely to have dropped by 10 percent in Q2. Also, in what is likely to be a bad omen for Opendoor, around 87 percent of current mortgage holders have borrowed at a rate that is below current levels. This disparity is depressing housing turnover. Sales of existing homes in 2025 are likely to total just 4.1 million units, which represents an activity level that is 23 percent below 2019 levels. Of course, these brewing dark clouds are completely in line with the performance that can be reasonably expected from Chamath Palihapitiya-linked companies, whose other bets, including Virgin Galactic, have largely floundered.

Title: Multimodal AI startup Reka AI raises $110M at $1B valuation
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/22/multimodal-ai-startup-reka-ai-raises-110m-1b-valuation/
Time Published: 2025-07-22T15:00:32Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 11:00 EDT / JULY 22 2025 by Kyt Dotson Multimodal large language model research startup Reka AI Inc. today announced it has raised $110 million in fresh funding backed by Nvidia Corp. and Snowflake Inc. Founded in 2022, Reka develops multimodal models focusing on ultra-efficient training and serving infrastructure for delivering inference at low cost. The company offers multiple AI models including Reka Flash, a multimodal model capable of understanding video, images, text and audio, which is the flagship of the company’s family of models. Reka Vision and Reka Research are the company’s agentic AI platforms that have recently entered general availability providing complex question answering and visual search capabilities. According to a report from Bloomberg, the current funding round triples the company’s valuation to $1 billion, up from about $300 million after the company raised $50 million in a funding round that included the participation of Snowflake’s venture capital arm. Last year, Snowflake made overtures to acquire Reka, reportedly at a price more than three times higher than its valuation at the time. According to Bloomberg, the deal talks were scrapped after both companies decided to move on independently, but they still hold ties today. Vivek Raghunathan, vice president of AI engineering at Snowflake, told Bloomberg that Reka would provide AI models and other services to the company. “Very few teams in the world have the capability to build what they’ve built,” Raghunathan said. “Almost everyone at that level of talent is at OpenAI, Meta or Anthropic. Reka is one of the rare independents — and they’ve proven they can compete.” Reka recently released a competitively performing version of Reka Flash 3.1 that the company said shows high performance against similarly sized models such as Quen3-32B and OpenAI’s o3-mini. Reka Flash itself is a compact 21 billion-parameter model, which are the internal variables used by models to make decisions and also shape the overall size of a model impacting where it can fit. Using a method called quantization, a model’s memory footprint can be reduced, allowing it to run with less resources, such as mobile or edge devices. According to the company, Reka Quant allows for almost lossless quantization when processing Reka Flash 3.1, bringing down the size significantly with very little performance loss. According to the company Reka, Quant reduces resource usage with only a 1.6-point average degradation on hard reasoning benchmarks. The next best quantization routine incurs a 6.7-point average degradation. The company has grown from 20 to 50 employees over the past year. Although initially focused on building efficient models, Reka also develops tools to assist companies with AI interfaces and application logic. Reka said it intends to use the investment to significantly accelerate technical development on its models and scale its multimodal platforms, aiming for wider enterprise adoption and expansion of its global reach.

Editor’s note: This post is part of the AI On blog series, which explores the latest techniques and real-world applications of agentic AI, chatbots and copilots. The series also highlights the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries. With advancements in agentic AI, intelligent AI systems are maturing to now facilitate autonomous decision-making across industries, including financial services. Over the last year, customer service-related use of generative AI, including chatbots and AI assistants, has more than doubled in financial services, rising from 25% to 60%. Organizations are using AI to automate time-intensive tasks like document processing and report generation, driving significant cost savings and operational efficiency. According to NVIDIA’s latest State of AI in Financial Services report, more than 90% of respondents reported a positive impact on their organization’s revenue from AI. AI agents are versatile, capable of adapting to complex tasks that require strict protocols and secure data usage. They can help with an expanding list of use cases, from enabling better investment decisions by automatically identifying portfolio optimization strategies to ensuring regulatory alignment and compliance automation. To improve market returns and business performance, AI agents are being adopted in various areas that benefit greatly from autonomous decision-making backed by data. According to the State of AI in Financial Services report, 60% of respondents said customer experience and engagement was the top use case for generative AI. Businesses using AI have already seen customer experiences improve by 26%. AI agents can help automate repetitive tasks while providing next steps, such as dispute resolution and know-your-customer updates. This reduces operational costs and helps minimize human errors. By handling customer inquiries and forms, AI chatbots scale support and ensure 24/7 availability, enhancing customer satisfaction. Employees can focus on higher-level, judgment-based cases, rather than performing case intake, data analysis and documentation. In addition, AI agents are crucial for fraud detection, as they can detect and respond to suspicious transactions automatically. The State of AI report highlighted that out of 20 use cases, cybersecurity experienced the highest growth over the last year, with more than a third of respondents now assessing or investing in AI for cybersecurity. AI closes the time gap between detection and action, as a lack of action can result in significant financial loss. To combat fraud, AI agents can monitor transaction patterns in real time, learn from new types of fraud and take immediate action by alerting compliance teams or freezing suspicious accounts — all without the need for human intervention. Plus, teams of AI agents can work with other systems to retrieve additional data, simulate potential fraud scenarios and investigate abnormalities. AI agents make financial management easier, especially for bill payment and cash flow management. Because agentic AI supports machine-to-machine interactions in digital ecosystems, it can ensure regulatory compliance by automatically maintaining detailed audit trails. This reduces compliance costs and processing time, making it easier for financial institutions to operate in complex regulatory environments. For capital markets, the most powerful investment insights are often hidden in unstructured text data from everyday document sources such as news articles, blogs and SEC filings. AI agents can accelerate intelligent document processing (IDP) to provide insight and investment recommendations for traders, enabling faster decision-making and reducing the risk of financial losses. In consumer banking, handling documents like loan records, regulatory filings and transaction records involves a lot of complex data. This amount of data is so large that it can be difficult and time-consuming to process and understand it manually. IDP helps solve this issue, using AI to identify document types, summarize documents, employ retrieval-augmented generation for answers and support, and organize data. The data-driven insights from multi-agent systems inform strategic business decisions as these systems continuously learn from customer and institutional data using a data flywheel. Many industry customers and partners have benefited significantly from integrating AI into their workflows. For example, BlackRock uses Aladdin, a proprietary platform that unifies investment management processes across public and private markets for institutional investors. With numerous Aladdin applications and thousands of specialized users, the BlackRock team identified an opportunity to use AI to streamline the platform’s user experience while fostering connectivity and operational efficiency. Rapidly and securely, BlackRock has bolstered the Aladdin platform with advanced AI through Aladdin Copilot. Using a federated development model, where different teams can work on AI agents independently while building on a common foundation, BlackRock’s central AI team established a standardized communication system and plug-in registry. This allows the firm’s developers and data scientists to create and deploy AI agents tailored to their specific areas, improving intelligence and efficiency for clients. Another example is bunq’s generative AI platform, Finn, which offers users a range of features to help manage finances through an in-app chatbot. It can answer questions about money, provide insight into spending habits and offer tips on using the bunq app. Finn uses advanced AI to improve its responses based on feedback and, beyond the in-app chatbot, now handles over 90% of all users’ support tickets. Capital One is also assisting customers with Chat Concierge, its multi-agent conversational AI assistant designed to enhance the automotive-buying experience. Consumers have 24/7 access to agents that provide real-time information and take action based on user requests. In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can perform tasks like comparing vehicles to help car buyers find their ideal choice and scheduling test drives or appointments with a sales team. RBC’s latest platform for global research, Aiden, uses internal agents to automatically perform analysis when companies covered by RBC Capital Markets release SEC filings. Aiden has an orchestration agent working with other agents, such as the SEC filing agent, earnings agent and a real-time news agent.

Title: What Amazon Prime Day Predicts About Upcoming Holiday Shopping Trends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/07/22/what-amazon-prime-day-predicts-about-upcoming-holiday-shopping-trends/

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Amazon Prime Day saw mixed results: initial sales reports were disputed, final growth was estimated to be modest (4.9%), and web traffic declined. However, consumers showed strong purchase intent, actively seeking deals across retailers due to inflation. Analysts project 2.5-3% Q4 retail growth, highlighting consumer resilience despite economic uncertainties and potential supply chain challenges. Happy family and their daughter shopping online for Christmas Controversy erupted early on July 8, the first of Amazon Prime Day’s four-day sales extravaganza. Momentum Commerce, which manages $7 billion in sales annually on Amazon, reported first day sales were down 41% compared to last year. An Amazon spokesperson fired back, telling Forbes that the report was “highly inaccurate” and that Momentum Commerce, a third-party consultancy firm, didn’t have access to the full dataset. However, the damage was done, thanks to the anchoring bias where the news broke, it was already stained in people’s memory. Amazon’s post-Prime Day wrap-up didn’t help, since it provided no sales figures or any hint at growth. It claimed record-breaking sales, but it didn’t factor in the fact that the event went from two to four days. With two more days, Amazon was bound to break records. Questions remained even after Adobe Analytics reported that aggregated four-day e-commerce sales exceeded projections, totaling $24.1 billion in online retail sales on a 30.3% year-over-year increase. Increasingly, analysts look to Prime Day results to help forecast holiday retail performance. The apples-to-oranges comparison complicates an already complicated picture. Digging into a variety of sources provides a clearer picture of how Amazon performed over Prime Day and where the retail market is headed into the holiday season. Let’s start here: Consumers didn’t wait until July Prime Day to pick up their shopping pace. For June, retailers posted a 0.6% seasonally adjusted uptick in spending from May and a 3.7% unadjusted increase year-over-year. While Momentum’s first day report was discredited, it released a final estimate that Amazon Prime Day sales over the four days generated 4.9% total sales growth compared to the combined performance of 2024's two-day Prime Day and the two days immediately following. That fell well under Momentum’s prediction of 9.1% growth for Amazon over the four-day event. Momentum also expected that demand would be softer during the first two days and would build on days three and four. Similarweb, which tracks online traffic, found in an apples-to-apples comparison that Amazon web traffic was down. Average daily visits to Amazon.com dropped 15% comparing last year’s two-day event (July 16 and 17) to this year’s four-days (July 8 to 11). FOMO (fear of missing out) played in Amazon’s favor in 2024. And app usage followed a similar downward trajectory. Last year’s two-day event averaged 113.9 million visitors per day compared to an average of 104.1 million per day over the four-days, a 9% drop. Nonetheless, Amazon still attracted over 400 million visitors to this year’s Prime Day. However, when shoppers showed up to Amazon Prime Day, they came loaded for bear, according to a post-Prime Day survey conducted among 400 consumers by Coresight Research. Some 48% of consumers reported making a purchase, compared with 38% last year and bettering the 34% who planned to make a purchase, based on a May pre-event survey. There also was a significant increase in the share of 2025 Amazon Prime Day shoppers who reported spending more (43%) compared to 31% last year. Coresight’s consumer research also revealed shoppers widely engaged with competing sales events hosted by Walmart and Target. Over one-third of consumers reported they compared offerings across multiple retailers. They also mixed planned with spontaneous impulse buys and were motivated by early access offers and staggered promotional deals. Commenting on the survey results, Coresight’s John Mercer, who manages the firm’s global research, noted that there was a significant amount of opportunistic shopping behavior this year tied to Prime Day, as consumers sought to maximize value across competing sales events. “When consumers are cautious about inflation or the macro-environment, as we’ve seen in previous holiday seasons, they tend to pull forward some spending to spread out costs,” he said. “We think that is the case this year with consumers having concerns about inflation-driven price rises late in the season.” We’ll have to wait until Amazon reports on July 31 to get a better accounting. It’s up against a comparative 9% increase to $90 billion in North America net sales in the second quarter last year, excluding AWS. In the first quarter, North America sales advanced 8% to $92.9 billion. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Mercer and the Coresight team see positive momentum, despite widespread consumer concern about tariffs increasing prices as the year advances. Coresight provided three possible scenarios for fourth-quarter retail performance. The most likely is retail growth in the 2.5% to 3% range, what it calls the central scenario. Interestingly, Coresight’s machine-learning model forecasts a 3.5% year-over-year increase, the upside scenario. However, the analyst team considers the more moderate growth forecast to be more “reasonable,” with a 45% overall probability versus a 30% probability for the upside scenario. Coresight also figures there is a 25% probability that retail sales will decline by 2.5% or more in the fourth quarter, should the economy take a turn for the worse with increased layoffs and rising prices causing consumer sentiment to deteriorate. “This would accelerate deal-seeking consumer behaviors and could ultimately contribute to stagflation (slow economic growth and persistently high inflation) or a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth),” Coresight warned. Another confounding factor that might mitigate retail growth in the fourth quarter is what Mercer described as the “lumpy” supply chain. Retailers picked up imports before April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, followed by a slump and another surge after the worse of the tariffs were postponed to August 1. “It makes it hard to match demand with supply,” he said. “So if we get to the holiday season and there is relatively solid consumer demand, the supply may not be there to match it. We could see a replay of holiday 2021, when consumers saw bare shelves and struggled to get some products. “Markdowns were far fewer then and more was sold at full price. So counterintuitively, we could end up seeing less discounting this holiday if the lumpy supply chain doesn’t match up to consumer demand,” he said. Despite the doomsday headlines surrounding tariff uncertainty, retail sales have climbed 3.6% through the first half of 2025 to total $4.2 trillion. While inflation inched up in June to 2.7% from 2.4% in May, it’s still below the first-half 2024 average of 3.3%. By contrast, inflation has averaged 2.6% from January to June 2025. Notably, January to June 2024 retail sales rose 2.6% over 2023 – lagging behind inflation. That’s not the case in 2025, where retail growth has outpaced rising prices, underscoring consumer momentum and resilience. “Consumers continue to spend in the face of uncertainty and shrugging off tariff concerns, with U.S. retail sales showing relative stability compared to last month and outpacing inflation compared to a year ago,” said Katie Thomas, Kearney Consumer Institute. While many observers expect retail sales to slow as the year progresses after the full force of tariffs hit, American consumer resilience could defy expectations and keep retail going strong, making Coresight’s upside 3.5% fourth-quarter growth scenario a distinct possibility.

On Tuesday, major artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturers, including Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Broadcom AVGO, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, Arm Holdings ARM, Marvell Technology MRVL, and Qualcomm QCOM, traded lower. This decline comes after the reports of significant disagreements between OpenAI and SoftBank SFTBY regarding the operational control and execution of the ambitious $500 billion Stargate AI project, leading to a substantial scale-back of its original scope. Internal feuds between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son have stalled the project, dramatically scaling back its grand vision, and drawing a sharp “I told you so” from Elon Musk, who has consistently questioned the venture’s financial backing. Also Read: OpenAI’s 4.5 GW Lease From Oracle Fuels Stargate’s $500 Billion Vision The Stargate AI project, initially envisioned as a massive $500 billion initiative for building AI infrastructure, has faced severe delays due to fundamental clashes between Altman and Son. Although they initially agreed to share leadership, with Altman overseeing operations and Son managing financing, their partnership has been fraught with disputes over control, governance, and strategic direction. This feud has stalled significant progress, leaving Stargate without any secured data center deals and scaling ambitions back to a single, smaller facility in Ohio by year’s end. The internal deadlock has sapped the project’s momentum just months after its high-profile White House debut. Amid a persistent shortage of Nvidia chips driven by surging AI demand, a June report indicated a growing opportunity for AMD. Companies like Oracle ORCL and OpenAI are increasingly considering AMD’s next-generation Instinct GPUs, specifically engineered for large-scale AI workloads, as viable alternatives for major projects such as Stargate, given Nvidia’s challenges in meeting supply. Arm Holdings solidified its crucial role in the AI landscape by joining OpenAI’s Stargate infrastructure project in February. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Rene Haas highlighted Arm’s increasing presence in data center deployments, driven by key collaborations with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. Arm’s chip architecture is poised to form the core of large-scale AI infrastructure for the Stargate project, beginning with an 875-acre AI campus in Abilene, Texas. This initiative will commence with a 200-megawatt data center, with plans to expand up to 1.2 gigawatts, underscoring Arm’s architecture as a foundational element for future AI growth. Adding to the skepticism, Elon Musk has reiterated his doubts about the Stargate project’s financial viability. Reacting to the news of the stalled OpenAI and SoftBank AI infrastructure venture, Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, referencing his earlier assertion that the project lacks actual funding. “They simply don’t,” he wrote, responding to a user who resurfaced his earlier remark – “They don’t actually have the money.” Musk, whose own AI startup xAI is constructing a massive data center in Memphis, has consistently questioned the feasibility of Stargate.

Yves here. American abuse of its supposed strategic allies has gotten to be so severe and inexcusable that some are having debates in political circles and the media about why they are continuing to accept this treatment. It’s as if the abusive husband intensified his wife-beating even as his income was shrinking due to bad career moves. Admittedly, the US has been engaged in a stunning show of disrespect and preening sense of entitlement towards Europe, so there’s every reason to see if the US can pull the same stunt on the Pacific Rim. The US harmed all of Europe by promising it would do whatever it takes to beat Russia in Ukraine in a conflict the US sought, drained NATO members of weapons stocks and EU states via non-military Ukraine assistance, and harmed Europe and most of all Germany by blowing up the Nordstream pipeline. But to add insult to injury, the Trump team has threatened the EU with further harm via sanctions while acting as if Europe should further subsidize the US by buying US weapons to continue Project Ukraine, rather than let them derive some modest benefit from continued war-mongering by fabricating their own arms. Now this pattern is obviously self-destructive, but there’s at least an explanation, which is the Iron Law of Institutions. The US exerts considerable influence in EU institutions and the NGOs that are career ladders and safety nets for pols and bureaucrats. So they see upside in playing nicely with the US and risk if they don’t. My sense is that while there is, or was, fear of crossing the US among its soi-disant Asian and antipodean allies, the upside is more limited. The Andrew Korybko piece below focuses on a fresh bit of US cheek, in the barely-coded demand by Under Secretary of Defense Eldridge Colby to Japanese and Australian official to pre-commit to assisting the US if things get ugly in its planned escalation with China. Although space prevents us from giving the full context, Japan and Australia were already souring on the US before the latest demand, Renegotiating such complicated relationships won’t happen quickly, but the fact that both countries are debating whether the US is worth its ever rising price is a seismic shift. For Japan, Trump’s trade thuggery has been a slap in the face, and the US shows no interest in repairing the damage. Alienating Japan is even more epically stupid than alienating Canada, since Japan is richer and in a more geopolitically important location. Unlike the EU, Japan has also been uncomfortable with its status as a military protectorate1 but has lacked an internal consensus as to what if anything to do about it. When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, Japan made a point of being one of the first to enter into talks. As former ambassador Chas Freeman recounted it, the Japanese were shocked to find the US completely unprepared, with no proposals as to what it might provide Japan and what it might expect in return, and instead thuggishly asked Japan what it was prepared to offer to escape US tariff punishment. If you have ever worked with the Japanese, they are extremely loath to complain or argue. The fact that many officials are now sharply criticizing US conduct means they are incandescent. The depth of the souring on the US is confirmed by media reports that Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea were discussing how to coordinate trade talk strategies against the US. I am pretty sure the translation below was sanitized. The key word reported elsewhere was “gangster”. Note that this was the head of the opposition party and the ruling LPD just suffered its biggest setback in 70 years in upper house elections, with the government’s poor performance in the trade negotiations cited as a big, if not the, reason: This Japanese MP (whose name is Shinji Oguma) absolutely nails it, and reflects what pretty all countries in Asia are thinking: pic.twitter.com/U1jZahc5Sh “When Japan negotiates with what [Trump] is saying it’s akin to being extorted by a delinquent.

The disgraceful AUKUS submarine deal was a massive sellout to the US. For an overview, a section from a 2023 cross post by Prabir Purkayastha: The recent Australia, U.S., and UK $368 billion deal on buying nuclear submarines has been termed by Paul Keating, a former Australian prime minister, as the “worst deal in all history.” It commits Australia to buy conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines that will be delivered in the early 2040s. These will be based on new nuclear reactor designs yet to be developed by the UK. Meanwhile, starting from the 2030s, “pending approval from the U.S. Congress, the United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed” (Trilateral Australia-UK-U.S. Partnership on Nuclear-Powered Submarines, March 13, 2023; emphasis mine). According to the details, it appears that this agreement commits Australia to buy from the U.S. eight new nuclear submarines, to be delivered from the 2040s through the end of the 2050s. If nuclear submarines were so crucial for Australia’s security, for which it broke its existing diesel-powered submarine deal with France, this agreement provides no credible answers. For those who have been following the nuclear proliferation issues, the deal raises a different red flag. If submarine nuclear reactor technology and weapons-grade (highly enriched) uranium are shared with Australia, it is a breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to which Australia is a signatory as a non-nuclear power. Even the supplying of such nuclear reactors by the U.S. and the UK would constitute a breach of the NPT. This is even if such submarines do not carry nuclear but conventional weapons as stated in this agreement. So why did Australia renege on its contract with France, which was to buy 12 diesel submarines from France at a cost of $67 billion, a small fraction of its gargantuan $368 billion deal with the U.S.? What does it gain, and what does the U.S. gain by annoying France, one of its close NATO allies? And as Satyajit Das noted: American willingness or ability to support allies, other than with financial assistance and low risk stand-off weaponry, is questionable. Outside of minor affairs like Panama and Granada, the US record in military combat is unimpressive. For Australians tied to the US and UK through the opaque 2021 AUKUS defence agreement, the possibility of being drawn into a military conflict with China and the prospect of the American cavalry not reporting for duty is a clear concern. The parallel to Great Britain’s abandonment of Australia during the World War 2 is striking. The criticism has become even more fierce as new bad facts are coming out, including a campaign to exit AUKUS: Australia “could sacrifice sovereignty” in AUKUS alignment, says Former FM #opinions pic.twitter.com/QVf3kdPVHb — T-House (@thouse_opinions) July 15, 2025 You thought the toxic nuclear submarines were the worst part of AUKUS. It gets worse… much worse. pic.twitter.com/DEsX0fQn8y — David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) July 10, 2025 Nuclear waste costs are expected to double the already nosebleed level price tag. As the Michael West site explains (which ample detail): Everything about AUKUS nuclear waste is a political secret, including the cost, which will more than double the $368B announced AUKUS price tag. Former submariner Rex Patrick with the story. If we ever get these subs, the total price tag may well be over $1 trillion. I’m in the Federal Court at present, trying to pry open a November 2023 report into how the Government intends to deal with the high-level nuclear waste from AUKUS submarines. But there’s already a lot we can deduce by combining what has been extracted from the Government using Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, from Senate testimony and also looking at how the United States does and doesn’t take care of its naval nuclear waste. For starters, there was a short but insightful exchange in Senate Estimates last year between Senator Lidia Thorpe and the head of the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA), Admiral Jonathon Mead. After making quick reference to the cost of nuclear waste facilities overseas, Senator Thorpe asked about the waste costs for AUKUS, “There’s no costing as yet; is that right?” Mead responded, “That’s correct”. For an organisation that is required to cost its capability from cradle to grave, including support facilities, it’s a huge omission. It might be the case that they’re too frightened to do the math We’ll see if the backbenchers have enough support to move the leadership: Rank-and-file Labor members in Victoria are preparing to launch a blistering attack on US president Donald Trump and demand the Albanese government withdraw from AUKUS.https://t.co/gBfNxeG8Xe — Financial Review (@FinancialReview) July 22, 2025 Now to the main event. By Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst who specializes in the global systemic transition to multipolarity in the New Cold War. He has a PhD from MGIMO, which is under the umbrella of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Originally published at his website Playing any role in a Sino-US war over Taiwan, even a logistical one, could provoke Chinese retaliation. The Financial Times reported that US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby recently asked Australian and Japanese defense officials how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. He also asked them to boost defense spending after NATO just agreed to do so during its latest summit. Colby lent credence to this report by tweeting that he’s “focused on implementing the President’s America First, common sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength.” This sequence shows that Trump 2.0 is serious about “Pivoting (back) to (East) Asia” in order to more robustly contain China. This requires freezing the Ukrainian Conflict and assembling a de facto Asian NATO, however, both of which are uncertain. As regards the first, Trump is being drawn into “mission creep”, while the latter is challenged by Australia’s and Japan’s reluctance to step up. To elaborate, they seemingly expected the US to do all the “heavy lifting”, just like NATO expected till recently as well. That would explain why they didn’t have a clear answer to Colby’s inquiry about how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. Simply put, they likely never planned to do anything at all, thus exposing the shallowness of the de facto Asian NATO that the US has sought to assemble in recent years via the AUKUS+ format. This refers to the AUKUS trilateral of Australia, the UK, and the US alongside what can be described as the honorary members of Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australia and Japan are correspondingly envisaged as this informal bloc’s Southeast and Northeast Asian anchors, yet they’re evidently unwilling to fulfill the military roles that their US senior partner expects. What it apparently had in mind was them at the very least playing supportive logistical roles in the scenario of a Sino-US war but their representatives reportedly didn’t even suggest as much to Colby. This in turn reveals that they fear retaliation from China even if they don’t participate in combat. Japan’s population and resultant economic density make it extremely vulnerable to Chinese missile strikes while unconventional warfare could be waged against Australia through sabotage and the like. Moreover, China is their top trade partner, which opens up additional avenues for retaliation. At the same time, however, neither of them wants China to seize control of Taiwan’s TSMC (if it even survives a speculative conflict) and obtain a monopoly over the global semiconductor industry. The US doesn’t want that either, but the problem is that the two envisaged anchors of its de facto Asian NATO aren’t willing to boost defense spending nor seemingly assist America in a war over Taiwan. That’s unacceptable from Trump 2.0’s perspective so tariff and other forms of pressure could be applied for coercing Australia and Japan into at least spending more on their armed forces. The endgame, however, is for them to agree to play some sort of role (whether logistical or ideally combative) in that scenario. Seeing as how the US won’t relent on its “Pivot (back) to (East) Asia”, it’ll likely coerce the aforesaid concessions from Australia and Japan one way or another. The same goes for the other members of AUKUS+, namely South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan, albeit with perhaps a little less defense spending from the last two. All in all, “The US Is Rounding Up Allies Ahead Of A Possible War With China” as was assessed in May 2023, but it’s anyone’s guess whether it actually plans to spark a major conflict. ____ 1 Depending on who is doing the grading, Japan’s self defense force ranks between number five and number 8 in military power. An important white paper argued for increasing defense spending from 1% of GDP to 2% by 2027. That damned stupid nuke sub deal. Of course that happened when Scotty from Marketing was Prime Minister and I think that he got a kick from doing the dirty on the French. Last I heard, he got a job with an American think tank. For both Japan and Oz – as well as all those other Asian countries – is that the demands never stop. The US wants logistical support which is fair enough. But then it wants those nations to confront China. Then it wants all those countries to hand over 5% of their GDP to the MIC which would mean buying US weaponry, even if it means all those countries will have their economies wrecked. Now the US is demanding that if the US goes to war against China, that it wants Japan and Oz to sign up as well. And that would mean that we would be dependent on an erratic, mercurial and unpredictable Trump regime to decide for us if we go to war or not. Maybe that is why our present PM went on that trade mission to China. Trying to get some sort of balance and smooth relations. So what other demands will Washington be making the next three and a half years? I hate to think. Putting my tin foil hat on, I would make an observation about those nuclear wastes. I think that in the end that they will store those nuclear wastes here in Oz. More than that, the US will lean on Oz to store their nuclear wastes too for a nominal rent as it is contentious subject in the US. I once read this American official suggest that as the uranium came from Oz originally, then Oz had a responsibility to take it back in its end form for long term storage. That argument goes nowhere. That is like saying that if the US imports coal from Canada to burn in the US, then Canada has a responsibility to take back that coal ash and any pollution as well. But you can bet that there are some in DC eyeing Oz as a destination for all that nuclear waste accumulating in the US. I think the US and UK subs will ‘just happen to be in Australia’ when it’s time to dump their waste. There’s tons of waste stuck in Portsmouth the UK doesn’t know what to do with for their useless subs. I always thought it was all about the nuclear waste disposal. The rest was face-saving window dressing for the Australian public. The date for delivery of these subs is so far away, that if it happens, I will be very surprised. Morrison allowed the US to white ant our security organisations while our minds were on COVID, this was on purpose. This was at the time he and Hurley tried to finagle the Federal Executive Council on the quiet. US defence installations here are visible to all but their security takeover is not. The US is on the wrong side of history and our deep state intends for us to go down this road with them, the only real impediment is the Gaza genocide, Marles and others are supporting the Israelis on the quiet but there is a huge resistance to this here which could derail their plans. Make no mistake, the US is sizing up Australia and Japan to be the next US proxies in a war against China – just as Ukraine has been used and abused as a proxy in a US war against Russia. Australians need to learn a lesson from Germany and the destruction of the Nordstream Pipeline. THIS is how America treats a loyal ally. And don’t think this situation is especially bad because it is Trump. Nordstream was planned and executed by the Biden Administration, as was the war in Ukraine. Take it from an American, neither party is trustworthy. If we don’t have a nuclear war, China will continue to rise and the US and Europe will continue to decline. Australia needs to hitch its horse to the winning team and its best trading partner. And for the record, China has no interest in invading Australia unless the US starts shooting nuclear weapons from its shores. The neocons and other Washington elite seem to taken the American allies (really vassal states) for granted. It was inevitable that there would be some type of backlash, owing to the abuse that they were taking. The AUKUS deal occurred during Biden and burned both the French, but later as they learned the hard way, also the Australians themselves. Not discussed in the article in as much depth is how AUKUS is worsening tensions with China. I think that many other nations are going to realize that they are not junior partners for the US, but just another colony for the US elites to exploit. Trump’s tariffs may have been the last straw for some, on top of the neocons before him that made various demands of the US vassals, such as joining the US in Iraq. The same is true about the war in Ukraine, which the US provoked to try to break up Russia. The Europeans thought that they would be a junior partner and get some part of looting Russia, once it got regime changed. Of course Russia is winning in Ukraine, while Europe suffers from loss of industry, international reputation, and living standards. The war in Ukraine was never in Europe’s interests, but their corrupt leaders went along with it. They should have done a rapprochement with Russia at the end of the Cold War. On the morality front, the US wars in Iraq, when the US lied about Saddam having WMDs, and now genocide in Palestine, by backing its proxy Israel, have damaged America’s image irreparably. I suspect that the truth about Ukraine will as well someday. It’s a loss of soft power. As the US continues to decline, and the upside of complying with US demands becomes smaller, we are going to see more of this. The US doesn’t have the industrial base, nor the military strength, and increasingly does not have the world’s best technologies to offer other nations. As the US middle class declines, the US consumer market is not as lucrative an export market anymore. The world no longer aspires to be like the US. That’s a function of the evil actions that the American elite have done around the world and the falling living standards within the US itself. Hopefully in the future, the corrupt politicians who betrayed their nations by bending the knee to Washington will be held to account in their nations and face trials, along with other legal consequences. What’s astounding is how self-inflicted America’s problems are. The US elite of this generation will go down as some of the least competent leaders in history. They were as incompetent as they were evil. That will be their final historical judgement. Can guarantee the UK won’t bandon the US. The entire political class (including Reform) are completely beholding to them. I think a part of the british elite actually lives vicariously through the american elite and their empire. You have read my mind. I got that idea from reading Churchill. Some of his post war writings give the strong impression he felt Britain was “passing” on responsibility for the world to America. And as the USA was really a descendent of Britain in his view then that meant Britain wasn’t really losing it’s place. Self induldgent nonsense really, but I think that is a view that the british elite have, at least subconsciously. Part of it might have come from the fact that he had an American mother. The right wing LNP coalition, often thought of as simply the political wing of Newscorp in Australia, immediately demanded that the centrist ruling ALP commit to fighting in Taiwan. This without the USA itself committing to it. Australians have suffered 40 years of propaganda and social engineering to make it US militarism-friendly. Australians are isolated from their political system and riven by mindless culture wars. We are prime fodder for a proxy war. The ALP has a history of internal coups to create US-friendly administrations, the first in the mid 70s and the last in 2010 where the wikileaks showed that the prime minister was ousted for not being US friendly enough in refusing to join the quad or to have a US garrison in our northernmost port. His replacement, duly signed off on by the US embassy, immediately joined the quad and let the marines in. Australians are so divorced from reality that when told that the marines were simply a ‘rotational force’ they accepted it, obviously thinking other US bases have the troops sent there for life. The AUKUS deal has just as much to do with giving our military bases to the USA as it has to do with subs. Since 1996 massive emphasis has been placed in the Australian Defence Force on ‘interoperability’ to the point it is now a provincial arm of the US military with funny accents. Doctrine, equipment and logistics is steadily being replaced with US versions. Ask an member of the military. Australians will line up for their war, they believe the newspapers. They’ll especially line up for it if the happens to be a serendipitous and precipitous downturn in the economy as has happened in Europe to create a pool of ready (hungry) recruits. Australia is the stationary aircraft carrier in the S-W Pacific wholly owned by the USA. The only real essential to its US masters being Pine Gap. The other US bases and infrastructure are just performative and for a show of strength to Asia, as any next war is, as we are seeing in the Middle East, about rocketry delivering “kinetic” payloads. A consideration that rarely gets mentioned is the obscurely named Force Posture Agreement (FPA) https://johnmenadue.com/post/2023/05/what-is-the-us-australia-force-posture-agreement-fpa/. Vassalisation complete. 94% of Australians polled as opposed to the war in Iraq, a number that simply does not exist in poling. 250,000 protested in Sydney, as in over 5% of its population then of 4 million. But to your point, when Australia (liberal John Howard) joined the coalition of the willing, Australia fell in line. The continued grumbling was minimal, although ABC and SBS did cover in great detail how horrific conditions were for Iraqis, like the looting of hospitals and severe limits on electricity (only a few hours a day). These days watching SBS is like watching a cross between Fox News and CNN. I use to watch them for the news. These days I watch it to see what the agreed upon narrative is. Australia has dutifully followed the US into every war it could since WWII. And never gets tired of reminding them. Woe betide the 1st PM not to commit to the next one. Former PM Morrison’s AUKUS brain fart was, for him first and foremost an election ploy. It was intended that he would sign the docs in person alongside a US President then call an election. Unfortunately Covid meant he got a Zoom meeting instead. Still he got a job out of it. Lobbying with fellow evangelical and neocon & former director of the CIA Mike Pompeo. Oh, so *that’s* why they pushed out Rudd, the best Prime Minister you’ve had in ages. Thanks for explaining. (Rudd speaks fluent Mandarin.) This is more Making Shit Up. I was in Australia for a few years before Rudd became PM. I had been a fan and was shocked at how quickly he imploded. He had been a brilliant opposition leader and quickly started flailing about as PM. He was a more charismatic and articulate Jimmy Carter, a bad administrator by virtue of being a micromanager. He had less excuse than Carter by virtue of not being an outsider. He was self-destructing all on his own. The real question is whether, when the shooting starts, these US “allies (with plenty of well-earned hate-America reasons)” show up. My guess is not. Andrew K. doesn’t opine. China has never been an existential threat to Japan (well at least until that pesky genocide from 1937-45, lol) The invasion of Japan by “China” was when China was ruled/occupied by a Mongol elite. Of course PRC wants to expand its sphere of economic influence, but China is never going to “Red Dawn” Japan…even if Japan is involved in a Taiwan conflict. The US creates the instability it ostensibly seeks to prevent by placing its mlilitary within a lazy 60 min. flight’s radius of China in Korea and Japan True, but this doesn’t stop the Japanese media from constantly spreading fear about China and especially the DPRK. I would say that the sources of instability are: (1) The CCP’s obsession with territorial expansion — with Taiwan, which historically was never Chinese — let it go, guys — with Tibet — with Xinkiang — with Hong Kong — with the South China Sea. You have enough land, dudes, stop being so obsessive about having more. This behavior appears threatening to everyone, including Vietnam, the Phillipines, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Laos, literally everyone. (2) The Kim dynasty’s desire to stay in power in North Korea despite having grotesquely mismanaged the economy to the point where they need repeated bailouts (alternating bailouts from China and Russia), and refusal to normalize relations with anyone or take a South Korean bailout. This is why the US is still stationed in South Korea. This is serious Making Shit Up, which is a violation of our written site Policies. Did you miss that Hong Kong was always part of China and only leased to the UK? China DID lose a lot of cred in the international community with their heavy handed takeover. But their right to Hong Kong is not at issue. As for Taiwan, Xi had expressed only a vague aspiration that Taiwan rejoin China by 2049. The increase in Chinese incomes relative to Taiwan would have led more Taiwanese over time to seek jobs in China (there is already some employment of Taiwanese in China) and could have achieved normalization all on its own. It’s the US that escalated, threatened by China’s ever increasing military and economic power and realizing if it were to act, 2027 was probably the latest time the US had. I am now in Southeast Asia and have a much better view than before of how aggressive Chinese businessmen very much cut the pie in their favor. The Chinese are hard core mercantilists. But that does not make everything they do unwarranted. I admit I know too little about this, but I’m wondering if, in case the Australians wanted to push back they could use Pine Gap or the Harold E. Holt joint naval communication station as leverage… somehow. Last time we tried it Mi6/CIA with the help of our own secret services ASIO overthrew the prime minister in an internal coup. Ugh, that’s terrible. :-( Thanks, James! Will look into this more. I did find this website that discusses both sites in some detail: https://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/defence-facilities/pine-gap/pine-gap-intro/ Great stuff this. It is getting more and more interesting…finally at least a bit of disagreement with the US from the East Asian vassals. Shinji Oguma summed it up. Will it all blow over, or get worse? Looks like the latter. Just an indulgent thought: what if ROK or Japan politely told the US to piss off and announced the cessation of all future SOFA (Status of Forces) agreements with the US and the eventual evacuation of all US military? What amount of financial and economic pressure could prevent such an event? That would be a historical event…it might take a while but the writing is on the wall. The US would undertake covert action against Japan and/or the ROK, to keep them in line, as it has done in the past. Why do they need covert action if the CIA owns the Liberal Democrats? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? Good question. There was an attempt, right before the election last weekend, to plant the idea of a link between Russia and Sanseito(aka the Japan First party). Wonder where that came from? Deteriorating economic conditions typically produce a rise in right wing support. As you note, the LDP is losing power in the Diet. The Japanese public has become sick of the endless scandals, corruption, dark money, and LDP connections to the whackjob Unification Church. It is entirely possible that Jiminto will become a minority party in the foreseeable future. Some of the other right-wing parties are LDP-adjacent pseudo-opposition, but may not be fully under control of the USian security apparatus. Following an electoral upset, a situation could thus arise in which the mechanisms of control that you suspect are no longer functional. (Btw, I assume this mechanism is also hypothetical, so we can entertain it as a possibility rather than a fact, but do you by chance have any hard evidence of how this mechanism of influence actually works in the present? I mean documents or credible investigative journalism or other hard evidence, i.e., not handwaving?) As Yves points out, above, economic conditions in Japan are deteriorating. Commodity prices are increasing. The price of rice has been at the center of a scandal. Ultra-right-wing parties like Sanseito are speaking to people who feel precarious, worry about food security, and want to blame foreigners. They target low information voters, of which there are many in Japan because media literacy is poor and civil society is weak to non-existent. Otherwise, it’s the usual script, nothing terribly new. This question from JohnnyJames is a hypothetical — i.e., what would happen if the Japanese leadership chose to exit ANPO, and either go it alone or else (another possibility) make peace with China, either of which presupposes that the leadership makes a decision to no longer submit to the American Empire (the “Japan that can say ‘no'”) —, and I submit that the most plausible answer is drawn from history, both in Japan and elsewhere. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the US today really looks like “the gang that can’t shoot straight” so it would make perfect sense for bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki to be quietly drawing up plans for a post-ANPO Japan, whatever that looks like. The other possibility (noted by Michael Hudson, I believe) would be that Japan becomes the Ukraine of East Asia, fighting a proxy war against China on behalf of the Empire. I assume the Japanese bureaucrats are not stupid enough to go down that path, especially given that the future of Ukraine as a nation is today rather in question, but again, a terror campaign against the Japanese public could change more than a few opinions. If China wants Taiwan badly enough, China will get Taiwan. You just have to look at a map. A long delaying action (including nominal acknowledgement of the ‘one China’ policy) is the only sensible Western policy on the matter, and to date China has seemed perfectly willing to preserve the status quo and use it as a bargaining chip. Doing nothing in response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, as opposed to starting a massive war in the Pacific between global powers that could only end in defeat, would be a rational response. Does anybody really think the US would expend resources to protect Australia if it came under threat in the event of a defeat? Or that it could do so successfully enough to change the outcome, even if it would? Look at Ukraine. Based on past behavior the US would abandon any ally to its fate were it deemed expedient to do so. Given the purely transactional nature of any dealing with Trump and his administration, Japan and Australia … and all the others … should look to their interests. With all those US bases Japan is a big fat target should things get messy. WHat exactly does Australia gain from cozying up to the US? Stalin has been dead 72 years. The Soviet Union expired more than 30 years ago. DPRK has the A Bomb and functioning delivery systems. Their main target is US military sites in East Asian. Local nations should opt for disarmament, including any hint of U.S. nuclear umbrella. US treaty organization in East Asia would soon set very costly standards of self defense. Japan, for example, depends in part on U.S. for leaky missile defense which US in a treaty organization, would demand Japan provide. Japan, ROK and Oz should give non aligned peace a chance. A good round up on this is whether we could say ‘no’ at all with such a large US security presence in-country. https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/with-so-much-local-us-military-presence-can-australia-really-say-no-to-a-war-on-china/ These countries can be better allies by telling America to shut down these crazy unwinnable wars or threats of war/trade wars. But I suspect they cannot, and after a while the only reasonable action for them to take is to reach out to China and form a relationship there more closely aligned to their national interests.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has risen by 23% since early January and remains up almost 80% from lows seen in April as AI driven demand remains strong. However, there are concerns. One word. Okay, two maybe. Customer concentration. In Q1 FY’26, (ended April 2025) Nvidia disclosed that one customer accounted for 16% of revenue and another for 14%, both tied to its Compute & Networking segment. That’s up from 11% and 13% sales from two direct customers in the same quarter a year ago. We’re worried about that. Imagine paying close to $35 billion a year to Nvidia. How long is that going to happen? Separately, is PepsiCo stock still attractive? See What’s Happening With PepsiCo Stock?

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Although Nvidia doesn’t name them, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta are widely understood to be among its largest customers. These customers are in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure. A substantial portion of this will flow directly to Nvidia for GPU purchases. AI data centers also require costly land, building, electricity infrastructure, cooling, and networking systems. However, we aren't so sure these companies will keep investing the way they have on AI in the longer run. Why is that? Sketchy Returns on AI Investments The economics of the end market for AI, particularly for GPU-driven applications, remains uncertain. Most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments yet. Let’s take Google, for instance. Its core search business, which generated over $170 billion in 2023 via ad sales, is being disrupted by AI-powered search tools such as Perplexity, and ChatGPT. While Google has built Gemini, a cutting edge AI search offering of its own, it does not currently offer a comparable monetization model. That said, Waymo has a 2x potential for Google. As shareholders eventually seek better returns on investments, we could see capital spending on GPU chips cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. Model Training Slowdown? Over the past two years, companies have heavily invested in AI model training, with Nvidia’s GPUs emerging as the top choice on account of their performance and efficiency. AI model training is a compute-intensive process that may eventually slow. Unlike traditional cloud growth, AI model training is compute-heavy but often front-loaded making a slowdown in future GPU demand quite possible. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger, and the availability of high-quality training data could become a bottleneck. As training demand declines, GPU demand could weaken. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. Compare evolution of Nvidia valuation over time. Building In House AI Chips At the same time, big tech giants aren’t relying solely on Nvidia - they are all actively developing their own custom AI chips. Google is building its TPU chips, while Amazon, Microsoft with Maia, and Meta too, have their own silicon developments focused on AI. While these chips have a long way to go to match Nvidia’s performance in compute heavy training tasks, they could be well optimized for their respective company's AI models and code. Moreover, by building their own chips, these companies could be looking to increase bargaining power with Nvidia and create some independence from Nvidia’s supply chain and pricing. Even if Nvidia maintains its technological edge, the concentration of its revenue in a handful of hyperscalers, who are both customers and emerging competitors, could be a vulnerability. Impact on Nvidia Stock NVIDIA's Revenues have surged by over 2x over the last year and are on track to grow by over 50% this year per consensus estimates. While the stock trades at above 40x estimated FY'26 earnings, this isn’t too high considering the company's growth rates. That said, these projections assume hyperscaler demand continues unabated. A pullback from any major customers - whether due to internal chip development, more cautious AI returns, or overall tech spending moderation – could lead to lower pricing, lower volumes, and a sharp erosion of profitability. This is especially critical for a company like Nvidia, where such a large share of revenue is tied to a handful of customers. This could lead to a sharp contraction in valuation multiples. The risks here aren't hypothetical, either. Recent evidence from 2022 shows that NVDA stock lost over 60% of its value within just a few quarters. In fact, the stock fell by close to 35% over Q1 2025 due to concerns about tariffs. This could very well repeat itself if big customers show signs of cutting back on spending. Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How to prep your Shopify or WooCommerce store for Black Friday before the rush starts

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Black Friday is the biggest rush of the year for most ecommerce businesses, and it is right around the corner. The most successful merchants prepare for Black Friday early and follow a structured plan to prepare their stores, ensure visibility, and convert first-time visitors into long-term customers. This guide breaks down your preparation into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each section builds on the last so that you can grow your readiness over time, regardless of your team size or budget. These actions lay the groundwork for everything else. Without these, no advanced strategy will stick. First impressions matter, and your metadata is the first thing users see in search results. So make it count and leave a lasting impact. Why it matters: Strong metadata can improve visibility and attract more clicks. When your titles and descriptions align with what shoppers seek, your chances of standing out rise significantly. Actionable tips: With Yoast SEO for Shopify and Yoast WooCommerce SEO, you can preview and improve your metadata in real time. The tools flag missing or duplicated fields and guide you on how to write content that earns clicks. Product pages are the moment of truth. They’re where curiosity turns into clicks and clicks turn into customers. Why it matters: No matter how great your traffic or ads are, most people will leave without buying if the product page feels confusing or incomplete. A well-structured page improves your chances of ranking in search and helps buyers feel confident in their decision. Actionable tips: Yoast WooCommerce SEO and Yoast SEO for Shopify help your product pages appear cleanly and clearly in search results. They add structured data behind the scenes and check your content for SEO and readability so you can focus on turning visitors into buyers. Internal linking guides customer to surface key pages, maps user behavior, and boosts your site’s SEO. Why it matters: Internal linking helps search engines understand your site structure, distributes authority to key pages, and guides visitors toward high-converting content. It keeps users engaged, supports SEO, and makes your promotions easier to surface across your site. Actionable tips: Yoast WooCommerce SEO offers internal linking suggestions as you write, making keeping your content connected and strategic easier. Once you have set up the basics, some steps can help you boost impact quicker and avoid costly missed opportunities. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Once the technical foundation is stable, it’s time to focus on your content and promotions. Site speed directly impacts user experience, especially during high-traffic periods like Black Friday. Slow-loading pages frustrate shoppers and lead to lost sales. Why it matters: A fast site supports smoother browsing and quicker checkout. Search engines consider page performance in rankings, and users are more likely to buy when the experience feels seamless. Actionable tips: While Yoast SEO is not a speed optimization tool, clean site structure and proper internal linking help improve crawlability and engagement, indirectly supporting performance. Your landing page is the command center for your seasonal promotions. It’s where visitors decide to browse further or bounce. Why it matters: A dedicated page gives your Black Friday campaign direction and cohesion. Instead of scattering your offers across the site, it provides a clear path for shoppers to follow. It simplifies navigation, allows for better internal linking, and gives you a consistent, trackable URL for email campaigns, ads, and site banners. Plus, it’s reusable! Just update the content each year. Actionable tips: Email isn’t just another marketing channel during Black Friday; it’s your direct line to customers ready to buy. Why it matters: Blasting the same message with monotonous tone to everyone no longer works. Crafting compelling emails with personalized messages that resonate with the reader is key to email marketing. People are more likely to open, click, and shop when an email speaks to their pain points and highlights the solution. A segmented email list means you’re talking to people based on what they care about: early access, bundles, or a product they viewed or left in their cart. Actionable tips: For more on syncing content and email, check out our basics of email marketing blog post. Buyers don’t always search for discounts. Many start with questions or ideas like “affordable gifts for coworkers” or “best tech gift under $100.” Why it matters: Helpful blog posts and gift guides pull in people who aren’t searching for your brand yet. These early touchpoints introduce your products and lead them toward your Black Friday offers. Actionable tips: Once your product pages are polished, tighten up the surrounding details. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Unlock powerful features and much more for your online store with Yoast WooCommerce SEO! If you’re already doing the essentials well, these strategies will help you scale. If you offer in-store pickup or have a physical store, don’t miss out on the people searching near you. Shoppers looking for same-day purchases often skip past online-only stores. Why it matters: When someone searches for a product near them, being present in the results can drive instant foot traffic and build trust before they even walk in. Actionable tips: Yoast Local SEO is included in the Yoast WooCommerce SEO. It helps you create and manage local schema and landing pages that appear in search. (It is not available for Shopify.) When someone searches for a product and your listing shows price, availability, or reviews, that’s not luck. That’s structured data. Why it matters: Rich snippets give your products more space in search results, credibility, and clicks. Actionable tips: Yoast SEO for Shopify and Yoast WooCommerce SEO automatically adds this, but you can also fine-tune it for special products or campaigns if needed. Black Friday may be over at checkout, but it’s just the beginning of your relationship with a new customer. Why it matters: People who buy during Black Friday often need reassurance and support. They’re far more likely to come back if they feel taken care of. Actionable tips: Taking care of this now means you can focus on fulfillment and service during the Black Friday rush. A thoughtful follow-up and last check make sure you build on opportunities and are ready for what might come your way. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Preparing for Black Friday is about being proactive, not reactive. Every SEO improvement you make now, from product pages to local visibility, will help you attract more shoppers and turn clicks into customers. Yoast gives you the tools to stay ahead: clearer product listings, stronger search visibility, and smart automations that scale with your store. Whether you’re using Shopify or WooCommerce, optimize now to be ready before the crowds arrive.

Title: One of Wall Street's biggest bulls sees tech powering an 11% gain in stocks through the rest of 2025
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-prediction-7000-ai-stocks-wells-fargo-2025-7

The US stock market looks like it's going to keep powering through to new records, says one of the biggest bulls on Wall Street. Christopher Harvey, the chief US equity strategist at Wells Fargo, predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 7,007 by the end of the year. His forecast — now one of the most optimistic on Wall Street — implies the benchmark index climbing another 11% from its current levels, or a 19% gain for the year. Speaking to Bloomberg about his thesis on Monday, Harvey pointed to a handful of reasons that would keep the market climbing higher: AI boom. Mega-cap tech stocks will likely keep climbing higher, Harvey said. He brushed off concerns that the hype over artificial intelligence resembled the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, noting that many companies today have stronger fundamentals. Large-cap tech and AI stocks have been on a tear since their low in early April, shortly after President Donald Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 41% from its April 8 low. "What we're seeing is the winners continue to win. The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trade in AI that will continue," Harvey said. Strong mergers and acquisition activity. Dealmaking has remained relatively strong on Wall Street, another factor that should support the market, Harvey said. Strategic M&A activity was up 11% year-over-year from January through May, according to an analysis from the consultancy Bain & Company. "We think that M&A will continue to be very, very healthy up and down the capitalization," Harvey added. The US consumer remains strong. Americans keep spending, despite concerns that tariff-related price increases could shut off an important engine of the economy. Consumers ramped up their spending more than expected last month, with retail sales rising 0.6%, according to the US Census Bureau. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates. The central bank looks on track to eventually lower interest rates despite hesitation stemming from President Donald Trump's tariffs in recent months. Investors are pricing in two or three rate cuts from the Fed by the end of 2025, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Those bullish factors override any concerns investors have over the market, Harvey said, pointing to concerns about the impact of tariffs and Trump's escalating feud with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Investors are worried that tariffs could raise inflation while hampering economic growth, and that Trump could interfere with the Fed's independence, which could stoke inflation down the line. "We had seen Trump 1.0. We know his style," Harvey said, referring to the belief that the president goes hard on his policies before softening his tone. Harvey was one of the few strategists on Wall Street who stuck to his original S&P 500 target for the year, even during the historic sell-off in April as Trump unveiled his slate of tariffs. Forecasters like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan lowered their stock forecasts and lifted their recession odds, before reversing once Trump paused most tariffs. Jump to

Title: VA – Paul Weller Presents That Sweet Sweet Music (2025)

Soul music has always been in Paul Weller’s blood from early Jam covers of Martha & the Vandellas 1963 classic ‘Heatwave’. Along with other forms of music, soul found its way into Paul’s record collection, nourishing his ears and informing his own songwriting. We don’t need to recap a questing musical career from the Jam to the Style Council which then blossomed into one of the most productive and revered careers of any UK solo artist. Paul has written anthems, standards and a songbook that have always developed from his own feelings. Whilst Paul has talked about his love of soul music he has, before now, simply been too busy to sit down and curate a collection of his favourite tracks and get it into the record racks. 199 MB 320 ** FLAC Ace Records are honoured and delighted to finally release that Paul Weller curated collection which he has aptly titled, “That Sweet Sweet Music”. This 2-LP set and CD open the curtains on 26 tracks that are some of Paul’s favourite soul records most of which nestle on vinyl in his own collection. He can still recall paying £70 for his copy of Jon Lucien’s 1971 ‘Search For The Inner Self’ 7” at a record shop in Leicester in the 90s. Some of these tracks are soul classics like James Carr’s 1966 ‘Pouring Water On A Drowning Man’ and Brother to Brother’s brilliant take on Gil Scott Heron and Brian Jackson’s ‘In The Bottle’ from 1975. Others are deliciously obscure wonderous gems like the A-side of Blackrock’s sole 1971 single ‘Blackrock “Yeah, Yeah”’, ‘Life Walked Out’ from the same year by The Mist or Syl Johnson’s ‘Black Balloons’ taken from his 1970 album “Is It Because I’m Black?”. There are plenty of big vocal hitters such as Darrell Banks, Spinners, Joe Simon, O.C. Smith, the Dells and Betty Davis. Whilst the core is vocal soul the music does branch out with Paul selecting a wicked instrumental from the flipside of the Isley Brothers’ ‘Twist & Shout’ from 1962 and the funky jazz of the Headhunters ‘God Made Me Funky’, the A-side of their first 1975 seven-inch. Paul has not only written an introduction but the way he has curated the music allows each side of the vinyl and the CD to flow like a river taking the listener on a journey through some of his favourite music. — acerecords.co.uk « The Boneshakers – Live to Be This (2025) Vanilla Fudge – Where Is My Mind?

Paul Reynolds Crime Correspondent A man aged in his 70s has appeared in court charged in connection with alleged historical sexual offences. Gardaí say the man was arrested this morning following his extradition from the United States. He is accused of 79 offences - 78 counts of indecently assaulting four young girls aged between eight and 14 at the time, and one count of attempting to rape one of the children. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1971 and 1981 at various locations in south Dublin including Dun Laoghaire, Killiney, Blackrock, Deansgrange, and Foxrock. 42 of the charges relate to one of the girls and 34 to another. Two indecent assault charges relate to another of the girls, while one charge relates to the fourth alleged victim. Sergeant Amy Kelly told the court that she arrested the man at Dublin airport at 5.56am following extradition. She said he was brought to Ballymun Garda Station where he was charged with the 79 offences. There was no application for bail and he was granted free legal aid. His solicitor Tracy Horan told the court that the 76-year-old was not working and had no assets. She also said he required medical assistance because he has no hearing aid and urgently needs dentures because he cannot eat. The man sat in a wheelchair in court and was dressed in a green top, grey shorts, white socks and tan slip-on shoes. He did not speak during the brief hearing. Judge Michelle Finan directed that he receive appropriate medical attention in custody and remanded him to appear again at Cloverhill District Court next Tuesday. Crime Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: 'Made for Germany': German Companies show optimism

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has joined forces with the country's top business leaders, who pledge major investments to pull Germany out of recession. There is always an element of psychology in economics. If companies are confident they can do good business in the future, they will strongly invest. If prospects look poor, they will hold on to the money. The COVID-19 pandemic with its collapse of international supply chains, the war in Ukraine, the subsequent energy crisis and inflation, the weakening economy in China — all took a heavy toll on the export-oriented German economy. Economic activity nosedived. Germany slid into a lasting recession. Since then, optimism has not returned. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) registered a lower investment ratio for Germany in 2024 than all other 38 member countries. That will soon change, according to the heads of leading companies in Germany. A total of 61 of them, including corporations such as Airbus, BASF, BMW, Deutsche Börse, Mercedes-Benz, Rheinmetall, SAP, Volkswagen but also the US corporations Nvidia, Blackrock and Blackstone — have launched the initiative "Made for Germany." The name is reminiscent, deliberately, of the slogan "Made in Germany" which has become a symbol of quality. Together, the corporations representing a third of the German economy want to invest €631 billion ($733 billion) in Germany over the next three years. The money will go toward new and existing factories, as well as research and development. "We want economic growth, we want to strengthen Germany's competitiveness, we want to defend our technological leadership or extend it further," one of the alliance's two initiators, Siemens chief executive Roland Busch, said following a meeting of the initiative with government politicians at the chancellery. Christian Sewing, chief executive of Deutsche Bank and co-initiator of the alliance alongside Busch, expects even more businesses to join. "Germany is back. It's worth investing in Germany again," said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) after the meeting, describing the situation as "one of the largest investment initiatives that we have seen here in Germany in recent decades. We are not a location of the past, but a location of the present and above all the future," he added. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The mood in the chancellery was clearly positive. However, the economic situation in Germany remains sluggish; the country is facing its third year in a row without growth. Given the tariff policies of US President Donald Trump, the outlook is anything but good. Reviving the economy is the top priority for Germany's new government. The coalition of the center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats has been in office since early May. They have made their first steps: The Bundestag federal parliament and Bundesrat upper house have authorized the borrowing of €500 billion ($580 billion) for a special fund for government investment in infrastructure and climate protection. Its intended focus is to whip the country's ailing transport routes into shape, invest in energy networks, digitization and research. Energy prices for the industry will be reduced, and businesses are set for massive tax relief. Initially, investment in production facilities, machinery, equipment, research and development will be accounted for during tax assessments. In the medium term, taxes on business are to be reduced. In Friedrich Merz, Germany now has a chancellor who himself spent many years in business. Among other roles, the lawyer formerly chaired the supervisory board of US financial investor BlackRock. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video "Today we have begun a new form of cooperation," Siemens head Busch said. "The conversation has shown that politics and business are on the same page." Deutsche Bank CEO Sewing added: "In my view, we are experiencing a government that is moving quickly. The most important things — growth and competitiveness — are right at the top of the agenda." To release the announced billions, politicians should ease up on regulations and give companies more freedom, Sewing said. Businesses are calling for reforms, especially concerning bureaucracy and social security contributions which push up the cost of labor. In Germany, employers and employees each pay half of worker contributions to health insurance, unemployment insurance and pensions. Due to higher costs for healthcare, health insurance contributions increased across the board at the beginning of this year. Contributions to long-term care insurance are expected to rise in 2026. In Germany, 42% of the gross national product goes toward social services. Pension funds are the biggest driver of this. Germany is an ageing society, and the baby boomer generation will retire from the workforce in the coming years. In addition, life expectancy is increasing. To afford the old-age pension, the government must contribute more money to the pension funds each year. According to the OECD, reforming social insurance is the biggest challenge for Germany. If nothing changes, the government will need to keep taking on more debt to keep social systems afloat. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced that reforming the social system is next on his coalition's political agenda. Initial findings are expected in the coming months.

Title: BlackRock Restricts Use of Company Devices for China Travel

BlackRock Inc. has told staff traveling to China for business trips to use temporary loaner phones and not to bring company laptops, underscoring growing concern among some global firms about employees working there. The world’s largest asset manager detailed the “policy enhancement” on business travel to China in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News, saying it is effective July 16. The US firm told staff that using BlackRock issued employee devices, including iPhones and iPads, isn’t permitted, according to the memo. Using BlackRock laptops or remote access via VPN will also not be allowed. Employees were notified they wouldn’t have access to the BlackRock network during personal travel in China. A BlackRock spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. The latest changes come amid growing jitters around business travel to China. Wells Fargo & Co. last week suspended travel to China after one of its top trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from leaving the country. This week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said the case was related to a criminal matter. China has also stopped an American citizen who works for the US Commerce Department from leaving the nation for several months, according to media reports. US-China geopolitical tensions have weighed on the global financial industry in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for firms to navigate. Global banks have scaled back their presence in China in the past few years amid slowing economic growth and escalating trade disputes. Since China tightened data security further with two new laws in 2021, global firms have focused on information segregation.

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. It doesn’t really matter who you are, how you spend your time online, or what you imagine your relationship with the internet to be. However you scroll, wherever you browse, and whatever you want to see on your screens, it has probably happened to you, and if you haven’t noticed yet, you may now: Your world has become more Reddit. The 20-year-old platform, which began as a niche link aggregator and gradually grew into the web’s default community of communities, has gone from optional to inescapable, its little red alien logo manifesting no matter which way you look. For my zoomer cousin, a professional TikToker who was still learning to read when Reddit was founded, it’s obviously “the only place where you know there are real people.” For 82-year-old user LogyBayer, who grew up programming FORTRAN on punch-card computers in the 1960s, Reddit, where he has posted thousands of times, is the closest thing he can find to “the wondrous world of Usenet,” the online discussion system that predates the web. Many of the less online people I know, who had maybe heard of Reddit, are now tapping through threads about life advice and HVAC repair; at the same time, some of the most online people I know, who for years saw Reddit as a sort of internet playpen, a meme aggregator downstream of more vital communities, are now logging in daily. It’s happened to me, too, a screen-addled tech reporter who has been covering the platform’s growth — and various problems — for well over a decade with at least notional remove: When it’s time again to pick up that phone and incinerate a few more seconds of my one life on earth, more often than not, I shovel them into Reddit. This isn’t just a feeling. Reddit, after two decades of gradual and uneven growth, is exploding. According to Similarweb, it’s one of the largest properties online; if you take away social apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, and utilities like Google and ChatGPT, its closest competition among websites is Wikipedia. In 2023, according to the company, Reddit had around 60 million unique visitors a day; its latest earnings report puts the number at 108 million a day, 400 million a week, and, according to conservative estimates, well over a billion different people using it every month. About those earnings reports: In 2024, Reddit went public. Its stock price popped, then climbed alongside its traffic. Revenue is way up, and after years of losses, the company eked out a slim profit in the last quarter. Why now? Reddit’s co-founder and current CEO, Steven Huffman, suggests the answer is obvious. “When we started Reddit, it was a web page of 25 links from around the internet,” he says. “Now, 20 years later, you’re stumbling into some thread where people are telling stories they’ve never told before and it drifts into life advice for someone who lives 2,000 miles away.” He didn’t see that coming, he says, but “in hindsight, it actually makes a lot of sense.” For years, Reddit, which is made up of thousands of sub-Reddits moderated by volunteers, offered a centralized and streamlined alternative to the web’s thousands of small and scattered forums, message boards, and independent communities. At the same time, in contrast with the much larger social-media platforms that rose around it, it looked niche. “The word social media didn’t exist” when the site was launched, Huffman says. Since then, in his telling, the company has steered away from influencer culture and growth-at-all-costs social-media scaling — “we don’t want people to be famous because of Reddit,” he says — and toward realizing “the vision of the old web.” Another way to tell the story is that the platform largely just stayed put. In any case, as the mega-platforms merge into TikTok-clone sameness, Reddit’s steady focus on giving online randos a place to pseudonymously post with one another is paying off. In Huffman’s view, Reddit’s growth is simply its reward for stubbornly — maybe accidentally — “fulfilling the promise of the internet.” It’s a good story, and there’s something to it. But just out of frame, there are … a few other relevant things happening online, each as obvious to the typical browser as Reddit’s sudden come-up. The World Wide Web from which Reddit grew, and for which Huffman expresses so much reverence, has been going through something akin to ecological collapse after being poisoned, then abandoned, by advertisers that have little use for independent websites anymore. At the same time, the rise of generative AI suggests a lot of people are just as happy — if not happier — getting life advice, news, and conversation from a robot that has read a bunch of sub-Reddits as they are chatting with internet strangers themselves. Reddit’s place in the collapsing web is both valuable and risk-laden. Google’s response to the gradual breakdown of the digital commons has been to send more and more people to Reddit, where relevant results are at least probably written by human beings, lavishing the site with traffic but binding the companies’ fates together. Reddit’s relationship with AI is similarly tense: As a training corpus, Reddit is immensely valuable; after years of unauthorized scraping, the company has official licensing deals with Google, which sometimes turns its content into AI-generated search “Answers,” and with OpenAI, which uses Reddit’s vast archives to give its chatbot depth and outside sourcing and to help it sound like a normal person — or at least a normal redditor. Meanwhile, Reddit moderators are battling a flood of inauthentic content generated by chatbots that were trained, of course, on Reddit. They’re getting tired while users, less certain that other commenters are real — and less sure of their ability to tell and noticing the rising tides of slop elsewhere — are drifting into mutual suspicion. Huffman suggests that, just as Reddit was rewarded for offering an alternative to more baldly growth-and-ad-driven social media, it could serve a similar role in the post-ChatGPT world as a refuge for actual human interaction in a sea of generated text. “Social media made Reddit make more sense, and I think now that the web is kind of dying, sadly, that evolution helps Reddit make more sense,” he says. “Reddit in that era is, Reddit is not social media. And now, we’re entering this new era where Reddit is not AI.” It’s a powerful pitch, to the extent it remains true. But it doesn’t quite capture just how strange and risky Reddit’s position is in 2025. Being one of the last islands of humanity on a dying web may make you more appealing to, well, humans. But it also makes you even more valuable to the companies doing the killing. Reddit is an alternative to a web that’s harvested, polluted, and depleted by tech firms in a race to dominate AI. It’s also an increasingly valuable data source for tech firms in a race to dominate AI. How long can it be both? Reddit has occupied a series of strange, sometimes contradictory positions in the public imagination over its 20 years of existence: a nerdier alternative to Digg, whose users it inherited after a redesign gone wrong; a platform overwhelmed by young men who were, at different times, in the tank for Ron Paul, Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders; the world’s leading aggregator of revenge porn; a crusading platform against revenge porn; and a staging ground for Donald Trump’s online campaign, among many others. At different times, and to different people, it was an obscure “dark corner” of the web, an unbearably “cringe” platform downstream from real internet culture (akin to 4chan or, actually, its polar opposite); a platform of free-speech crusaders; a hive of groupthink and censorship; and ground zero for an ongoing retail stock-trading boom that has since outgrown it. Through it all, the platform has remained in some ways remarkably consistent. (As the critic Alex Pareene wrote a few years ago, Reddit went “from merely embarrassing but occasionally amusing, to actively harmful, to — mainly by accident — essential.”) In 2005, Reddit looked a lot like it does now, a list of links on which users voted up or down. By 2008, it worked a lot like it does now, with comments, sub-Reddits created and run by the community, and the rise of self-posts — threads without links, created to talk, argue, or share things directly. To a user in 2008, Reddit was legible as a forum of forums, a new and centralized take on the sorts of scattered web communities where people used to spend a lot of time on a much smaller internet. To a user in 2025, this can make it feel like a throwback. We’re further from Reddit’s founding than Reddit’s founding was from the creation of the web browser. It still basically operates within structures and norms established on dial-up bulletin-board services and email lists: communities sorted by interest, volunteer policing, and threads upon threads of text. Reddit’s formal and cultural stubbornness — and its roots as a mid-aughts gathering place for (mostly) young men interested in technology and the stunted online culture of the time — has helped and haunted it for its entire existence. Huffman, who co-founded the site with his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, and the late activist Aaron Swartz, left the company after it was acquired by Condé Nast in 2009. (In 2011, Condé Nast spun off Reddit into an investable subsidiary of Advance Publications. Its $10 million investment would eventually be worth more than $2 billion.) Huffman returned in 2015 after a series of user and moderator revolts driven, in part if not completely, by the attempts of CEO Ellen Pao to figure out what to do about growing communities with names like Jailbait, Pics of Dead Kids, Fat People Hate, and Beating Women. He did so with a mandate to square the platform’s need for growth with the desires of a user base that was incredibly allergic to being told by the company what it could and couldn’t do. “It’s kind of an egotistical thought,” Huffman told New York Magazine at the time, “but I felt like I’m literally the only person in the world who can fix this and I had a moral obligation to do so.” There was resistance within the company, too. “Huffman stepped into what was basically a company on fire and was met by employees who were either disgruntled, burned out, or just done with the drama,” says Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, author of We Are the Nerds, a book about Reddit’s history. “Half the staff left within days.” This was, in hindsight, the beginning of a long process of growth-and-revenue-oriented taming and professionalization with occasional top-down mandates and a few more user revolts — the most recent in 2023 after the company limited access to developers, threatening third-party apps and tools used by moderators, resulting in mass sub-Reddit blackouts and a moderator exodus. The company by turns tolerated, managed, or crushed user backlash on the way to the big prize: Reddit’s IPO. In May 2024, shares in Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, its $34 listing price valuing the company at $6.5 billion. In July 2025, shares trade above $150. “It’s almost as if he made a list of all the things that had haunted Reddit as a site for years and built systems to dismantle them,” Lagorio-Chafkin says of Huffman. In person and as the trollish and frequently maligned “spez” on Reddit, he served for years as a representative of and foil for some of the site’s most vocal (or at least stereotypical) users: a millennial white-guy programmer who enjoys arguing a little too much for his own good. Post-IPO, Huffman is now much wealthier — his shares in the company are worth north $600 million — and, as is customary in his San Francisco cohort, conspicuously muscular. After years of corporate expansion, Reddit is starting to resemble the larger tech companies he likes to use as foils. In 2015, when he returned, Reddit had fewer than 75 employees. Now, it has more than 2,300 staffers and a market cap of $28 billion. It’s also — finally — turning a profit. It would be an overstatement to say Reddit’s transition into a publicly traded online platform was smooth. “We’ve lost a lot of moderator skill since the IPO,” says one longtime volunteer who communicates regularly with Reddit’s leadership. These tens of thousands of moderators aren’t just helpful — they’re operationally crucial, keeping the site organized and (relatively) hospitable. The 2023 revolt drove a lot of people out, and the loss of third-party tools for dealing with the workload was a pain for the ones who remained. (At the time, Huffman compared protesting mods to entitled “landed gentry”; among volunteers, the episode is still referred to as “fuck spez.”) Before Reddit developed its own replacement tools, another moderator tells me, “We had a solid year of unchecked spam hitting all sub-Reddits.” At the same time, mods were dealing with a new problem: AI. “With text-only subs, we see increased attempts by people generating fake stories,” the moderator says, and discerning the difference between AI posts and typical Reddit comments was suddenly much harder. Image-based sub-Reddits, suddenly glutted with generated material, scrambled to come up with rules — “constantly disputed,” the mod says — and struggled to enforce them. Suddenly, spammers and trolls had superpowers. Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Zurich dispatched “semi-automated, AI-powered accounts,” which identified themselves variously as rape victims, trauma counselors, and Black men opposed to Black Lives Matter, to a sub-Reddit called /r/changemyview, where the researchers claimed they achieved “persuasive rates between three and six times higher than the human baseline,” leaving users annoyed and moderators enraged. (A majority of the accounts used in the study, however, were flagged at the time by Reddit’s automated systems.) Meanwhile, the longtime mod says, recruiting new help has gotten harder. “People hate you. The people who want to do it are power hungry, and the really good ones burn out.” They also have somewhat less control than they used to (they can no longer lock down their sub-Reddits in protest, for example). “I think the company is under a lot of pressure to remove power for moderators,” he says. “I need more people, but Reddit would like people to have less power.” Laura Nestler, Reddit’s VP of community, says managing mods is crucial to the platform’s survival. “They’re stewarding their communities, they’re building the norms, building the rules and enforcing their independent individual rules,” she says. “Our goal is just to empower moderators and communities to do what they’re gonna do.” Mod drama isn’t a sideshow. Like Wikipedia, Reddit works only if people feel like posting there and if moderators feel like volunteering hours a week — or a day — to keep things clean, civil, or at least functional. Unlike Wikipedia, Reddit is a for-profit company, which makes its volunteer model fragile in different ways. (For an idea of what happens when your army of volunteer contributors loses interest in boosting your company’s bottom line, look no further than the rotting corpse of Quora.) Before the IPO, Reddit offered some longtime moderators early access to its stock. Now that they’re volunteering for a public company, though, some are floating another idea: Maybe they’ll need to get paid. Still, the transition happened, and the admin-mod-user relationship that keeps Reddit running remains more or less intact. “I think what’s underappreciated is that he continued what Ellen started,” Lagorio-Chafkin says — cracking down on hate speech and harassment and building “sturdier internal teams.” As a result, she suggests, Reddit is far larger, more functional, and more diverse than ever, with sub-Reddits for just about any pastime or interest you might come up with, often filled with more people than you might expect. According to the company, Reddit is now used by slightly more women than men, and, unlike a lot of other large platforms, its share of young users is growing. Fandoms have sub-Reddits, and so do brands. The platform functions broadly enough to host, for example, a massive sub-Reddit for Uber-rider stories and complaints (“Driver picked me up with her infant and boyfriend in the car”) as well as a sub-Reddit with more than 420,000 subscribers for Uber drivers (“She peed herself in my car. I can’t blame her”). Any sufficiently popular sub-Reddit eventually spawns a “circlejerk” counterpart in which users mock the host sub-Reddit. Reddit is also far more international despite English still being the dominant language. It’s not uncommon, particularly in sub-Reddits devoted to personal stories and advice, to realize that the difficult in-laws in question live in Bhopal or that the requested product recommendations need to be available for purchase in Jakarta. More surprising, perhaps, is the persistence of one of Reddit’s less publicized functions, even through its IPO and efforts to court mainstream advertisers: There are still massive amounts of porn on it with thousands of sub-Reddits filled with just about any sort of adult content you can think of and quite a bit more. The largest isn’t even an aggregator: On /r/gonewild, which has more than 5 million subscribers, redditors post nude photos of themselves. Plenty of the dynamics resemble, as Huffman suggests, an extension of the “old web” ethos of community and connection, albeit enabled by new internet techniques. Once built purely around a unified front page and followed sub-Reddits, users now get algorithmic recommendations. As with any such system, this has the effect of making the platform feel larger and, at times, more isolating. There are also more ads than there used to be (Reddit’s revenue last year was just $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion of which came from advertising). Still, from the inside, Reddit remains recognizably Reddit. Strains of its dominant 2010s culture have become less important if not less obvious, aging and mutating with some of its most devoted longtime users. There are plenty of kids there talking about kid things, and a surprising number of elderly people, too, but there are also, unmistakably, a ton of American college-educated millennials, many of whom now have jobs and children and whose once-nerdy interests and sensibilities have become, with some help from Reddit itself, genuinely mainstream — so much so that the site’s name on the platform and elsewhere has become a pejorative shorthand for normie millennial tastes. There are large and active conservative and pro-Trump sub-Reddits, but the largest and most extreme MAGA communities have been officially banned by the company or marginalized in the community, meaning America’s dominant political movement is rendered on the platform’s most popular sub-Reddits as an absurd and enraging external force and as fundamentally incompatible even with Reddit’s commercialized approximation of a shared, deliberative commons. Posts fishing for earnest responses from Trump supporters are more likely to be answered by young liberal redditors venting about their parents. Years of failed attempts to create a conservative alternative to Reddit have instead culminated with a migration back to X, with which Reddit is now engaged in a sort of simmering mega-scale forum war. (Early this year, Elon Musk lashed out at Reddit, where some sub-Reddits had banned links to X, and privately pressured Huffman to step in.) One way to understand Reddit is as a largely functional, self-sustaining community that its leadership managed to avoid fucking up — an old and sturdy system that remains, against all odds, basically intact. But this alone doesn’t explain its growth or the situation it finds itself in now. For Reddit to grow as it has — suddenly and massively despite largely staying the course — it required some help. First, it needed the web to collapse around it and social networks to chase TikTok into video-recommendation oblivion, leaving readers desperate for anything resembling actual human discussion. Then it needed Google. In 2019, on the tech-industry Reddit clone Hacker News, users discussed a blog post about missing the “old internet,” pining for the days before it was ruined by the “commercial smog thrown up by Google.” Multiple commenters shared the same advice: “I’ve taken to appending ‘reddit’ to many of my search queries, because flawed though it is, Reddit is one of the few places you can read an actual human thought,” one wrote. Sure, Reddit was still a “cesspool,” full of bullshitters and tiresome “in-jokes” of its own, commenters said, but the advice was well received — and prescient. Reddit users shared the tip, the company itself publicized it, and the “reddit” hack went mainstream. By 2022, Google had taken notice and adjusted its search algorithms in a way that surfaced Reddit more often, particularly in response to open-ended questions, and said it would guide users toward “helpful content” and more “first-person perspectives.” By 2023, search analysts were tracking dramatic increases in Reddit’s visibility on Google; one report estimated that Reddit had gone from “57 million visits from Google U.S. … in July 2023 to 427 million in April 2024.” Reddit’s own numbers told a similar story: The mature, newly public company, which had been fighting for incremental growth its whole life, was suddenly tracking like a viral start-up, its total traffic growing yearly by half with no signs of slowing down. At first in its earnings reports, the company was slightly coy about what was going on, emphasizing how important Reddit had become to Google, not the other way around. (“Reddit was the sixth-most-Googled word in the U.S.,” Huffman noted at the time.) Reddit’s disclosures told the story more clearly: It reported that logged-in users — i.e., people who already had Reddit accounts — were up 27 percent globally, while its logged-out visitor numbers were up 70 percent. There are plenty of reasons the internet feels more Reddit these days, but none are as important, nor as straightforward, as this: Google, in an effort to cope with its own rotting search index, has been sending us there by the hundred million. In an interview, Huffman emphasized that this isn’t entirely new and that Google has been sending people to Reddit in unpredictable quantities for years: “We get a ton of traffic from Google today. We know that’s not forever. We’ve seen it in our history. It comes and goes.” While a recent collapse in Google traffic has been a disaster for e-commerce operations and online publishers, Huffman says, such changes wouldn’t be a disaster because — again — Reddit remains Reddit. “We have a lot of content that Google likes, and the reason Google likes it is because we didn’t generate it for them,” he says. But without the massive assist from Google, the past few years of Reddit’s story look quite different. Adam Bumas, an analyst with research firm Garbage Media, has been tracking upvotes on popular sub-Reddits since Reddit shut off access for most outside tracking tools. Despite the influx of new visitors, this sort of active participation has remained flat — a story, Bumas says, of “maintaining rather than growing.” Without Google’s firehose of visitors, other risks come to the fore: competition from platforms like Discord, the real-time chat platform popular with younger users, where many sub-Reddits already have a presence; the growing preference among advertisers for video rather than text; and, of course, the rise of chatbots. There are also reasons to suspect that, today, Reddit’s past relationship with Google may not be a reliable guide. Google’s uses for Reddit aren’t just about search, nor have they been merely convenient: In February 2024, the company announced it was “expanding its partnership” with Google, allowing for “new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products” but also for Google — which was by then spending tens of billions of dollars a quarter pivoting to AI — to train its models on Reddit’s vast corpus of “authentic human conversations and experiences.” For Google, spooked by the rise of ChatGPT, this was urgent. By May, it had rolled out AI-generated “answers” above its search results, many of which were clearly drawn from the platform, but which, by design, were far less likely to send users there. When the feature made headlines for a viral AI-generated search result that suggested adding glue to a pizza recipe, the backstory implicated Reddit: Google’s AI had misread an 11-year-old joke from a Reddit user called “fucksmith.” It was funny, of course, but also told a particular story about the future of the platform. Reddit — the last website, the imperfect and commercially conflicted steward of the “promise of the internet” — was being harvested to train tools that purport to be able to do a lot of what Reddit users do for one another: answer questions, provide recommendations, open rabbit holes, indulge argument, and waste time. It was training its own replacement. From inside the platform, Reddit’s relationship with AI is unremarkable. There are large active communities of AI enthusiasts sharing productivity hacks as well as sub-Reddits full of apocalyptic doomers, sci-fi optimists, and total skeptics. Users routinely call out comments that appear to be AI-generated and lament the rise of AI slop outside of Reddit’s (relatively) safe perimeter. Moderators see a rise in AI-generated engagement bait and comments — more, they say, than Huffman admits — but they don’t see it as a crisis, at least not yet. As a business, Reddit has been pushing further into AI-powered moderation and has polled users about AI content-creation tools. With users, it has moved cautiously, launching an internal AI search tool that lets users browse threads through a chat interface. To advertisers, it has been a little more aggressive, pitching them an “AI-powered social listening tool designed to unlock strategic value from Reddit’s 20 years of conversations.” But Reddit’s careful approach to AI features is misleading: Except for Wikipedia, maybe, no independent website has provided as much raw training data for as many AI firms, authorized or not, as Reddit. As a corpus for machines trying to sound or reason like people, it’s immensely valuable: pre-organized, pre-moderated, cleaned and sorted by the input of millions of volunteers and users, and written, unlike so much else on the web, without SEO, traffic, or advertisers in mind. Likewise, its relationship with OpenAI runs deeper than the deal announced in early 2024 through which Reddit licensed data to OpenAI for training and to bring Reddit content directly into ChatGPT. In 2015, the day after OpenAI was founded, Sam Altman, in a joint interview with Musk, mused that “all of the Reddit data would be a very useful training set” for building future AI; earlier that year, Altman, who had by then known Huffman for a decade, helped orchestrate his return as CEO but not before serving as CEO himself for a week. Altman was an early investor in Reddit and sat on its board until 2022. Huffman, who still regularly speaks with Altman, is hardly an AI skeptic. But when it comes to AI’s impact on Reddit — at least in his capacity as a CEO — he’s fairly sanguine about the future. “There are times the AI is superpowerful, and there are times when you just don’t want it,” he says. Sure, some of what people get from Reddit, they may soon be able to get from chatbots trained on it. “It can give you lots of decent answers to a wide variety of questions,” Huffman says. And there’s no doubt AI will rip through the economy of the web, which is already filled with cheap and largely replaceable content. “AI is going to kill the bullshit because AI is better at bullshit,” he adds. Reddit has plenty of bullshit too. But a lot of questions brought to Reddit, Huffman says, are questions without clear answers — the sorts of questions where, even if you’re not asking them yourself, you’re there to read what other people think, work things through, argue, and joke around. “I think what will stay constant is that human beings want to talk to each other,” he says. “People like talking. They like asking questions, they like hearing answers, they like giving answers, they like having a few laughs, they like being helpful.” The big social platforms don’t offer that anymore, and chatbots can’t either. “The core of Reddit actually becomes more valuable over time when the rest of the internet turns into AI.” In the background, though, Reddit has started acting a bit more paranoid. As a measure against bot-generated content, Reddit is reportedly considering partnering with World ID, an iris-scanning crypto and identity start-up (started, of course, by Sam Altman). The company recently sued OpenAI competitor Anthropic for allegedly scraping its “vast corpus of public content” for its “enormous utility” and has threatened to sue the university researchers who ran the undercover AI experiment. Meanwhile, brands, advertisers, and spammers are reportedly swarming the platform hoping to cash in on Reddit’s visibility in both Google Search and in AIs trained on and monitoring its posts. As insular and resilient as Reddit has been, it’s a resource that needs to be maintained and one that could be depleted. The through-line in Reddit’s history is that it has always been forced to answer to its users and thousands of volunteer moderators, whether or not what they were demanding made sense for Reddit as a community or a company. In some ways, this dynamic surely held them back. But just as clearly, in hindsight, it probably kept the entire project alive. Huffman likes to emphasize that Reddit has been through a lot. When it launched, nobody was using the internet on smartphones, and the tiny company saw MySpace, Friendster, and Xanga as unassailable incumbents. It watched as they collapsed and were replaced with true giants, which shape-shifted as they grew, all the while remaining fundamentally and stubbornly the same. “Look, we’ve been around 20 years,” he says. “So we have, I think, some perspective and comfort with the way the internet evolves.” When I ask about risks, he spins to synergies. The trashing of the web, the lavish attention from Google and AI firms, the scrutiny of investors who care about returns above all — these are fundamentally aligned with Reddit’s interests and will carry it to the next billion users. Huffman is more optimistic than ever about Reddit’s internal tensions, too, having gotten, in his view, the platform’s worst instincts under control. He recalls with clear satisfaction a recent conversation with a longtime moderator: “He’s like, ‘As a shareholder, how are you thinking about growth?’ And I was just like, Oh, hallelujah.” Reddit’s most devoted volunteers, he says, “used to tell us not to grow.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

It needs to do something big to be a real player in that area, and a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ticket required, according to Melius Research. Apple has repeatedly delayed promised AI updates to Siri, its digital assistant. That has undercut hopes that such an upgrade could revive growth in iPhone revenue, which has stagnated since hitting $205 billion in Apple’s fiscal 2022. Apple shares were down 16% this year as of Friday’s close. The prospect that Apple will be able to deliver an impressive AI-enabled iPhone on its own is becoming more remote. The company recently lost one of its top AI researchers—Ruoming Pang, who led its machine-learning foundation model team—to Meta Platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means the focus is on Apple’s potential to strike a deal with an external AI partner. Melius’s Ben Reitzes says Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally it needs. “Apple could provide xAI with the users it needs to top [ChatGPT developer] OpenAI in return for giving Apple all the benefits of owning an LLM [large language model] without the capex," wrote Reitzes in a research note on Monday. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on its AI plans. Any AI deal that Apple strikes with a third party risks its lucrative relationship with Alphabet’s Google, in which the iPhone marker receives a percentage of the ad revenue from searches on its devices. The arrangement, which makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices, led to a $20 billion payment from Google to Apple in 2022, according to court filings. However, the Google-Apple deal is already at risk, with a judge currently considering potential curbs on the search-engine company after ruling last year in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department that it had acted as a monopolist. That could make the time ripe to look elsewhere. A deal offering Apple a cut of subscriptions to xAI’s products could offset a loss of revenue from the Google deal. One drawback of a partnership with xAI would be to leave Apple dependent on an external partner and a controversial one at that, with xAI’s Grok chatbot having recently published a number of antisemitic posts. The company subsequently removed the posts and said they were the result of unauthorized changes made to the chatbot. Apple’s preference for tight control over its platforms could mean it prefers to buy an AI provider. The search specialist Perplexity is a potential target frequently mentioned by analysts. Acquiring Perplexity could cost Apple more than $20 billion, considering its latest valuation of around $18 billion, but would likely still boost its shares, according to Reitzes. The Melius analyst calculates that if 100 million Apple users bought Perplexity’s Pro Tier subscription at $200 a year, that would completely cancel out the potential loss of Google payments. “Tim Cook and his team are likely to be rewarded for thinking bolder to accelerate Apple’s AI push, even if they have to step out of their comfort zone," Reitzes wrote. News Corp, the owner of Barron’s publisher Dow Jones, has sued Perplexity, alleging copyright infringement. News Corp also signed a multiyear partnership with OpenAI in March 2024. The stock was up 1.3% at $213.97 in early trading. Reitzes has a Buy rating and $240 target price on the stock.

Title: Stocks to Buy | India's Growth Engine: Why small & midcaps will lead the charge

Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital in an interview to ET Now said that India has always been and will continue to be a small and midcap-driven market. While largecaps form the core of a portfolio, he believes that real wealth is created when investors identify and nurture promising companies early. According to him, this space consistently offers greater upside potential for those willing to hold with conviction. Nilesh Shah asserts that stock picking remains an eternal truth in investing. Regardless of whether one is investing in largecaps, midcaps, or smallcaps, careful selection of stocks is vital. He stresses that this principle holds true for all types of investors and professionals, including fund managers and CIOs. In his view, India’s diverse market provides an unmatched canvas for skilled stock pickers. Nilesh Shah points out that India’s market includes over 4,000 to 5,000 listed companies, a result of past conditions where high interest rates and underdeveloped VC/PE ecosystems pushed companies to go public early. He notes that only around 200 qualify as largecaps and a similar number as midcaps, leaving a massive small and microcap base. For Shah, this vast investable universe is a unique strength of the Indian market. According to Nilesh Shah, India’s continued economic growth—6–7% real and around 10% nominal—supports the long-term outperformance of mid and smallcap companies. He argues that as India moves from a $3,000 to $9,000–$10,000 per capita income, these companies are poised to benefit the most. Shah believes short-term corrections are insignificant if one keeps the long-term growth narrative in mind. Nilesh Shah observes that the last few years have seen a historic wave of IPOs, particularly in the mid and smallcap segments. He explains that earlier, many IPOs were premature due to capital constraints, but now companies are entering the market at a more stable stage. For Shah, this evolution has enriched the mid and smallcap ecosystem and created better long-term investment opportunities. Nilesh Shah highlights a major shift post-COVID, where a new class of tech-driven businesses has gone public. From online broking to food delivery and insurance platforms, he notes that these firms are leveraging technology to reach consumers faster and scale efficiently. According to Shah, these developments make the mid and smallcap space increasingly dynamic and future-ready. Nilesh Shah acknowledges that while some IPOs came with high valuations, subsequent corrections have offered buying opportunities. He advises that investors who have done their homework could take advantage of such dips. Although today’s IPOs may not be as attractively priced as in the past, Shah believes they still offer high-quality growth stories for long-term investors. Nilesh Shah concludes that India’s mid and small-cap universe is rich with long-term potential. He urges investors to look beyond short-term volatility and instead focus on structural growth trends, digital transformation, and strategic stock selection. Shah remains confident that these segments will continue to drive market performance over the coming decade.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Hey! Before we go any further — if you want to support my work, please sign up for the premium version of Where’s Your Ed At, it’s a $7-a-month (or $70-a-year) paid product where every week you get a premium newsletter, all while supporting my free work too. Also, subscribe to my podcast Better Offline, which is free. Go and subscribe then download every single episode. One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it's accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming. And I am alarmed. Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it's convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money. I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as "optimists," which typically means "people that agree with what the market wishes were true." Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there's something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics "do this for clicks" or "to be a contrarian." I don't do anything for clicks. I don't have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because "AI is big," but I've been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the anti-remote work push (and the people behind it), the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble, the NFT bubble, the made-up quiet quitting panic, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished, called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded. This isn't "contrarianism." It's the kind of skepticism of power and capital that's necessary to meet these moments, and if it's necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest. Nevertheless, I am alarmed, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it's necessary to say why. In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say "the AI bubble," I mean the entirety of the AI trade. And it's alarmingly simple, too. But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply worrisome. I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s been so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure. I may not be a contrarian, but I am a hater. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer excitement that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so. And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it. No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t fucking work and will never fucking work. I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat. Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something. As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from the DeepSeek situation in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA's market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested. Back in May, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) alone make up 42.4% of NVIDIA's revenue. The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA's revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA's climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, in the last quarter, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA missed, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (. Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion from this category, and NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion. Then again, it could be attributed to its problems in China, especially as the H20 ban has only just been lifted. In any case, it was a miss! NVIDIA's quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn't bad (it's pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, it's a pretty big concern, at least for me. Look, I'm not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple: In simpler terms, 35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. If NVIDIA's growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories. And, as you will shortly find out, there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money. I'm so tired of people telling me that companies are "making tons of money on AI." Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion. This is egregiously fucking stupid. As of January 2025, Microsoft's "annualized" — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it's either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings. Yet the problem with this revenue is that $10 billion of that revenue, according to The Information, comes from OpenAI's spend on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and Microsoft offers preferential pricing — "a heavily discounted rental rate that essentially only covers Microsoft's costs for operating the servers" according to The Information. In simpler terms, 76.9% of Microsoft's AI revenue comes from OpenAI, and is sold at just above or at cost, making Microsoft's "real" AI revenue about $3 billion, or around 3.75% of this year's capital expenditures, or 16.25% if you count OpenAI's revenue, which costs Microsoft more money than it earns. The Information reports that Microsoft made $4.7 billion in "AI revenue" in 2024, of which OpenAI accounted for $2 billion, meaning that for the $135.7 billion that Microsoft has spent in the last two years on AI infrastructure, it has made $17.7 billion, of which OpenAI accounted for $12.7 billion. Things do not improve elsewhere. An analyst estimates that Amazon, which plans to spend $105 billion in capital expenditures this year, will make $5 billion on AI in 2025, rising, and I quote, "as much as 80%," suggesting that Amazon may have made a measly $2.77 billion in 2024 on AI in a year when it spent $83 billion in capital expenditures. [editor's note: this piece originally said "$1 billion" instead of "$2.77 billion" due to a math error, sorry!] Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." I think he's full of shit. Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated a few weeks ago that Google's AI revenue would be in the region of $7.7 billion, though his math is, if I'm honest, a little generous: Google's "One" subscription includes increased cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos, and added a $20-a-month "premium" plan in February 2024 that included access to Google's various AI models. Google has claimed that the "premium AI tier accounts for millions" of the 150 million subscribers to the service, though how many millions is impossible to estimate — but that won't stop me trying! Assuming that $3.1 billion in 2025 revenue would work out to $258 million a month, that would mean there were 12.9 million Google One subscribers also paying for the premium AI tier. This isn't out of the realm of possibility — after all, OpenAI has 15.5 million paying subscribers — but Post is making a generous assumption here. Nevertheless, we'll accept the numbers as they are. And the numbers fuckin' stink! Google's $1.1 billion in workspace service revenue came from a forced price-hike on those who use Google services to run their businesses, meaning that this is likely not a number that can significantly increase without punishing them further. $7.7 billion of revenue — not profit! — on $75 billion of capital expenditures. Nasty! Someone's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but I believe that Meta is simply burning cash on generative AI. There is no product that Meta sells that monetizes Large Language Models, but every Meta product now has them shoved into them, such as your Instagram DMs oinking at you to generate artwork based on your conversation. Nevertheless, we do have some sort of knowledge of what Meta is saying due to the copyright infringement case Kadrey v. Meta. Unsealed judgment briefs revealed in April that Meta is claiming that "GenAI-driven revenue will be more than $2 billion," with estimates as high as $3 billion. The same document also claims that Meta expects to make $460 billion to $1.4 trillion in total revenue through 2035, the kind of thing that should get you fired in an iron ball into the sun. Meta makes 99% of its revenue from advertising, and the unsealed documents state that it "[generates] revenue from [its] Llama models and will continue earning revenue from each iteration," and "share a percentage of the revenue that [it generates] from users of the Llama models...hosted by those companies," with the companies in question redacted. Max Zeff of TechCrunch adds that Meta lists host partners like AWS, NVIDIA, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake, so it's possible that Meta makes money from licensing to those companies. Sadly, the exhibits further discussing these numbers are filed under seal. Either way, we are now at $332 billion of capital expenditures in 2025 for $28.7 billion of revenue, of which $10 billion is OpenAI's "at-cost or just above cost" revenue. Not great. Despite its prominence in the magnificent 7, Tesla is one of the least-exposed of the magnificent 7 to the AI trade, as Elon Musk has turned it into a meme stock company. That doesn't mean, of course, that Musk isn't touching AI. xAI, the company that develops racist Large Language Model "Grok" and owns what remains of Twitter, apparently burns $1 billion a month, and The Information reports that it makes a whopping $100 million in annualized revenue — so, about $8.33 million a month. There is a shareholder vote for Tesla to potentially invest in xAI, which will probably happen, allowing Musk to continue to pull leverage from his Tesla stock until the company's decaying sales and brand eventually swallow him whole. But we're not talking about Elon Musk today. Apple Intelligence radicalized millions of people against AI, mostly because it fucking stank. Apple clearly got into AI reluctantly, and now faces stories about how they "fell behind in the AI race," which mostly means that Apple aggressively introduced people to the features of generative AI by force, and it turns out that people don't really want to summarize documents, write emails, or make "custom emoji," and anyone who thinks they would is a fucking alien. In any case, Apple hasn't bet the farm on AI, insomuch as it hasn't spent two hundred billion dollars on infrastructure for a product with a limited market that only loses money. To be clear, I am not saying that any of the Magnificent 7 are going to die — just that five companies' spend on NVIDIA GPUs largely dictate how stable the US stock market will be. If any of these companies (but especially NVIDIA) sneeze, your 401k or your kid’s college fund will catch a cold. I realize this sounds a little simplistic, but by my calculations, NVIDIA's value underpins around 8% of the value of the US stock market. At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies' spend makes up 42% of its revenue. In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market. NVIDIA's earnings are, effectively, the US stock market's confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we're honest, really four companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, don't produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth. Silence! Any of these companies talking about "growth from AI" or "the jobs that AI will replace" or "how AI has changed their organization" are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them. If they were making good money and experiencing real growth as a result of these services, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about it! They'd be in your ear and up your ass hooting about how much cash they were rolling in! And they're not, because they aren't rolling in cash, and are in fact blowing nearly a hundred billion dollars each to build massive, power-hungry, costly data centers for no real reason. Don’t watch the mouth — watch the hands. These companies are going to say they’re seeing growth from AI, but unless they actually show you the growth and enumerate it, they are hand-waving. So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it sounds rational. Amazon did lose money, and Amazon Web Services was expensive, that’s obvious, right? The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that. This isn't Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur! I will address both the argument itself and the "they" part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future. Right? So, I'm honestly not sure where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon. But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called "Amazon.bomb," and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for "being wrong" about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable. I also want to be clear that Amazon Web Services didn't launch until 2006, and Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003. Technically Amazon had opened up Amazon.com's web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006. But okay, what did she actually say? Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up: Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn't that what Amazon was building was a bad idea, but that Amazon wouldn't be the ones to build it, with one saying: In simpler terms: Amazon's business model wasn't in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point. Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked. Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon's own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world's most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing. It's actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It invented the modern concept of compute! But we're here to talk about Amazon Web Services being dangerous for Amazon and people hating on it. A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about Jeff Bezos' Risky Bet to "run your business with the technology behind his web site," saying that "Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store." Bezos, referred to as a "one-time internet poster boy" that became "a post-dot-com piñata." Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave: Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad! Except it's not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! Emphasis mine: That's right — the ongoing costs aren't the problem. Hey wait a second, that's a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god, just read this: The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would "gain." In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI, but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year. Palantir also, as discovered by the Autonomy Institute’s recent study, recently added to the following to its public disclosures: What I'm saying is that analysts can be wrong! And they can be wrong at scale! There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth! Yet even in this Hater's Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case for Amazon Web Services: Nice try, chuckles! In 2015, the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed that it was running at a "material loss," suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon's "technology and content expenses" was actually AWS expenses, with a "negative contribution of $1.3 billion." Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that "2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners." So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services absolutely created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. From Forbes’s Chuck Jones: In today's money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn't, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit. That's $15.4 billion less than Amazon's capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that even when factoring in inflation, Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025. Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so. Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I'm diluting this) Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon's servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed and the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). This is a huge industry. Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024, and while Microsoft and Google don't break out their cloud revenues, they're similarly large parts of their revenue, and Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth. These services are also selling infrastructure. You aren't just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point. Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware and make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don't have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand. There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you. Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs? Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it's largely impossible for others to even enter the market. Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a feature of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that's about it. You can run lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed "next big thing"? Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. So, okay, let's humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they're the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure. One small problem. Let's start by establishing a few facts: None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn't a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, this is chump change. Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year. We're three years in, and generative AI's highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI ($10 billion annualized as of early June) and Anthropic ($4 billion annualized as of July), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems: But let's start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue. Pretty great, right? It hit $200 million in annualized revenue in March, then hit $500 million annualized revenue in June after raising $900 million. That's amazing! Sadly, it's a mirage. Cursor's growth was a result of an unsustainable business model that it’s now had to replace with opaque terms of service, dramatically restricted access to models, and rate limits that effectively stop its users using the product at the price point they were used to. It’s also horribly unprofitable, and a sign of things to come for generative AI. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote up the dramatic changes that Cursor made to its service in the middle of June on my premium newsletter, and discovered that they timed precisely with Anthropic (and OpenAI to a lesser extent) adding "service tiers" and "priority processing," which is tech language for "pay us extra if you have a lot of customers or face rate limits or service delays." These price shifts have also led to companies like Replit having to make significant changes to its pricing model that disfavor users. I will now plagiarise myself: In simpler terms, Cursor raised $900 million and very likely had to hand large amounts of that money over to OpenAI and Anthropic to keep doing business with them, and then immediately changed its terms of service to make them worse. As I said at the time: Cursor is the largest and most-successful generative AI company, and these aggressive and desperate changes to its product suggest A) that its product is deeply unprofitable and B) that its current growth was a result of offering a product that was not the one it would sell in the long term. Cursor misled its customers, and its current revenue is, as a result, highly unlikely to stay at this level. Worse still, the two Anthropic engineers who left to join Cursor two weeks ago just returned to Anthropic. This heavily suggests that whatever they saw at Cursor wasn’t compelling enough to make them stay. As I also said: I realize it's likely a little boring hearing about software as a service, but this is the only place where generative AI can really make money. Companies buying hundreds or thousands of seats are how industries that rely upon compute grow, and without that growth, they're going nowhere. To give you some context, Netflix makes about $39 billion a year in subscription revenue, and Spotify about $18 billion. These are the single-most-popular consumer software subscriptions in the world — and OpenAI's 15.5 million subscribers suggest that it can't rely on them for the kind of growth that would actually make the company worth $300 billion (or more). Cursor is, as it stands, the one example of a company thriving using generative AI, and it appears its rapid growth was a result of selling a product at a massive loss. As it stands today, Cursor's product is significantly worse, and its Reddit is full of people furious at the company for the changes. In simpler terms, Cursor was the company that people mentioned to prove that startups could make money by building products on top of OpenAI and Anthropic's models, yet the truth is that the only way to do so and grow is to burn tons of money. While the tempting argument is to say that Cursor’s "customers are addicted," this is clearly not the case, nor is it a real business model. This story also showed that Anthropic and OpenAI are the biggest threats to their customers, and will actively rent-seek and punish their success stories, looking to loot as much as they can from them. To put it bluntly: Cursor's growth story was a lie. It reached $500 million in annualized revenue selling a product it can no longer afford to sell, suggesting material weakness in its own business and any and all coding startups. It is also remarkable — and a shocking failure of journalism — that this isn’t in every single article about Anysphere. I'm serious! Perplexity? Perplexity only has $150 million in annualized revenue! It spent 167% of its revenue in 2024 ($57m, its revenue was $34m) on compute services from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon! It lost $68 million! And worse still, it has no path to profitability, and it’s not even anything new! It’s a search engine! Professional gasbag Alex Heath just did a flummoxing interview with Perplexity CEO Aravind Srivinas, who, when asked how it’d become profitable, appeared to experience a stroke: Aravind, do you smell toast? And don’t talk to me about “AI browsers,” I’m sorry, it’s not a business model. How are people going to make revenue on this, hm? What do these products actually do? Oh they can poorly automate accepting LinkedIn invites? It’s like God himself has personally blessed my computer. Big deal! In any case, it doesn't seem like you can really build a consumer AI startup that makes anything approaching a real company. Other than ChatGPT, I guess? Arguably the biggest sign that things are troubling in the generative AI space is that we use "annualized revenue" at all, which, as I've mentioned repeatedly, means multiplying a month by 12 and saying "that's our annualized!" The problem with this number is that, well, people cancel things. While your June might be great, if 10% of your subscribers churn in a bad month (due to a change in your terms of service), that's a chunk of your annualized revenue gone. But the worst sign is that nobody is saying the monthly figures, mostly because the monthly figures kinda suck! $100 million of annualized revenue is $8.33 million a month. To give you some scale, Amazon Web Services hit $189 million ($15.75 million a month) in revenue in 2008, two years after founding, and while it took until 2015 to hit profitability, it actually hit break-even in 2009, though it invested cash in growth for a few years after. Right now, not a single generative AI software company is profitable, and none of them are showing the signs of the kind of hypergrowth that previous "big" software companies had. While Cursor is technically "the fastest growing SaaS of all time," it did so using what amounts to fake pricing. You can dress this up as "growth stage" or "enshittification (it isn't by the way, generally price changes make things profitable, which this did not)," but Cursor lied. It lied to the public about what its product would do long-term. It isn't even obvious whether its current pricing is sustainable. Outside of Cursor, what other software startups are there? Glean? Everyone loves to talk about enterprise search company Glean — a company that uses AI to search and generate answers from your company's files and documents. In December 2024, Glean raised $260 million, proudly stating that it had over $550 million of cash in hand with "best-in-class ARR growth." A few months later in February 2025, Glean announced it’d "achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue in fourth quarter FY25, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups and reflecting a surging demand for AI-powered workplace intelligence." In this case, ARR could literally mean anything, as it appears to be based on quarters — meaning it could be an average of the last three months of the year, I guess? Anywho, in June 2025, Glean announced it had raised another funding round, this time raising $150 million, and, troublingly, added that since its last round, it had "...surpassed $100M in ARR." Five months into the fucking year and your monthly revenue is the same? That isn't good! That isn't good at all! Also, what happened to that $550 million in cash? Why did Glean need more? Hey wait a second, Glean announced its raise on June 18 2025, two days after Cursor's pricing increase and the same day that Replit announced a similar hike! It's almost as if its pricing dramatically increased due to the introduction of Anthropic's Service Tiers and OpenAI's Priority Processing. I'm guessing, but isn't it kind of weird that all of these companies raised money about the same time? Hey, that reminds me. If you look at what generative AI companies do (note that the following is not a quality barometer), it's probably doing one of the following things: Every single generative AI company that isn't OpenAI or Anthropic does one or a few of these things, and I mean every one of them, and it's because every single generative AI company uses Large Language Models, which have inherent limits on what they can do. LLMs can generate, they can search, they can edit (kind of!), they can transcribe (sometimes accurately!) and they can translate (often less accurately). As a result, it's very, very difficult for a company to build something unique. Though Cursor is successful, it is ultimately a series of system prompts, a custom model that its users hate, a user interface and connections to models by OpenAI and Anthropic, both of whom have competing products and make money from Cursor and its competitors. Within weeks of Cursor's changes to its services, Amazon and ByteDance released competitors that, for the most part, do the same thing. Sure there's a few differences in how they're designed, but design is not a moat, especially in a high-cost, negative-profit business, where your only way of growing is to offer a product you can't afford to sustain. The only other moat you can build..is the services you provide, which, when your services are dependent on a Large Language Model, are dependent on the model developer, who, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic, could simply clone your startup, because the only valuable intellectual property is theirs. You may say "well, nobody else has any ideas either," to which I'll say that I fully agree. My Rot-Com Bubble thesis suggests we're out of hypergrowth ideas, and yeah, I think we're out of ideas related to Large Language Models too. At this point, I think it's fair to ask — are there any good companies you can build on top of Large Language Models? I don't mean add features related to, I mean an AI company that actually sells a product that people buy at scale that isn't called ChatGPT. In previous tech booms, companies would make their own “models” — their own infrastructure, or the things that make them distinct from other companies — but the generative AI boom effectively changes that by making everybody build stuff on top of somebody else’s models, because training your own models is both extremely expensive and requires vast amounts of infrastructure. As a result, much of this “boom” is about a few companies — really two, if we’re honest — getting other companies to try and build functional software for them. I wanted to add one note — that, ultimately, OpenAI and Anthropic are bad for their customers. Their models are popular (by which I mean their customers' customers will expect access to them) meaning that OpenAI and Anthropic can (as they did with Cursor) arbitrarily change pricing, service availability or functionality based on how they feel that day. Don't believe me? Anthropic cut off access to AI coding platform Windsurf because it looked like it might get acquired by OpenAI. Even by big tech standards this fucking sucks. And these companies will do it again! Because all Large Language Models require more data than anyone has ever needed, they all basically have to use the same data, either taken from the internet or bought from one of a few companies (Scale, Surge, Turing, Together, etc.). While they can get customized data or do customized training/reinforcement learning, these models are all transformer-based, and they all function similarly, and the only way to make them different is by training them, which doesn't make them much different, just better at things they already do. I already mentioned OpenAI and Anthropic's costs, as well as Perplexity's $50 million+ bill to Anthropic, Amazon and OpenAI off of a measly $34 million in revenue. These companies cost too much to run, and their functionality doesn't make enough money to make them make sense. The problem isn't just the pricing, but how unpredictable it is. As Matt Ashare wrote for CIO Dive last year, generative AI makes a lot of companies’ lives difficult through the massive spikes in costs that come from power users, with few ways to mitigate their costs. One of the ways that a company manages their cloud bills is by having some degree of predictability — which is difficult to do with the constant slew of new models and demands for new products to go with them, especially when said models can (and do) cost more with subsequent iterations. As a result, it's hard for AI companies to actually budget. "But Ed!" you cry, "What about AGENTS?" Let me tell you about agents. The term "agent" is one of the most egregious acts of fraud I've seen in my entire career writing about this crap, and that includes the metaverse. When you hear the word "agent," you are meant to think of an autonomous AI that can go and do stuff without oversight, replacing somebody's job in the process, and companies have been pushing the boundaries of good taste and financial crimes in pursuit of them. Most egregious of them is Salesforce's "Agentforce," which lets you "deploy AI agents at scale" and "brings digital labor to every employee, department and business process." This is a blatant fucking lie. Agentforce is a god damn chatbot platform, it's for launching chatbots, they can sometimes plug into APIs that allow them to access other information, but they are neither autonomous nor "agents" by any reasonable definition. Not only does Salesforce not actually sell "agents," its own research shows that agents only achieve around a 58% success rate on single-step tasks, meaning, to quote The Register, "tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information." On multi-step tasks — so, you know, most tasks — they succeed a depressing 35% of the time. Last week, OpenAI announced its own "ChatGPT agent" that can allegedly go "do tasks" on a "virtual computer." In its own demo, the agent took 21 or so minutes to spit out a plan for a wedding with destinations, a vague calendar and some suit options, and then showed a pre-prepared demo of the "agent" preparing an itinerary of how to visit every major league ballpark. In this example's case, "agent" took 23 minutes, and produced arguably the most confusing-looking map I've seen in my life. It also missed out every single major league ballpark on the East Coast — including Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park — and added a random stadium in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. What team is that, eh Sam? The Deepwater Horizon Devils? Is there a baseball team in North Dakota? I should also be clear this was the pre-prepared example. As with every Large Language Model-based product — and yes, that's what this is, even if OpenAI won't talk about what model — results are extremely variable. Agents are difficult, because tasks are difficult, even if they can be completed by a human being that a CEO thinks is stupid. What OpenAI appears to be doing is using a virtual machine to run scripts that its models trigger. Regardless of how well it works (it works very very poorly and inconsistently), it's also likely very expensive. In any case, every single company you see using the word agent is trying to mislead you. Glean's "AI agents" are chatbots with if-this-then-that functions that trigger events using APIs (the connectors between different software services), not taking actual actions, because that is not what LLMs can do. ServiceNow's AI agents that allegedly "act autonomously and proactively on your behalf" are, despite claiming they "go beyond ‘better chatbots,’" still ultimately chatbots that use APIs to trigger different events using if-this-then-that functions. Sometimes these chatbots can also answer questions that people might have, or trigger an event somewhere. Oh, right, that's the same thing. The closest we have to an "agent" of any kind is a coding agent, which can make a list of things that you might do on a software project and then go and generate the code and push stuff to Github when you ask them to, and they can do so "autonomously," in the sense that you can let them just run whatever task seems right. When I say "ask them to" or "go and" I mean that these agents are not remotely intelligent, and when let run rampant fuck up everything and create a bunch of extra work. Also, a study found that AI coding tools made engineers 19% slower. Nevertheless, none of these products are autonomous agents, and anybody using the term agent likely means "chatbot." And it's working because the media keeps repeating everything these companies say. I realize we've taken kind of a scenic route here, but I needed to lay the groundwork here, because I am well and truly alarmed. According to a UBS report from the 26th of June, the public companies running AI services are making absolutely pathetic amounts of money from AI: ServiceNow's use of "$250 million ACV" — so annual contract value — may be one of the more honest explanations of revenue I've seen, putting them in the upper echelons of AI revenue unless, of course, you think for two seconds, whether these are AI-specific contracts. Or, perhaps, are they contracts including AI? Eh, who cares. It's also year-long agreements that could churn, and according to Gartner, over 40% of "agentic AI" projects will be canceled by end of 2027. And really, ya gotta laugh at Adobe and Salesforce, both of whom have talked so god damn much about generative AI and yet have only made around $100 million in annualized revenue from it. Pathetic! These aren't futuristic numbers! They're barely product categories! And none of this seems to include costs. Oh well. I haven't really spent time on my favourite subject — OpenAI being a systemic risk to the tech industry. To recap: Anthropic is in a similar, but slightly better position — it is set to lose $3 billion this year on $4 billion of revenue. It also has no path to profitability, recently jacked up prices on Cursor, its largest customer, and had to put restraints on Claude Code after allowing users to burn 100% to 10,000% of their revenue. These are the actions of a desperate company. Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic's revenues amount to, by my estimates, more than half of the entire revenue of the generative AI industry, including the hyperscalers. To be abundantly clear: the two companies that amount to around half of all generative artificial intelligence revenue are ONLY LOSING MONEY. I've said a lot of this before, which is why I'm not harping on about it, but the most important company in the entire AI industry needs to convert by the end of the year or it's effectively dead, and even if it does, it burns billions and billions of dollars a year and will die without continual funding. It has no path to profitability, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar or a fantasist. Worse still, outside of OpenAI...what is there, really? As I wrote earlier in the year, there is really no significant adoption of generative AI services or products. ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework. Sidebar: Google cheated by combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant to claim that it has 350 million users. Don't care, sorry. This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said "AI" in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can't scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry. I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT's users, and I quote myself here: It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. ChatGPT is a very successful growth product and an absolutely horrifying business. OpenAI is a banana republic that cannot function on its own, it does not resemble Uber, Amazon Web Services, or any other business in the past other than WeWork, the other company that SoftBank spent way too much money on. And outside of ChatGPT, there really isn't anything else. Before I wrap up — I'm tired, and I imagine you are too — I want to address something. Yes, generative AI has functionality. There are coding products and search products that people like and pay for. As I have discussed above, none of these companies are profitable, and until one of them is profitable, generative AI-based companies are not real businesses. In any case, the problem isn't so much that LLMs "don't do anything," but that people talk about them doing things they can't do. I believe that the generative AI market is a $50 billion revenue industry masquerading as a $1 trillion one, and the media is helping. As I've explained at length, the AI trade is not one based on revenue, user growth, the efficacy of tools or significance of any technological breakthrough. Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they'd be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that's the case. OpenAI is a terrible business, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it. Large Language Models are too expensive to run, and have limited abilities beyond the ones I've named previously, and because everybody is running models that all, on some level, do the same thing, it's very hard for people to build really innovative products on top of them. And, ultimately, this entire trade hinges on GPUs. CoreWeave was initially funded by NVIDIA, its IPO funded partially by NVIDIA, NVIDIA is one of its customers, and CoreWeave raises debt on the GPUs it buys from NVIDIA to build more data centers, while also using the money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA. This isn’t me being polemic or hysterical — this is quite literally what is happening, and how CoreWeave operates. If you aren’t alarmed by that, I’m not sure what to tell you. Elsewhere, Oracle is buying $40 billion in GPUs for the still-unformed Stargate data center project, and Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data center to fill with NVIDIA GPUs. OpenAI is Microsoft's largest Azure client — an insanely risky proposition on multiple levels, not simply in the fact that it’s serving the revenue at-cost but that Microsoft executives believed OpenAI would fail in the long term when they invested in 2023 — and Microsoft is NVIDIA's largest client for GPUs, meaning that any changes to Microsoft's future interest in OpenAI, such as reducing its data center expansion, would eventually hit NVIDIA's revenue. Why do you think DeepSeek shocked the market? It wasn't because of any clunky story around training techniques. It was because it said to the market that NVIDIA might not sell more GPUs every single quarter in perpetuity. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla aren't making much money from AI — in fact, they're losing billions of dollars on whatever revenues they do make from it. Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around "being an AI company," which means absolutely jack shit when you don't have the users, finances, or products to back them up. So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA's ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we're really honest, at this point only exists to do so. Generative AI products do not provide significant revenue growth, its products are not useful in the way that unlocks significant business value, and the products that have some adoption run at such a grotesque loss. I realize I've thrown a lot at you, and, for the second time this year, written the longest thing I've ever written. But I needed to write this, because I'm really worried. We're in a bubble. If you do not think we're in a bubble, you are not looking outside. Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Slok said it last week. Well, okay, what he said was much worse: We are in a bubble. Generative AI does not do the things that it's being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren't the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn't there, the users aren't there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it's impossible to tell how they'll survive. Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans. There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs. There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI. Before you ask- You do not have proof for this statement! The cost of tokens going down is not the same thing as the cost of inference goes down! Everyone saying this is saying it because a guy once said it to them! You don't have proof! I have more proof for what I am saying! While it theoretically might be, all evidence points to larger models costing more money, especially reasoning-heavy ones like Claude Opus 4. Inference is not the only thing happening, and if this is your one response, you are a big bozo and doofus and should go back to making squeaky noises when you see tech executives or hear my name. Okay, so one argument is that these companies will use ASICs — customized chips for specific operations — to reduce the amount they're spending. A few thoughts: I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times claims everybody is using AI for everything — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere. Other than the frog thing, I'm not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus. Worse still, despite NVIDIA's strength, NVIDIA is the market's weakness, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they're buying start making them a profit. And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way. If you're going to say I'm wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don't want me to be right? Is it because you think "these companies will work it out"? This isn't anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by a tech industry that's run out of ideas, built on top of one company. You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You've probably read the "My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts" blog, and if you're gonna send it to me, read the response from Nik Suresh first. If you're going to say that I "don't speak to people who actually use these products," you are categorically wrong and in denial. I am only writing with this aggressive tone because, for the best part of two years, I have been made to repeatedly explain myself in a way that no AI "optimist" is made, and I admit I resent it. I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and still, to this day, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I'm missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case. The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making "powerful AI." And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology. I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot. I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not outright lie about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets and the media for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of "agents" that will never exist. Everything I’m discussing is the result of the Rot Economy thesis I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, both. Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically GPUs. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to do the thing that worked before — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed. I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn't believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who "don't understand AI," you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn't that good or you're not good at explaining why it's good. Perhaps it's both. If you want to know my true agenda, it's that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others. There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don't, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it's part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what's going on. To quote my editor Matt Hughes: "...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst." I haven't quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of Business Idiots that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of futurity, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what's happening in the tech industry. And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth. I love writing, but I don't love writing this. I think I'm right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about. If I'm wrong, I'll explain how I'm wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that's why I'm so alarmed. What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company's ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars. At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won't even be sales slowing — maybe it'll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won't be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I really, really don't know how I'm wrong. I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that so many people have lost their jobs because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there are people responsible. Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable. And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers, and I now have 67,000 and a growing premium subscriber base. I am grateful for the time you’ve given me, and really hope that I continue to help you see the tech industry for what it currently is — captured almost entirely by people that have no interest in building the future.

Also, subscribe to my podcast Better Offline, which is free. Go and subscribe then download every single episode. One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it's accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming. And I am alarmed. Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it's convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money. I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as "optimists," which typically means "people that agree with what the market wishes were true." Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there's something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics "do this for clicks" or "to be a contrarian." I don't do anything for clicks. I don't have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because "AI is big," but I've been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the anti-remote work push (and the people behind it), the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble, the NFT bubble, the made-up quiet quitting panic, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished, called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded. This isn't "contrarianism." It's the kind of skepticism of power and capital that's necessary to meet these moments, and if it's necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest. Nevertheless, I am alarmed, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it's necessary to say why. In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say "the AI bubble," I mean the entirety of the AI trade. And it's alarmingly simple, too. But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply worrisome. I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s been so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure. I may not be a contrarian, but I am a hater. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer excitement that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so. And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it. No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t fucking work and will never fucking work. I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat. Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something. As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from the DeepSeek situation in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA's market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested. Back in May, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) alone make up 42.4% of NVIDIA's revenue. The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA's revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA's climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, in the last quarter, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA missed, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (. Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion from this category, and NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion. Then again, it could be attributed to its problems in China, especially as the H20 ban has only just been lifted. In any case, it was a miss! NVIDIA's quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn't bad (it's pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, it's a pretty big concern, at least for me. Look, I'm not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple: In simpler terms, 35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. If NVIDIA's growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories. And, as you will shortly find out, there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money. I'm so tired of people telling me that companies are "making tons of money on AI." Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion. This is egregiously fucking stupid. As of January 2025, Microsoft's "annualized" — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it's either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings. Yet the problem with this revenue is that $10 billion of that revenue, according to The Information, comes from OpenAI's spend on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and Microsoft offers preferential pricing — "a heavily discounted rental rate that essentially only covers Microsoft's costs for operating the servers" according to The Information. In simpler terms, 76.9% of Microsoft's AI revenue comes from OpenAI, and is sold at just above or at cost, making Microsoft's "real" AI revenue about $3 billion, or around 3.75% of this year's capital expenditures, or 16.25% if you count OpenAI's revenue, which costs Microsoft more money than it earns. The Information reports that Microsoft made $4.7 billion in "AI revenue" in 2024, of which OpenAI accounted for $2 billion, meaning that for the $135.7 billion that Microsoft has spent in the last two years on AI infrastructure, it has made $17.7 billion, of which OpenAI accounted for $12.7 billion. Things do not improve elsewhere. An analyst estimates that Amazon, which plans to spend $105 billion in capital expenditures this year, will make $5 billion on AI in 2025, rising, and I quote, "as much as 80%," suggesting that Amazon may have made a measly $2.77 billion in 2024 on AI in a year when it spent $83 billion in capital expenditures. [editor's note: this piece originally said "$1 billion" instead of "$2.77 billion" due to a math error, sorry!] Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." I think he's full of shit. Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated a few weeks ago that Google's AI revenue would be in the region of $7.7 billion, though his math is, if I'm honest, a little generous: Google's "One" subscription includes increased cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos, and added a $20-a-month "premium" plan in February 2024 that included access to Google's various AI models. Google has claimed that the "premium AI tier accounts for millions" of the 150 million subscribers to the service, though how many millions is impossible to estimate — but that won't stop me trying! Assuming that $3.1 billion in 2025 revenue would work out to $258 million a month, that would mean there were 12.9 million Google One subscribers also paying for the premium AI tier. This isn't out of the realm of possibility — after all, OpenAI has 15.5 million paying subscribers — but Post is making a generous assumption here. Nevertheless, we'll accept the numbers as they are. And the numbers fuckin' stink! Google's $1.1 billion in workspace service revenue came from a forced price-hike on those who use Google services to run their businesses, meaning that this is likely not a number that can significantly increase without punishing them further. $7.7 billion of revenue — not profit! — on $75 billion of capital expenditures. Nasty! Someone's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but I believe that Meta is simply burning cash on generative AI. There is no product that Meta sells that monetizes Large Language Models, but every Meta product now has them shoved into them, such as your Instagram DMs oinking at you to generate artwork based on your conversation. Nevertheless, we do have some sort of knowledge of what Meta is saying due to the copyright infringement case Kadrey v. Meta. Unsealed judgment briefs revealed in April that Meta is claiming that "GenAI-driven revenue will be more than $2 billion," with estimates as high as $3 billion. The same document also claims that Meta expects to make $460 billion to $1.4 trillion in total revenue through 2035, the kind of thing that should get you fired in an iron ball into the sun. Meta makes 99% of its revenue from advertising, and the unsealed documents state that it "[generates] revenue from [its] Llama models and will continue earning revenue from each iteration," and "share a percentage of the revenue that [it generates] from users of the Llama models...hosted by those companies," with the companies in question redacted. Max Zeff of TechCrunch adds that Meta lists host partners like AWS, NVIDIA, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake, so it's possible that Meta makes money from licensing to those companies. Sadly, the exhibits further discussing these numbers are filed under seal. Either way, we are now at $332 billion of capital expenditures in 2025 for $28.7 billion of revenue, of which $10 billion is OpenAI's "at-cost or just above cost" revenue. Not great. Despite its prominence in the magnificent 7, Tesla is one of the least-exposed of the magnificent 7 to the AI trade, as Elon Musk has turned it into a meme stock company. That doesn't mean, of course, that Musk isn't touching AI. xAI, the company that develops racist Large Language Model "Grok" and owns what remains of Twitter, apparently burns $1 billion a month, and The Information reports that it makes a whopping $100 million in annualized revenue — so, about $8.33 million a month. There is a shareholder vote for Tesla to potentially invest in xAI, which will probably happen, allowing Musk to continue to pull leverage from his Tesla stock until the company's decaying sales and brand eventually swallow him whole. But we're not talking about Elon Musk today. Apple Intelligence radicalized millions of people against AI, mostly because it fucking stank. Apple clearly got into AI reluctantly, and now faces stories about how they "fell behind in the AI race," which mostly means that Apple aggressively introduced people to the features of generative AI by force, and it turns out that people don't really want to summarize documents, write emails, or make "custom emoji," and anyone who thinks they would is a fucking alien. In any case, Apple hasn't bet the farm on AI, insomuch as it hasn't spent two hundred billion dollars on infrastructure for a product with a limited market that only loses money. To be clear, I am not saying that any of the Magnificent 7 are going to die — just that five companies' spend on NVIDIA GPUs largely dictate how stable the US stock market will be. If any of these companies (but especially NVIDIA) sneeze, your 401k or your kid’s college fund will catch a cold. I realize this sounds a little simplistic, but by my calculations, NVIDIA's value underpins around 8% of the value of the US stock market. At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies' spend makes up 42% of its revenue. In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market. NVIDIA's earnings are, effectively, the US stock market's confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we're honest, really four companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, don't produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth. Silence! Any of these companies talking about "growth from AI" or "the jobs that AI will replace" or "how AI has changed their organization" are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them. If they were making good money and experiencing real growth as a result of these services, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about it! They'd be in your ear and up your ass hooting about how much cash they were rolling in! And they're not, because they aren't rolling in cash, and are in fact blowing nearly a hundred billion dollars each to build massive, power-hungry, costly data centers for no real reason. Don’t watch the mouth — watch the hands. These companies are going to say they’re seeing growth from AI, but unless they actually show you the growth and enumerate it, they are hand-waving. So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it sounds rational. Amazon did lose money, and Amazon Web Services was expensive, that’s obvious, right? The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that. This isn't Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur! I will address both the argument itself and the "they" part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future. Right? So, I'm honestly not sure where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon. But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called "Amazon.bomb," and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for "being wrong" about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable. I also want to be clear that Amazon Web Services didn't launch until 2006, and Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003. Technically Amazon had opened up Amazon.com's web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006. But okay, what did she actually say? Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up: Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn't that what Amazon was building was a bad idea, but that Amazon wouldn't be the ones to build it, with one saying: In simpler terms: Amazon's business model wasn't in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point. Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked. Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon's own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world's most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing. It's actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It invented the modern concept of compute! But we're here to talk about Amazon Web Services being dangerous for Amazon and people hating on it. A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about Jeff Bezos' Risky Bet to "run your business with the technology behind his web site," saying that "Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store." Bezos, referred to as a "one-time internet poster boy" that became "a post-dot-com piñata." Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave: Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad! Except it's not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! Emphasis mine: That's right — the ongoing costs aren't the problem. Hey wait a second, that's a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god, just read this: The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would "gain." In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI, but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year. Palantir also, as discovered by the Autonomy Institute’s recent study, recently added to the following to its public disclosures: What I'm saying is that analysts can be wrong! And they can be wrong at scale! There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth! Yet even in this Hater's Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case for Amazon Web Services: Nice try, chuckles! In 2015, the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed that it was running at a "material loss," suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon's "technology and content expenses" was actually AWS expenses, with a "negative contribution of $1.3 billion." Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that "2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners." So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services absolutely created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. From Forbes’s Chuck Jones: In today's money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn't, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit. That's $15.4 billion less than Amazon's capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that even when factoring in inflation, Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025. Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so. Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I'm diluting this) Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon's servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed and the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). This is a huge industry. Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024, and while Microsoft and Google don't break out their cloud revenues, they're similarly large parts of their revenue, and Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth. These services are also selling infrastructure. You aren't just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point. Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware and make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don't have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand. There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you. Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs? Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it's largely impossible for others to even enter the market. Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a feature of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that's about it. You can run lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed "next big thing"? Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. So, okay, let's humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they're the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure. One small problem. Let's start by establishing a few facts: None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn't a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, this is chump change. Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year. We're three years in, and generative AI's highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI ($10 billion annualized as of early June) and Anthropic ($4 billion annualized as of July), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems: But let's start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue. Pretty great, right? It hit $200 million in annualized revenue in March, then hit $500 million annualized revenue in June after raising $900 million. That's amazing! Sadly, it's a mirage. Cursor's growth was a result of an unsustainable business model that it’s now had to replace with opaque terms of service, dramatically restricted access to models, and rate limits that effectively stop its users using the product at the price point they were used to. It’s also horribly unprofitable, and a sign of things to come for generative AI. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote up the dramatic changes that Cursor made to its service in the middle of June on my premium newsletter, and discovered that they timed precisely with Anthropic (and OpenAI to a lesser extent) adding "service tiers" and "priority processing," which is tech language for "pay us extra if you have a lot of customers or face rate limits or service delays." These price shifts have also led to companies like Replit having to make significant changes to its pricing model that disfavor users. I will now plagiarise myself: In simpler terms, Cursor raised $900 million and very likely had to hand large amounts of that money over to OpenAI and Anthropic to keep doing business with them, and then immediately changed its terms of service to make them worse. As I said at the time: Cursor is the largest and most-successful generative AI company, and these aggressive and desperate changes to its product suggest A) that its product is deeply unprofitable and B) that its current growth was a result of offering a product that was not the one it would sell in the long term. Cursor misled its customers, and its current revenue is, as a result, highly unlikely to stay at this level. Worse still, the two Anthropic engineers who left to join Cursor two weeks ago just returned to Anthropic. This heavily suggests that whatever they saw at Cursor wasn’t compelling enough to make them stay. As I also said: I realize it's likely a little boring hearing about software as a service, but this is the only place where generative AI can really make money. Companies buying hundreds or thousands of seats are how industries that rely upon compute grow, and without that growth, they're going nowhere. To give you some context, Netflix makes about $39 billion a year in subscription revenue, and Spotify about $18 billion. These are the single-most-popular consumer software subscriptions in the world — and OpenAI's 15.5 million subscribers suggest that it can't rely on them for the kind of growth that would actually make the company worth $300 billion (or more). Cursor is, as it stands, the one example of a company thriving using generative AI, and it appears its rapid growth was a result of selling a product at a massive loss. As it stands today, Cursor's product is significantly worse, and its Reddit is full of people furious at the company for the changes. In simpler terms, Cursor was the company that people mentioned to prove that startups could make money by building products on top of OpenAI and Anthropic's models, yet the truth is that the only way to do so and grow is to burn tons of money. While the tempting argument is to say that Cursor’s "customers are addicted," this is clearly not the case, nor is it a real business model. This story also showed that Anthropic and OpenAI are the biggest threats to their customers, and will actively rent-seek and punish their success stories, looking to loot as much as they can from them. To put it bluntly: Cursor's growth story was a lie. It reached $500 million in annualized revenue selling a product it can no longer afford to sell, suggesting material weakness in its own business and any and all coding startups. It is also remarkable — and a shocking failure of journalism — that this isn’t in every single article about Anysphere. I'm serious! Perplexity? Perplexity only has $150 million in annualized revenue! It spent 167% of its revenue in 2024 ($57m, its revenue was $34m) on compute services from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon! It lost $68 million! And worse still, it has no path to profitability, and it’s not even anything new! It’s a search engine! Professional gasbag Alex Heath just did a flummoxing interview with Perplexity CEO Aravind Srivinas, who, when asked how it’d become profitable, appeared to experience a stroke: Aravind, do you smell toast? And don’t talk to me about “AI browsers,” I’m sorry, it’s not a business model. How are people going to make revenue on this, hm? What do these products actually do? Oh they can poorly automate accepting LinkedIn invites? It’s like God himself has personally blessed my computer. Big deal! In any case, it doesn't seem like you can really build a consumer AI startup that makes anything approaching a real company. Other than ChatGPT, I guess? Arguably the biggest sign that things are troubling in the generative AI space is that we use "annualized revenue" at all, which, as I've mentioned repeatedly, means multiplying a month by 12 and saying "that's our annualized!" The problem with this number is that, well, people cancel things. While your June might be great, if 10% of your subscribers churn in a bad month (due to a change in your terms of service), that's a chunk of your annualized revenue gone. But the worst sign is that nobody is saying the monthly figures, mostly because the monthly figures kinda suck! $100 million of annualized revenue is $8.33 million a month. To give you some scale, Amazon Web Services hit $189 million ($15.75 million a month) in revenue in 2008, two years after founding, and while it took until 2015 to hit profitability, it actually hit break-even in 2009, though it invested cash in growth for a few years after. Right now, not a single generative AI software company is profitable, and none of them are showing the signs of the kind of hypergrowth that previous "big" software companies had. While Cursor is technically "the fastest growing SaaS of all time," it did so using what amounts to fake pricing. You can dress this up as "growth stage" or "enshittification (it isn't by the way, generally price changes make things profitable, which this did not)," but Cursor lied. It lied to the public about what its product would do long-term. It isn't even obvious whether its current pricing is sustainable. Outside of Cursor, what other software startups are there? Glean? Everyone loves to talk about enterprise search company Glean — a company that uses AI to search and generate answers from your company's files and documents. In December 2024, Glean raised $260 million, proudly stating that it had over $550 million of cash in hand with "best-in-class ARR growth." A few months later in February 2025, Glean announced it’d "achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue in fourth quarter FY25, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups and reflecting a surging demand for AI-powered workplace intelligence." In this case, ARR could literally mean anything, as it appears to be based on quarters — meaning it could be an average of the last three months of the year, I guess? Anywho, in June 2025, Glean announced it had raised another funding round, this time raising $150 million, and, troublingly, added that since its last round, it had "...surpassed $100M in ARR." Five months into the fucking year and your monthly revenue is the same? That isn't good! That isn't good at all! Also, what happened to that $550 million in cash? Why did Glean need more? Hey wait a second, Glean announced its raise on June 18 2025, two days after Cursor's pricing increase and the same day that Replit announced a similar hike! It's almost as if its pricing dramatically increased due to the introduction of Anthropic's Service Tiers and OpenAI's Priority Processing. I'm guessing, but isn't it kind of weird that all of these companies raised money about the same time? Hey, that reminds me. If you look at what generative AI companies do (note that the following is not a quality barometer), it's probably doing one of the following things: Every single generative AI company that isn't OpenAI or Anthropic does one or a few of these things, and I mean every one of them, and it's because every single generative AI company uses Large Language Models, which have inherent limits on what they can do. LLMs can generate, they can search, they can edit (kind of!), they can transcribe (sometimes accurately!) and they can translate (often less accurately). As a result, it's very, very difficult for a company to build something unique. Though Cursor is successful, it is ultimately a series of system prompts, a custom model that its users hate, a user interface and connections to models by OpenAI and Anthropic, both of whom have competing products and make money from Cursor and its competitors. Within weeks of Cursor's changes to its services, Amazon and ByteDance released competitors that, for the most part, do the same thing. Sure there's a few differences in how they're designed, but design is not a moat, especially in a high-cost, negative-profit business, where your only way of growing is to offer a product you can't afford to sustain. The only other moat you can build..is the services you provide, which, when your services are dependent on a Large Language Model, are dependent on the model developer, who, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic, could simply clone your startup, because the only valuable intellectual property is theirs. You may say "well, nobody else has any ideas either," to which I'll say that I fully agree. My Rot-Com Bubble thesis suggests we're out of hypergrowth ideas, and yeah, I think we're out of ideas related to Large Language Models too. At this point, I think it's fair to ask — are there any good companies you can build on top of Large Language Models? I don't mean add features related to, I mean an AI company that actually sells a product that people buy at scale that isn't called ChatGPT. In previous tech booms, companies would make their own “models” — their own infrastructure, or the things that make them distinct from other companies — but the generative AI boom effectively changes that by making everybody build stuff on top of somebody else’s models, because training your own models is both extremely expensive and requires vast amounts of infrastructure. As a result, much of this “boom” is about a few companies — really two, if we’re honest — getting other companies to try and build functional software for them. I wanted to add one note — that, ultimately, OpenAI and Anthropic are bad for their customers. Their models are popular (by which I mean their customers' customers will expect access to them) meaning that OpenAI and Anthropic can (as they did with Cursor) arbitrarily change pricing, service availability or functionality based on how they feel that day. Don't believe me? Anthropic cut off access to AI coding platform Windsurf because it looked like it might get acquired by OpenAI. Even by big tech standards this fucking sucks. And these companies will do it again! Because all Large Language Models require more data than anyone has ever needed, they all basically have to use the same data, either taken from the internet or bought from one of a few companies (Scale, Surge, Turing, Together, etc.). While they can get customized data or do customized training/reinforcement learning, these models are all transformer-based, and they all function similarly, and the only way to make them different is by training them, which doesn't make them much different, just better at things they already do. I already mentioned OpenAI and Anthropic's costs, as well as Perplexity's $50 million+ bill to Anthropic, Amazon and OpenAI off of a measly $34 million in revenue. These companies cost too much to run, and their functionality doesn't make enough money to make them make sense. The problem isn't just the pricing, but how unpredictable it is. As Matt Ashare wrote for CIO Dive last year, generative AI makes a lot of companies’ lives difficult through the massive spikes in costs that come from power users, with few ways to mitigate their costs. One of the ways that a company manages their cloud bills is by having some degree of predictability — which is difficult to do with the constant slew of new models and demands for new products to go with them, especially when said models can (and do) cost more with subsequent iterations. As a result, it's hard for AI companies to actually budget. "But Ed!" you cry, "What about AGENTS?" Let me tell you about agents. The term "agent" is one of the most egregious acts of fraud I've seen in my entire career writing about this crap, and that includes the metaverse. When you hear the word "agent," you are meant to think of an autonomous AI that can go and do stuff without oversight, replacing somebody's job in the process, and companies have been pushing the boundaries of good taste and financial crimes in pursuit of them. Most egregious of them is Salesforce's "Agentforce," which lets you "deploy AI agents at scale" and "brings digital labor to every employee, department and business process." This is a blatant fucking lie. Agentforce is a god damn chatbot platform, it's for launching chatbots, they can sometimes plug into APIs that allow them to access other information, but they are neither autonomous nor "agents" by any reasonable definition. Not only does Salesforce not actually sell "agents," its own research shows that agents only achieve around a 58% success rate on single-step tasks, meaning, to quote The Register, "tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information." On multi-step tasks — so, you know, most tasks — they succeed a depressing 35% of the time. Last week, OpenAI announced its own "ChatGPT agent" that can allegedly go "do tasks" on a "virtual computer." In its own demo, the agent took 21 or so minutes to spit out a plan for a wedding with destinations, a vague calendar and some suit options, and then showed a pre-prepared demo of the "agent" preparing an itinerary of how to visit every major league ballpark. In this example's case, "agent" took 23 minutes, and produced arguably the most confusing-looking map I've seen in my life. It also missed out every single major league ballpark on the East Coast — including Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park — and added a random stadium in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. What team is that, eh Sam? The Deepwater Horizon Devils? Is there a baseball team in North Dakota? I should also be clear this was the pre-prepared example. As with every Large Language Model-based product — and yes, that's what this is, even if OpenAI won't talk about what model — results are extremely variable. Agents are difficult, because tasks are difficult, even if they can be completed by a human being that a CEO thinks is stupid. What OpenAI appears to be doing is using a virtual machine to run scripts that its models trigger. Regardless of how well it works (it works very very poorly and inconsistently), it's also likely very expensive. In any case, every single company you see using the word agent is trying to mislead you. Glean's "AI agents" are chatbots with if-this-then-that functions that trigger events using APIs (the connectors between different software services), not taking actual actions, because that is not what LLMs can do. ServiceNow's AI agents that allegedly "act autonomously and proactively on your behalf" are, despite claiming they "go beyond ‘better chatbots,’" still ultimately chatbots that use APIs to trigger different events using if-this-then-that functions. Sometimes these chatbots can also answer questions that people might have, or trigger an event somewhere. Oh, right, that's the same thing. The closest we have to an "agent" of any kind is a coding agent, which can make a list of things that you might do on a software project and then go and generate the code and push stuff to Github when you ask them to, and they can do so "autonomously," in the sense that you can let them just run whatever task seems right. When I say "ask them to" or "go and" I mean that these agents are not remotely intelligent, and when let run rampant fuck up everything and create a bunch of extra work. Also, a study found that AI coding tools made engineers 19% slower. Nevertheless, none of these products are autonomous agents, and anybody using the term agent likely means "chatbot." And it's working because the media keeps repeating everything these companies say. I realize we've taken kind of a scenic route here, but I needed to lay the groundwork here, because I am well and truly alarmed. According to a UBS report from the 26th of June, the public companies running AI services are making absolutely pathetic amounts of money from AI: ServiceNow's use of "$250 million ACV" — so annual contract value — may be one of the more honest explanations of revenue I've seen, putting them in the upper echelons of AI revenue unless, of course, you think for two seconds, whether these are AI-specific contracts. Or, perhaps, are they contracts including AI? Eh, who cares. It's also year-long agreements that could churn, and according to Gartner, over 40% of "agentic AI" projects will be canceled by end of 2027. And really, ya gotta laugh at Adobe and Salesforce, both of whom have talked so god damn much about generative AI and yet have only made around $100 million in annualized revenue from it. Pathetic! These aren't futuristic numbers! They're barely product categories! And none of this seems to include costs. Oh well. I haven't really spent time on my favourite subject — OpenAI being a systemic risk to the tech industry. To recap: Anthropic is in a similar, but slightly better position — it is set to lose $3 billion this year on $4 billion of revenue. It also has no path to profitability, recently jacked up prices on Cursor, its largest customer, and had to put restraints on Claude Code after allowing users to burn 100% to 10,000% of their revenue. These are the actions of a desperate company. Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic's revenues amount to, by my estimates, more than half of the entire revenue of the generative AI industry, including the hyperscalers. To be abundantly clear: the two companies that amount to around half of all generative artificial intelligence revenue are ONLY LOSING MONEY. I've said a lot of this before, which is why I'm not harping on about it, but the most important company in the entire AI industry needs to convert by the end of the year or it's effectively dead, and even if it does, it burns billions and billions of dollars a year and will die without continual funding. It has no path to profitability, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar or a fantasist. Worse still, outside of OpenAI...what is there, really? As I wrote earlier in the year, there is really no significant adoption of generative AI services or products. ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework. Sidebar: Google cheated by combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant to claim that it has 350 million users. Don't care, sorry. This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said "AI" in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can't scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry. I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT's users, and I quote myself here: It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. ChatGPT is a very successful growth product and an absolutely horrifying business. OpenAI is a banana republic that cannot function on its own, it does not resemble Uber, Amazon Web Services, or any other business in the past other than WeWork, the other company that SoftBank spent way too much money on. And outside of ChatGPT, there really isn't anything else. Before I wrap up — I'm tired, and I imagine you are too — I want to address something. Yes, generative AI has functionality. There are coding products and search products that people like and pay for. As I have discussed above, none of these companies are profitable, and until one of them is profitable, generative AI-based companies are not real businesses. In any case, the problem isn't so much that LLMs "don't do anything," but that people talk about them doing things they can't do. I believe that the generative AI market is a $50 billion revenue industry masquerading as a $1 trillion one, and the media is helping. As I've explained at length, the AI trade is not one based on revenue, user growth, the efficacy of tools or significance of any technological breakthrough. Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they'd be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that's the case. OpenAI is a terrible business, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it. Large Language Models are too expensive to run, and have limited abilities beyond the ones I've named previously, and because everybody is running models that all, on some level, do the same thing, it's very hard for people to build really innovative products on top of them. And, ultimately, this entire trade hinges on GPUs. CoreWeave was initially funded by NVIDIA, its IPO funded partially by NVIDIA, NVIDIA is one of its customers, and CoreWeave raises debt on the GPUs it buys from NVIDIA to build more data centers, while also using the money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA. This isn’t me being polemic or hysterical — this is quite literally what is happening, and how CoreWeave operates. If you aren’t alarmed by that, I’m not sure what to tell you. Elsewhere, Oracle is buying $40 billion in GPUs for the still-unformed Stargate data center project, and Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data center to fill with NVIDIA GPUs. OpenAI is Microsoft's largest Azure client — an insanely risky proposition on multiple levels, not simply in the fact that it’s serving the revenue at-cost but that Microsoft executives believed OpenAI would fail in the long term when they invested in 2023 — and Microsoft is NVIDIA's largest client for GPUs, meaning that any changes to Microsoft's future interest in OpenAI, such as reducing its data center expansion, would eventually hit NVIDIA's revenue. Why do you think DeepSeek shocked the market? It wasn't because of any clunky story around training techniques. It was because it said to the market that NVIDIA might not sell more GPUs every single quarter in perpetuity. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla aren't making much money from AI — in fact, they're losing billions of dollars on whatever revenues they do make from it. Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around "being an AI company," which means absolutely jack shit when you don't have the users, finances, or products to back them up. So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA's ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we're really honest, at this point only exists to do so. Generative AI products do not provide significant revenue growth, its products are not useful in the way that unlocks significant business value, and the products that have some adoption run at such a grotesque loss. I realize I've thrown a lot at you, and, for the second time this year, written the longest thing I've ever written. But I needed to write this, because I'm really worried. We're in a bubble. If you do not think we're in a bubble, you are not looking outside. Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Slok said it last week. Well, okay, what he said was much worse: We are in a bubble. Generative AI does not do the things that it's being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren't the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn't there, the users aren't there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it's impossible to tell how they'll survive. Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans. There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs. There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI. Before you ask- You do not have proof for this statement! The cost of tokens going down is not the same thing as the cost of inference goes down! Everyone saying this is saying it because a guy once said it to them! You don't have proof! I have more proof for what I am saying! While it theoretically might be, all evidence points to larger models costing more money, especially reasoning-heavy ones like Claude Opus 4. Inference is not the only thing happening, and if this is your one response, you are a big bozo and doofus and should go back to making squeaky noises when you see tech executives or hear my name. Okay, so one argument is that these companies will use ASICs — customized chips for specific operations — to reduce the amount they're spending. A few thoughts: I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times claims everybody is using AI for everything — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere. Other than the frog thing, I'm not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus. Worse still, despite NVIDIA's strength, NVIDIA is the market's weakness, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they're buying start making them a profit. And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way. If you're going to say I'm wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don't want me to be right? Is it because you think "these companies will work it out"? This isn't anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by a tech industry that's run out of ideas, built on top of one company. You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You've probably read the "My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts" blog, and if you're gonna send it to me, read the response from Nik Suresh first. If you're going to say that I "don't speak to people who actually use these products," you are categorically wrong and in denial. I am only writing with this aggressive tone because, for the best part of two years, I have been made to repeatedly explain myself in a way that no AI "optimist" is made, and I admit I resent it. I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and still, to this day, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I'm missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case. The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making "powerful AI." And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology. I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot. I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not outright lie about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets and the media for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of "agents" that will never exist. Everything I’m discussing is the result of the Rot Economy thesis I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, both. Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically GPUs. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to do the thing that worked before — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed. I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn't believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who "don't understand AI," you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn't that good or you're not good at explaining why it's good. Perhaps it's both. If you want to know my true agenda, it's that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others. There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don't, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it's part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what's going on. To quote my editor Matt Hughes: "...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst." I haven't quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of Business Idiots that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of futurity, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what's happening in the tech industry. And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth. I love writing, but I don't love writing this. I think I'm right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about. If I'm wrong, I'll explain how I'm wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that's why I'm so alarmed. What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company's ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars. At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won't even be sales slowing — maybe it'll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won't be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I really, really don't know how I'm wrong. I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that so many people have lost their jobs because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there are people responsible. Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable. And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers, and I now have 67,000 and a growing premium subscriber base. I am grateful for the time you’ve given me, and really hope that I continue to help you see the tech industry for what it currently is — captured almost entirely by people that have no interest in building the future.

Jio's rising ARPU through tariff hikes, the ambitious new energy business entering execution phase, and the potential Jio IPO are key catalysts.

Title: Morgan Stanley Dismisses Rumors of Apple Acquiring AI Search Firm

Time Published: 2025-07-22T02:04:01Z

Latest news Morgan Stanley isn’t buying the hype around Apple acquiring a search-based AI firm like Perplexity. While some investors and analysts speculate that an acquisition could help Apple catch up in the AI race, Morgan Stanley sees it as the wrong move and not part of Apple’s playbook. In a note to investors, analyst Erik Woodring called the idea “misguided,” arguing that Apple has no intention of entering the search market. Instead, Apple is developing virtual assistant features using its own large language models and incorporating technology from third-party partners. Woodring added that Apple isn’t trying to compete with Google, Meta, or Amazon in the same way and won’t be delivering major AI-related updates in the September quarter. While AI progress remains gradual, Apple’s core business continues to perform. Morgan Stanley has raised its revenue forecast for Apple’s fiscal Q3 2025 to $90.7 billion, a 5.8% year-over-year increase. Stronger-than-expected iPhone shipments, higher average selling prices, and steady demand for iPads and Macs are driving the growth. In the note, the firm acknowledged investor concerns over the App Store injunction and Apple’s silence on Services guidance in the previous earnings call. But Morgan Stanley isn’t worried. It projects Services revenue will grow 11.6% year-over-year, and expects the App Store alone to match that figure. The analysts believe this will mark the eighth consecutive quarter of Services growth between 10% and 15%. AppleInsider, citing Morgan Stanley’s investor note, echoed the positive sentiment around the upcoming Q3 results. Favorable exchange rates and consistent consumer demand are boosting gains across product categories, according to the firm. It now estimates iPhone performance to exceed consensus by 2%, with iPads and Macs expected to beat earlier projections by 9% and 1% respectively. Morgan Stanley expects growth to slow in the September quarter but still remain positive. He now forecasts $96.5 billion in revenue for that period, up from a previous estimate of $95.7 billion. It also revised earnings per share from $1.56 to $1.61, factoring in dollar tailwinds and improved performance across hardware and Services. Gross margins are forecasted at 46.1%, absorbing $1.5 billion in tariff costs. Despite limited AI updates expected this year, Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Apple’s long-term position in the AI space. The firm does not expect Apple Intelligence to move forward in any meaningful way until after 2026 and sees no near-term progress in China either. Apple won’t be buying its way into the AI search game. Instead, it’s playing the long game with assistant-style features built on its own tech stack. Morgan Stanley still believes in that approach and has maintained its Overweight rating on Apple stock, with a price target of $235 above recent targets from both JPMorgan and HSBC.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments.

Title: Microsoft abruptly stops selling and renting movies and TV shows on Xbox and Windows devices

But existing customers will still be able to access their purchased content As of July 18, Microsoft has stopped selling and renting TV shows and movies on both Xbox and Windows devices. An update to both the Xbox and Windows websites confirms "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content." Microsoft did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of service, but did assure customers that existing paid content will remain available for the foreseeable future. "Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ added, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality." In a FAQ that asks what other options players may have going forward, Microsoft suggests they make use of third-party entertainment apps like Amazon Prime and Apple TV. Xbox commenced its entertainment offerings in 2006, offering an initial lineup of TV shows and movies to gamers in the U.S. via Xbox Live on the one-year anniversary of its Xbox 360 console. It was the first gaming console to offer standard and high-definition TV shows and movies via digital distribution and formed part of Xbox's then lofty aspiration to be a comprehensive unified online entertainment network on its systems. Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division earlier this month, just days after multiple rumors and reports started to swirl. Over 9,000 employees are thought to have been affected.

Title: Economist Warns the AI Bubble Is Worse Than Immediately Before the Dot-Com Implosion
URL: https://futurism.com/economist-ai-bubble-worse-dot-com-implosion
Time Published: 2025-07-21T21:03:15Z
Full Content:
For years now, certain experts have warned that the AI industry is a massive bubble waiting to burst. The enormous hype driving a market frenzy, they say, could lead to a collapse if it's exposed to be built on widespread overpromising. Most recently, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok warned that the current AI bubble is starting to look even worse than the market conditions leading up to the dot-com implosion of the late 1990s. "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s," Slok wrote in a note that was widely circulated online. A chart shows the price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten performing companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. A high P/E ratio, generally speaking, indicates that a stock's price is extremely high relative to its earnings. The chart shows that the P/E ratio continues to creep higher and higher over the last five years, well above the rates we saw throughout the 1990s. In other words, the top ten companies in the S&P 500 are far more overvalued than they were in the years leading up to the dot-com crisis. Slok is ringing the alarm bells over the apparent market frenzy, driven by tech titans that are heavily invested in the AI industry. By index weighting, AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the pack in the S&P 500, followed by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet, all of which have made multibillion-dollar investments in AI. Yet earnings are still lagging far behind the astronomical spending on building out infrastructure, with some tech leaders already showing early signs of hesitancy, given the massive P/E discrepancy. Slok is far from the first to compare the current hype surrounding AI to the dot-com bubble. Even in 2023, when OpenAI's ChatGPT was only a few months old, analysts warned investors were overinvesting in unproven tech. AI critic Ed Zitron has also compared the situation to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007, which led to the collapse of the US housing market. Silicon Valley's endless appetite for AI was seriously tested earlier this year when a Chinese AI company called DeepSeek demonstrated that its AI chatbot, which cost a fraction of the computing power to train as conventional models, could trade blows with the latest large language models from the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Google, triggering a more than $1 trillion selloff at the time. How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key players in the AI race remains to be seen. Despite an explosion in popularity for tools like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, revenue still pales in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars being spent on data center expansions. According to an S&P Global research note published in June, the generative AI market is projected to grow at a breakneck pace, reaching an aggregate revenue of $85 billion by 2029. However, when you consider that's only a little more than the over $60 billion Meta will spend on capital expenditures this year alone, tech companies still have a lot of reassuring to do that their massive bet on AI will eventually pay off — and not lead to the sequel of one of the biggest stock market crashes in history.

Arm (ARM) shares climbed Monday as analysts at Wells Fargo raised their price target for the chip designer’s stock ahead of quarterly earnings due next week. The analysts raised their target to $175 from $145, well above the mean of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, which sits at about $143. Shares of Arm rose over 3% to close near $162 Monday, and have added roughly a third of their value in 2025. Arm, which develops CPU designs used in chips from companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, could be well-positioned to benefit from “expanding AI opportunities,” including growing data center demand, Wells Fargo told clients in a note Sunday. "We continue to estimate strong growth for Arm's royalties business despite tariff-related uncertainty," Wells Fargo said, adding that Arm’s ramp of AI and custom silicon designs could "drive meaningful royalty revenue growth” this fiscal year. Arm is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market closes on July 30.

Title: Unilever’s Growth Comes From Finding Opportunity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/07/21/unilevers-growth-comes-from-finding-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T16:16:05Z

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. The biggest business story of the last week has had nothing to do with tariffs, M&A, finance or earnings. It’s a relatively minor scandal. And since we’re all online, we’ve all seen it more times than we care to count: Former Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon was caught on camera at a Coldplay concert canoodling with the company’s Chief People Officer Kristen Cabot. On Friday, both Bryon and Cabot were placed on leave pending an investigation from the company’s board. On Saturday, Bryon resigned. “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said on X. Chief Product Officer and cofounder Pete DeJoy is taking over as interim CEO while Bryon’s replacement is sought. Astronomer’s company name has been dragged through the mud, though the vast majority of people sharing the image of Bryon and Cabot probably could not even describe what the company does. Astronomer is a company that uses Apache Airflow to manage data operations, helping companies leverage data for AI integration, application development and unlock deeper insights. The company closed a $93 million Series D round in May, led by Bain Capital Ventures and Salesforce Ventures. The press release detailing the funding round highlights several key accomplishments over the past 12 months: 150% year-over-year recurring revenue growth, 130% net revenue retention, and a two-year path to profitability. The company was valued at more than $1 billion at the time of the funding round. Will the new exposure and speedy investigation ultimately bring Astronomer more business? Or will Bryon and Cabot’s viral moment cost the company customers? It’s doubtful on both counts. As a B2B tech company, Astronomer’s external reputation probably won’t come into play. And in a few months the general public may still be talking about the Coldplay kiss cam moment, but they most likely won’t be talking about Astronomer as a company. Will the viral moment make fundraising more difficult? Potentially, since company leaders are the ones who need to steward new money, and poor personal choices of former executives may reflect badly on the board members and leaders who hired them in the first place. This serves as a reminder that executives always represent their companies–even during off-hours. This viral moment might have been forgotten by now if it didn’t involve two leaders of a company. Byron and Cabot’s positions add a layer of gawking and gossip, bringing a tech company into many conversations where it never would have found itself otherwise. Even as the global economy has grown more cautious and uncertain, Unilever has been on a steady path. I spoke with Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA and CEO of its Personal Care North America division, about the company’s growth and plans for the future. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. What cautious economy? Looking at the top-line financial numbers from last week, stocks surged as many companies reported better-than-expected profits. The S&P 500 set a new record high on Thursday, as 88% of companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to blunt the majority of the impact when they come, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that there is a distressing sign coming from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards. Illustration by Samantha Lee for Forbes; Images by coffeekai/Getty Images; William Krumpelman/Getty Images; Devonyu-Getty Images; Ali Çobanoğlu-Getty Images; Joe_Potato/Getty Images; lavsketch/Getty images; Muhammad Aqib/Getty Images A common office perk is losing its tax deduction, thanks to the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, food and drinks in the office will cost companies more starting on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but it expires at the end of this year. The perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work makes them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it could be difficult for companies to choose a non-deductible employee perk. OpenAI logo at the World News Media Congress in Poland. There are many challenges to enterprise AI deployment, including how to best use it. OpenAI is reportedly getting into this space. The Information recently reported that the provider is offering enterprise-grade GPT-4o deployments staffed with its engineers at a starting price of $10 million, writes Forbes contributor Sol Rashidi. Consulting can yield higher margins of 40% to 60%, Rashidi writes. OpenAI isn’t the only AI provider rushing into consulting. Google, Meta and Anthropic are all trying to augment their tools with deployment assistance. And while it is pricey to add deployment services on top of the platform agreement and software access, some companies may find it worthwhile to guarantee a smooth integration with AI systems. OpenAI is adding more to its offerings, launching its ChatGPT Agent last week. The agent is a virtual assistant that can complete work and various simple tasks, such as creating slide decks from notes, purchasing ingredients from a recipe or submitting expense reports. It will be available on enterprise plans in coming weeks, the company said. Unilever USA President and CEO of Personal Care North America Herrish Patel. Herrish Patel has worked for Unilever, one of the world’s largest CPG companies, for 24 years. In nearly a quarter century, the global company specializing in beauty, personal care, home care, food products and ice cream has taken Patel and his family around the globe, giving him a multifaceted perspective on how to innovate and grow already-strong brands. He became the president of Unilever USA and the CEO of its Personal Care North America division in 2024. I spoke with him about how he’s growing brands that are already in 98% of American homes, plus how he strengthens his team at a company that is an international behemoth. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is your strategy to build the U.S. market and getting to growth? Patel: It starts with the trends that are going to shape the U.S. I’m a big believer that the role of leadership teams in your categories is to predict where a category is going to be in three years from now. I call it getting to the future faster, or take the organization to the future and then bring them back. If I look at personal care and where it will be in three to five years, there’s certain segments, like whole body deodorants. The reality is, over the last couple of years, some insurgent brands brought to life the idea that we sweat beyond the armpit, and it’s built a whole new leg to the category, to a segment that could be $500 million going forward. The second piece is serum technology. We invented bar [soap] in a way. We then went into liquids. The next frontier will be serum technology, which is starting to converge the next generation of moisturization and body wash. Again, technology led. Lastly, you see it on TikTok and social media, people are looking for mood transportation through showers through neural signaling. We’re making an adjacency move on a brand called Olly, a vitamin supplement brand full of scientific claims and a sense that is good for karma, it’s good for mood. We are obsessed about having the science and technology, the right packaging, the right communication platform. That’s the first thing that is at the heartbeat of the business, and we’re obsessed about being market makers, category builders. The second piece is you work with the biggest retailers in the U.S. to be a category leader. You act like a category leader, you show up like a category leader and you start to share how you’re going to build the category over multiple years through your marketing and science investments. We’ve shared this U.S.-for-U.S. [A recent quote said] it’s like a new Unilever that’s agile, it’s fast and it’s moving with consumer trends which move fast in the U.S. You mentioned team building. How do you do that with a company that is as large as Unilever? In Personal Care, we call it ‘Making it personal.’ Once you have your strategy and your big bets, you build a structure to be in service to the strategy. Then strategy, structure and sourcing. Sourcing is the talent. There’s also a strategic position. You’ve built a team first that is designed to deliver the strategic position of Unilever. We serve 98% of American households, so we are going to move categories forward. The second piece that I’m a big fan of, is what I call wasting time together. It means that you invest and spend time getting to know the team. Trust and unity comes when you know beyond the face: what’s important in their lives, family, friends, how they grew up. That shapes some of the behaviors you see. Thirdly, once you’ve got a structure, you waste time, you build trust. We call it objectives, key results, OKRs. I call them mountains we’re trying to climb. Behind that strategy’s three or four mountains, we constantly sit and review where we are on that mountain, what have we learned, what we want to adjust. Then we work as a team to say the next stage of that mountain looks X or Y. Yesterday, we sat for a whole day as a leadership team and did exactly that. What are we celebrating? What is the strategic progress we’re making? Is the organization running to its potential? What are some of the leadership learnings, and where do we need to inspire and move the organization forward? I call it hardware and software. 50% is hardware, is strategy. 50% is software, and making sure the team is united in that journey. Right now we are in a period of economic uncertainty, and it’s hard to forecast anything. How does that impact Unilever? We see the recession as an opportunity, [rather] than more of a threat. What we will see is a polarization where people will seek value, while some consumers will still seek premiumization. From a U.S. perspective, we’ve got a portfolio that serves brilliant value, but we’ve also got a premium portfolio. As it continues to polarize, we’ve got a portfolio—I call it how you win the recession. We consciously talk about it. How do you come out stronger from the recession? That takes leadership, it takes a point of view. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong, but it’s important to have a strong point of view. That you take the moment where there might be some economic uncertainty for maybe two or three quarters, but we come out stronger as a consequence. What advice would you give to other business executives? This is a really important time of leadership. I think it is the time to reflect on who we are, what we stand for, and make sure that we continue to serve the U.S. with the latest innovations and grow our businesses. Personally, I think this is a moment of your own values, your own leadership style, and how you continue to adjust to lead the organization through it. I think the future is really bright in the U.S., so I think the economic outlook long-term, mid-term, will be very strong. What I’m inspired by is the thousands that work for Unilever U.S. still wake up wanting to make an impact at 98% of US households. That’s my job. How do I create an environment where everyone can flourish and maximize their potential? And that's what I do every day. My reflective moment is how can I lead to create that environment, to serve all of America, and my people are inspired to do it; they believe they have an impact.

The rush to attract the global investor at all hours of the day is on. Charles Schwab (SCHW) said Monday it is adding more securities, primarily ETFs, for 24-hour trading, bringing the total to 1,100 stocks and funds that retail investors can access outside normal U.S. business hours. The online broker extended trading access to its clients for stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, as well as a range of exchange-traded funds, in February. Its rivals Robinhood (HOOD) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), have extended trading hours that go beyond both the regular session, during which volumes are highest, and the traditional premarket and after-hours sessions. “As the pace of interconnected global markets activity increases and market-moving news and events happen outside of regular U.S. market hours, 24-hour trading gives investors flexibility and access that can be critical to take advantage of potential opportunities – as well as helping to manage risk," Charles Schwab Managing Director James Kostulias said. The most-traded stocks that Charles Schwab said it has seen since launching 24-hour trading earlier this year are shares of Tesla (TSLA), AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), and Chinese EV maker NIO (NIO), the company said.

Title: Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally Apple needs – analyst

Update font size. Reset Apple might benefit from an external AI partnership, and Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ideal match, says Melius’s Ben Reitzes. Adam Clark for Barron’s: ‎ Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence are becoming critical. It needs to do something big to be a real player in that area, and a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ticket required, according to Melius Research. The company recently lost one of its top AI researchers — Ruoming Pang, who led its machine-learning foundation model team — to Meta Platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means the focus is on Apple’s potential to strike a deal with an external AI partner. Melius’s Ben Reitzes says Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally it needs. “Apple could provide xAI with the users it needs to top [ChatGPT developer] OpenAI in return for giving Apple all the benefits of owning an LLM [large language model] without the capex,” wrote Reitzes in a research note on Monday… “Tim Cook and his team are likely to be rewarded for thinking bolder to accelerate Apple’s AI push, even if they have to step out of their comfort zone.” ‎ MacDailyNews Take: If you’re going to with an external AI partner, why not choose the smartest one? We find xAI’s Grok to be more accurate and useful than Google’s Gemini, ChatGPT, and the rest. In his note, Reitzes reiterated his “Buy” rating and $240 target price on Apple stock. Also of note: We’re going to make Baby Grok @xAI, an app dedicated to kid-friendly content — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2025 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

That’s right, BOB, you’re a mental retard who is fed narratives by compromised outlets and who dutifully spits them back like the retarded pawn you are. One side makes decisions based on personality in lieu of principles/progress. Two prominent people in our current World, were successful and popular a relatively short time ago. Today, these same two are still successful, but their “popularity” has changed from favor to disfavor in-spite of progress/principle. Who thinks like this? xAI’s is too “hitler-ish” (see: last week) for apple to partner with them. also, Elon has added his own views at the system prompt level (instructing xAI to survey what he has said about a subject prior to responding) which also excludes xAI from serious consideration, despite its AI prowess. Elon can do whatever he wants with his own AI company, but it’s anathema to Apple to partner with a company whose views are aligned in lockstep with a single controversial person. I.e. it will never ever happen. Yes, I used to think Elon was the next Steve until he let politics get in the way. Let’s make allowances that he was on drugs when he did the modified Nazi salute. However, what’s his excuse for supporting the German Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. They are a pack of Neo Nazis who deny the Holocaust, are anti-semitic and are just a pack of revisionist low life scum. As far I’m concerned Apple should have nothing to do with Musk.

July 21, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. GUANGZHOU, China, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today launched the HPC 3.0 high-performance computing platform, jointly developed with Lenovo (HKSE: 0992) and powered by NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest DRIVE AGX Thor chips. The new HPC 3.0 platform makes its debut in WeRide's latest-generation Robotaxi GXR — making it the world's first mass-produced Level 4 (L4) autonomous vehicle built on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. Fully automotive-grade, HPC 3.0 reduces autonomous driving suite cost by 50%, paving the way for GXR's large-scale commercial deployment. WeRide's HPC 3.0 platform, featuring a dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor configuration running the safety-certified DriveOS, is built on Lenovo's AD1 L4 autonomous driving domain controller — delivering up to 2,000 TOPS of AI compute. It is the most powerful computing platform available to support L4 autonomy. The HPC 3.0 platform, developed by WeRide and Lenovo, features dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor chips and is the most powerful computing platform for L4 autonomy Beyond core upgrades, HPC 3.0 boosts system integration, cutting mass production costs to a quarter of HPC 2.0 and reducing autonomous driving suite cost by 50%. It also consolidates key modules such as Ethernet gateway, CAN gateway, inertial navigation, and collision detection, reducing both production and maintenance expenses. This lowers HPC 3.0's total cost of ownership (TCO) by 84% over its lifecycle compared to its predecessor. HPC 3.0 is certified to AEC-Q100, ISO 26262, and IATF 16949 standards. Its redundant design architecture meets the highest ASIL-D safety level, with a failure rate below 50 FIT (failures per billion hours of operation) and a MTBF (mean time between failures) of 120,000 to 180,000 hours. Built for 10 years or 300,000 km of use, it is capable of operating in extreme temperatures from -40°C to 85°C and passes tests for heat, shock, and corrosion. HPC 3.0 is also fully compliant with global VOCs environmental standards, making it suitable for deployment across the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, and other international markets — supporting WeRide's goal of scaling its Robotaxi fleet worldwide. “Our close collaboration with Lenovo and NVIDIA represents a major breakthrough in computing power, system architecture, and cost efficiency. Integrating the HPC 3.0 platform into our Robotaxi GXR enhances vehicle reliability and responsiveness while significantly reducing deployment costs. Moving forward, we plan to extend this platform across more of our L4 autonomous vehicles — including the Robobus, and Robosweeper — bringing smart, accessible mobility to more cities and customers worldwide,” said Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide. “We're thrilled to see the successful deployment of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor on WeRide's Robotaxi GXR, marking a significant step towards bringing L4 autonomous vehicles to market at scale. Our close collaboration with WeRide on the AD1 domain controller has been instrumental in accelerating this innovation. Lenovo is committed to leveraging our advanced computing power and working with industry partners to drive the commercialization of autonomous driving solutions globally,” said Donny Tang, Vice President and Head of Lenovo Vehicle Computing, Lenovo. NVIDIA has been a strategic investor in WeRide since 2017 via the NVIDIA Inception program. Ali Kani, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA, also extended congratulations to WeRide. “Robotaxis are reshaping urban mobility, and it’s exciting to witness the progress WeRide and Lenovo have made in deploying a Level 4 autonomous driving system built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and DriveOS,” said Ali Kani, Vice President of Automotive, NVIDIA. “Their achievement marks a significant milestone in helping make safe, scalable, and efficient autonomous transportation a reality.” NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, NVIDIA's successor to DRIVE AGX Orin, is built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and is optimized for the most demanding processing workloads, including generative AI, vision language models and large language models. Its simplified architecture enhances generalization, reduces latency and boosts safety by harnessing powerful NVIDIA accelerated computing to run WeRide’s proprietary AV software stack. As the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi company, WeRide has safely operated Robotaxis on public roads for over 2,000 days. The company continues to scale its technology through global partnerships, delivering safe, efficient, and cost-efficient autonomous mobility. About WeRide WeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company. Our autonomous vehicles have been tested or operated in over 30 cities across 10 countries. We are also the first and only technology company whose products have received autonomous driving permits in five markets: China, the UAE, Singapore, France, and the US. Empowered by the smart, versatile, cost-effective, and highly adaptable WeRide One platform, WeRide provides autonomous driving products and services from L2 to L4, addressing transportation needs in the mobility, logistics, and sanitation industries.

Title: Why Has GE Vernova Stock Moved 68%?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) is experiencing significant momentum. Since it emerged as an independent energy entity in early 2024, its stock has soared nearly 68% year-to-date. This performance isn't merely strong—it far surpasses market expectations, crushing the S&P. So, what is driving this impressive surge? At its essence, GE Vernova is benefiting from a robust energy infrastructure supercycle. With the rapid expansion of AI data centers, electrification, and grid developments, there is a pressing need for infrastructure—and Vernova’s gas turbines, grid technology, and renewable energy solutions are central to this growth. The firm has reported a significant increase in turbine orders, and its backlog has now surpassed $120 billion. This demand is not just busy—it signifies a booked-out-for-years scenario. With the AI boom also playing a role, it becomes clear why major investors are investing heavily. Although GEV stock has shown volatility, if you're looking for potential rewards with less fluctuation than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its launch. When GE separated into distinct companies, Vernova was perceived as the more industrial, slower-growing counterpart. However, that perception has quickly changed. The company has strengthened its balance sheet, enhanced profit margins, and demonstrated impressive execution under its new leadership. All attention is focused on the Q2 earnings report (scheduled for July 23), with expectations soaring. If Vernova continues to exceed projections and demonstrate solid profitability, the upward trend could persist. The AI energy boom shows no signs of fading—and Vernova’s turbines are right at the heart of the action. High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why does this happen? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Best International Equity ETFs of 2025

With European markets consistently outperforming their US counterparts, investors are eyeing funds tracking foreign companies. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs are booming in the US, but that doesn’t mean investors are keeping their investments stateside. International equity ETFs that invest in publicly traded companies have surged this year, posting returns of 20% or more and cementing international funds at the top of the heap of the best performing funds of 2025’s first half. The massive gains were due to overperforming European markets and strong performing sectors in other countries. The outperformance in Europe, relative to both the US and international stocks more broadly, can be attributed to an “increased willingness” for those countries to invest in companies that help drive economic growth, said Zachary Evens, a Morningstar research analyst. “Banks and utilities and industrials and communication service companies, like telecoms, these companies are more boring,” he said. “They don’t typically grow very fast, but they benefit from broad economic growth, so a lot of the outperformance has been concentrated in some of those stocks.” European stocks have outperformed their US counterparts for the past three years, reversing a trend of US dominance that began following the Great Recession, with the MSCI EMU Index outpacing the S&P 500 by more than 35 percentage points since 2022, according to Schwab. International stocks in general have also beaten American stocks, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index. Some of the top-performing international markets ETFs so far this year are: Still, diversification is key to avoiding region-specific downturns. “If Spain grows by a lot, but France falters, then diversification will even that out… That also goes for the sector side,” said Evens. “You would be better suited to be more diversified across sectors and countries to minimize those negative impacts.” All Hail the Sector. Sector performance tends to be the main driver of stock performance, with US markets leaning heavily on tech companies in recent years. Still, outside factors — inflation, political deals, tariffs — have an impact on sectors, which in turn affects markets, according to Evens. “What impacts the performance of those sectors would be more idiosyncratic risks or geopolitical factors, or economic factors,” he said. “Weighing those is how investors can think about potential outperformance or underperformance of the respective markets.” An ETF from Roundhill Investments trades out of S&P 500 ETFs before dividends are paid, thus avoiding the tax implications. It may be only a matter of time before the Securities and Exchange Commission lets crypto ETFs redeem their digital assets in kind. The business Michael Venuto started over a decade ago has become one of the go-to places for small firms looking to launch ETFs. The asset manager has asked the SEC to make QQQ an open-end fund, which would benefit Invesco and its shareholders. The company’s latest spin on protected Bitcoin investing includes Calamos ETFs that diversify their exposure to a range of Bitcoin funds. The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday.

Title: Trump sharpens the axe for the Education Department. Swing away, Mr. President. | Opinion

Full Content:
The largest employer in the United States isn't a Fortune 100 company like Alphabet, Amazon or Apple. It's the federal government − and that's a problem. Thankfully, President Donald Trump continues to slash bureaucratic bloat. On July 11, the administration sent layoff notices to more than 1,300 State Department workers, and three days later, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with plans to gut the Department of Education. That's bad news for government employees, but great for taxpayers, especially given the Education Department's expense − $268 billion in the last fiscal year − and its lack of effectiveness. Despite the department's massive budget, students in the U.S. far too often lag behind peers in other industrialized countries. In 2022, for example, American 15-year-olds scored behind peers from 25 other countries on an international math test. And we're losing ground. Math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress continue to decline. Part of the drop can be attributed to pandemic-related learning loss, but reading scores in the U.S. began to decline in 2019 − before Americans had even heard of COVID-19. But how will pulling the federal government out of K-12 education help? It's important to note that more than 90% of public school funding comes from state and local governments along with foundations and other private sources. Much of the federal education budget is used to feed the bureaucracy, which generates rules and regulations that local administrators and teachers must obey. If all of that bureaucratic oversight consistently produced better results, there might be a case for keeping it. But the data clearly shows it doesn't. Removing federal bureaucrats from our schools should give states and local school districts more flexibility to set education policy, and that should improve choices for parents like me. Returning more control to the states also should improve efficiency and enable schools to better meet students' needs. Trump isn't cutting jobs only at the Education Department, of course. The State Department layoffs follow reductions at other federal agencies this spring. The cuts are driven by necessity: Our national debt is now more than $37 trillion, and the annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion again in 2025. So, I was surprised to see news reports paint the laid off State Department workers as heroic. Cameras caught teary goodbyes and applause for well-liked employees. I don't recall the same concern when President Joe Biden halted construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which cost 1,500 workers their jobs and eliminated plans to create thousands more. While job loss is certainly scary, and I don't wish it on anyone, federal job cuts should be put in the context of the overall jobs market. Microsoft has announced that it would eliminate 9,000 jobs, not because the company is failing but because it's retooling as the market changes. Other companies, including Intel and Meta, have announced plans to restructure this year as the emergence of artificial intelligence and other technology changes how Americans work. The federal government should be as flexible as our top companies in adapting to a changing world. Yet, progressives have criticized the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy as cruel. The president's job, however, isn't to employ as many bureaucrats as possible. It's to deliver effective services as efficiently as possible to taxpayers. Dismantling ineffective and inefficient bureaucracies like the Education Department is a long overdue step toward achieving that goal.

Today, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with the Nifty 50 closing at around 25,092, up approximately 0.5% from the previous close. The key driver behind this upbeat session was the strong quarterly earnings reports from major private sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, whose shares rose around +2.2% following their better-than-expected profits. This buoyed the financial sector, which was the lone major sector with a notable gain of about 1.2%, offsetting losses seen in other sectors.

Equirus Capital * RELIANCE posted a resilient 1QFY26 EBITDA of Rs 429bn (+11% yoy, -2% qoq), slightly below EE, with strong growth in R-Jio (+7% qoq EBITDA) and retail (+11% yoy). O2C was steady qoq but missed EE, while upstream remained soft. PAT surged to Rs 307bn (+37% qoq) aided by Rs 89bn gains on Asian Paints stake and higher interest income. * R-Jio continued to anchor growth with rising ARPU, robust net adds, and digital scale-up (broadband, FWA). We model a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E. Retail stayed in recovery with 8-quarter high store adds and margins steady at 7.2%. We expect a 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR as restructuring eases and SSSg normalises. * O2C margins should gradually improve, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27, with easing feedstock pressures and better spreads amid record-low inventories. * Retail scale-up visibility, O2C margin bottoming, and commissioning of New Energy assets support our FY25-FY27E EBITDA CAGR of 19%. Retain ADD with a Sep’26 TP of Rs 1,546. Near-term triggers: Tariff hikes, retail recovery, value unlocking in R-Jio. Jio Platforms – growth visibility strong: R-Jio reported a solid 1Q with 7% qoq/24% yoy EBITDA growth and margins improving to ~52%. Growth was supported by rising ARPU (Rs 209, +15% yoy), strong net adds (10mn), and leadership across wireless (~51% market share), FWA, and broadband. Jio AirFiber subscribers crossed 7.4mn, making it the largest FWA platform globally. As per TRAI (May’25), Bharti Airtel (31% market share) and Vodafone (13%) had 302mn and 127mn subscribers, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, led by rising fixed broadband penetration, modest tariff hikes, and continued subscriber additions. Retail – recovery in motion : Reliance Retail delivered 11% yoy EBITDA growth, aided by continued store expansion (+252 qoq to 19,592). Margins were stable yoy at 7.2% (down 20bps qoq). Digital commerce scaled up strongly – JioMart daily order volumes jumped 175% yoy, and AJIO Rush sustained its early momentum. We expect 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, as store restructuring and SSSg normalise. O2C – margin normalisation to drive modest upside: Despite throughput pressure from planned M&I, EBITDA grew 11% yoy to Rs 145bn, with stable qoq EBITDA/mt at US$ 98. However, higher feedstock and freight costs weighed on qoq profitability. We expect margins to improve steadily, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27. New Energy – execution phase begins: The business is entering a critical execution phase, with large-scale investments underway across solar PV, storage, green hydrogen, and supply chain. Giga-factory commissioning is expected over the next 4-6 quarters. We value the New Energy vertical at 1.5x invested capital, implying a value of ~Rs.1.2tn (5% of total value).

He was joined on the dais by Sanjay Nayar, President Assocham and Sajjan Jindal, Past President Assocham and Chairman JSW Group. Mr. Goyal also said that the EFTA-India FTA agreement will take effect on October 1, 2025. He urged ASSOCHAM members present at the meeting to focus on scale and quality to remain competitive and take advantage of these FTAs. He also highlighted the need to focus on innovation to stay competitive. The event saw the participation of leading CEOs from Indian Industry including Mr. B K Goenka, Chairman Welspun World, Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, Founder & Chairman, Hiranandani Group, Mr. Vineet Aggarwal, Managing Director, Transport Corporation of India Ltd., Mr. M K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Sanghi Group, Mr. Sunil Kanoria, Trustee, Kanoria Foundation, Ms Falguni Nayar, CEO of Nykaa, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta, Executive Chairman, El Carterton India, Mr. Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman, RPG Group and Mr. Gunit Chadha, Founder and MD, APAC Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. among others. Speaking at the event, the minister said the FDI commitment would also create a million direct jobs in the coming years, and help technology and innovation through Swiss SMEs entering Indian markets “My calculation, or my gut sense is that $100 billion FDI, along with Indian promoter equity, when they come into your companies, it will catalyse to at least $500 billion investment in India into brownfield or greenfield,” said the minister. Citing a game-changing initiative, Mr. Goyal said that the cabinet has sanctioned ₹1 lakh crore towards an innovation fund to drive R&D in the country. “When I tell you that a 1 lakh crore rupees, which is about $12 billion, invest it, it’ll multiply through many rotations. It can be given out to all of you or any company willing to do it in, research and development in the form of a grant, in the form of low-cost loan, interest-free loan, long term loan,” said Mr. Goyal. Recognizing the pivotal role of MSMEs, Mr. Goyal stressed the need for enabling these enterprises with access to global markets, modern technology, and affordable capital. With 2.4 million STEM graduates annually, including 43% women, India is well-positioned to scale up its manufacturing and innovation capabilities. Recognising India’s potential as a global capability hub, he said the country can emerge as a high-quality destination for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), as India now offers, comparable or superior talent at a fifth of global costs, lower-than-expected real estate and energy costs, and a compelling alternative to offshore operations, amid declining H1B dependency. On the social security pact with the UK, Goyal said India has successfully negotiated a social security agreement with the UK, enabling Indian professionals on short-term UK work visas (up to 3 years) to contribute Indian EPF accounts rather than losing 25% of their overseas earnings in UK social security contributions. When asked by a delegate on the government’s Bharat Mart initiative, the union minister highlighted plans to replicate a similar model for Indian MSMEs, particularly leveraging Mumbai’s strategic and financial advantage, with government support and incentives promised. On the upcoming EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which mandates supply chain traceability for seven commodities (like coffee, wood, furniture, etc.), requiring detailed farmer and production data to be uploaded, the minister acknowledged this regulation as a non-tariff barrier. He urged Indian industries to proactively engage and negotiate such barriers and emphasised that quality compliance, not just quantity, must be a national priority.

(3) India’s export sector is facing a slowdown: – FY23: Double-digit rise – In FY25, growth is just 6% Global demand is down, and India is feeling the pinch. Companies with export businesses are slowing down.

Full Content:
The photographer who believes their education ended with their last workshop or tutorial is already obsolete. They just don't know it yet. In an industry where technological shifts can render entire skill sets worthless within months and where client expectations evolve faster than most professionals can adapt, the notion of "learning photography" as a one-time achievement has become not just naive, but a good way to kill your career. This harsh reality contradicts the romantic ideal many photographers hold about their craft. We often envision photography as a timeless art form where mastering composition, light, and storytelling creates a foundation of enduring value. While these fundamentals remain important, they represent merely the entry fee to professional relevance. The photographers thriving today are those who have embraced learning as their primary professional skill—not their secondary consideration. The accelerating pace of change in professional photography has created what amounts to a learning arms race. Those who fail to participate don't gradually fall behind; they experience sudden, catastrophic obsolescence. The wedding photographer who dismisses drone footage as a fad discovers many clients now expect aerial shots. The portrait photographer who considers smartphone cameras inferior watches as clients use phones for headshots. The commercial photographer who views AI as a distant threat finds their retouching workflows automated away by algorithms. This article examines why continuous learning has evolved from professional advantage to survival necessity and provides frameworks for building sustainable learning systems that can keep pace with industry evolution. Consider the transformation of low-light photography over the past decade. Professional cameras that produced unusable noise at ISO 3200 in 2014 now deliver clean images at ISO 25,600 and beyond. This advancement didn't simply improve image quality—it eliminated entire lighting setups, changed location requirements, and redefined client expectations for available-light photography. Autofocus systems have undergone similarly disruptive evolution. Eye-detection autofocus has transformed portrait and wedding photography by eliminating major technical barriers. The wedding photographer who built their reputation on consistently sharp focus during challenging ceremonies now competes with photographers who achieve the same results through computational assistance. Video capabilities represent perhaps the most dramatic technological disruption. Professional photographers who dismissed video as "not their domain" discovered that hybrid shooting became the industry standard almost overnight. Clients began expecting photographers to deliver both stills and motion content from single shoots, fundamentally altering project scope and pricing structures. The mirrorless revolution exemplifies how technological change creates cascading learning requirements. Beyond the obvious operational differences, mirrorless systems introduced entirely new capabilities like silent shooting modes, in-body image stabilization, and computational photography features. Photographers who delayed transitioning to mirrorless systems didn't just miss incremental improvements; they fell behind on features that became client expectations. Photography software development has accelerated to a pace that challenges even dedicated professionals' ability to maintain current knowledge. Adobe's transition to subscription-based Creative Cloud enabled rapid feature rollouts that arrive monthly rather than annually, creating a continuous learning requirement just to utilize existing tools effectively. Lightroom's AI-powered masking tools exemplify this challenge. The selection methods that photographers spent years mastering—careful brush work, precise luminosity masks, complex channel operations—became obsolete within single software updates. The photographer who built efficiency through manual masking techniques suddenly found AI selections completing the same work in seconds. Color grading has experienced similar disruption. Traditional color correction workflows based on curves and split-toning gave way to professional color grading tools that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer familiar with basic color adjustment now needs to understand color wheels and LUT applications to meet contemporary post-processing expectations. Digital delivery has evolved beyond simple JPEG files to encompass formats and platforms that require specialized knowledge. High-resolution displays demand understanding of color space management, viewing environment considerations, and output optimization techniques that didn't exist in the film era. Social media platforms have created format-specific requirements that change constantly. Facebook's algorithm preferences, Instagram's image display specifications, and TikTok's vertical video requirements each demand platform-specific optimization knowledge. The photographer who masters one platform's requirements faces immediate obsolescence when algorithm changes or new platforms emerge. Print delivery has simultaneously become more complex and more specialized. Wide-gamut displays, HDR monitors, and high-end printing technologies require color management expertise that extends far beyond basic calibration. The photographer who learned to "trust their monitor" now needs understanding of ICC profiles, soft proofing, gamut mapping, and more to deliver consistent results. Virtual and augmented reality applications represent emerging delivery formats that will likely become standard within the next decade, and their capture techniques require entirely new skill sets that combine traditional photography knowledge with 3D modeling and spatial computing concepts. Modern photography clients arrive with visual sophistication developed through constant exposure to professional imagery across digital platforms. This exposure has created expectations that extend far beyond simple technical competency to encompass aesthetic trends, storytelling approaches, and production values that evolve rapidly. Corporate clients now expect photographers to understand brand positioning, target demographic analysis, and marketing campaign integration. The commercial photographer who once focused purely on creating compelling images now needs fluency in brand strategy, customer journey mapping, and conversion optimization principles. Clients assume photographers understand how images function within broader marketing ecosystems, not as isolated creative deliverables. Real estate photography has transformed from simple room documentation to lifestyle marketing that requires understanding of target buyer psychology, staging principles, and virtual tour technologies. The photographer who learned to capture accurate room representations now needs skills in HDR processing, virtual staging, drone operations, and 3D modeling to meet market expectations. Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how clients discover, evaluate, and engage with photographers. This shift extends beyond marketing to influence aesthetic preferences, project scope, and delivery expectations in ways that require ongoing adaptation. The Instagram aesthetic has created demand for highly stylized, immediately recognizable imagery that favors dramatic processing over natural representation. Photographers who built careers on subtle, sophisticated work now compete with heavily stylized content that performs better on social platforms, regardless of technical or artistic merit. TikTok's influence has introduced motion-based thinking to traditionally still-image clients. Wedding clients request "TikTok moments," corporate clients want "behind-the-scenes content," and portrait clients expect "process videos" that document their photo sessions. These requests require video production skills, storytelling techniques, and platform-specific content creation knowledge. Real-time sharing expectations have compressed delivery timelines to hours rather than days or weeks. Clients expect preview images during shoots, same-day sneak peeks, and rapid turnaround on final deliverables that require streamlined workflows and efficient processing systems. The digital marketplace has created competing pressures for both faster delivery and higher quality that challenge traditional photography business models. Clients simultaneously demand immediate access to preview content and increasingly sophisticated final deliverables. Event photography now often operates under expectations for real-time gallery updates, social media sneak peeks, and next-day full gallery delivery. The event photographer who once had weeks to carefully process and deliver images now needs workflows that enable rapid processing without sacrificing quality standards. E-commerce photography faces particular pressure for volume and speed. Online retailers need hundreds of product images processed and delivered within tight timelines while maintaining pixel-perfect consistency across product lines. This demand requires automation skills, batch processing expertise, and quality control systems that ensure consistency at scale. Content marketing has created demand for regular, ongoing photography services rather than project-based work. Brands need fresh visual content weekly or daily, requiring photographers to develop sustainable production systems that can deliver consistent quality over extended periods. The photography industry has experienced significant consolidation that concentrates market power among fewer, larger players while simultaneously lowering barriers to entry for individual practitioners. This paradox creates complex competitive dynamics that require strategic adaptation. The photographer who once relied on stock licensing for steady income now competes with AI-generated imagery and subscription-based stock services that offer unlimited downloads at prices that undercut traditional licensing models. Wedding photography has seen the emergence of large-scale companies that standardize services, pricing, and delivery while promising consistent quality across multiple markets. These companies compete with individual photographers by offering reduced client risk, standardized packages, and corporate reliability that appeals to certain client segments. Professional photography now faces competition from sources that didn't exist a decade ago, requiring traditional photographers to differentiate their services in increasingly sophisticated ways. Smartphone photography has reached quality levels that satisfy many clients' basic documentation needs. Corporate headshots, social media content, and casual event photography can now be executed with phone cameras and basic editing apps, eliminating the technical barriers that once protected professional photographers from amateur competition. AI-generated imagery represents an emerging threat that will likely eliminate certain types of commercial photography entirely. Stock photography, basic product visualization, and conceptual illustration work can now be created algorithmically at costs and speeds that traditional photography cannot match. Content creators and influencers have developed photography skills that enable them to produce professional-quality imagery for their own needs, reducing demand for traditional commercial photography services while creating new opportunities for education and collaborative work. Market expansion and increased competition have created downward pricing pressures that force photographers to improve efficiency, expand service offerings, or accept reduced margins to maintain profitability. Global competition through remote work capabilities has exposed local photography markets to international pricing pressure. Clients can now access high-quality editing services, virtual assistance, and specialized skills from global talent pools that often undercut local pricing. Professional photography has a brutal history of rendering specialized skills completely worthless through technological advancement. Understanding which skills face obsolescence risk helps photographers prioritize learning investments more effectively. Film processing expertise represents the most obvious example of skill obsolescence. Photographers who spent decades mastering darkroom techniques found their specialized knowledge had no digital equivalent. Manual focusing skills became largely obsolete with advanced autofocus systems. Traditional color correction techniques using physical filters and film stocks have been replaced by digital color grading workflows that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer who mastered tungsten-balanced film with color correction filters needs completely different skills for digital color grading. Large format technical camera operations have become niche requirements as digital cameras achieve resolution and image quality that previously required view cameras. The commercial photographer who specializes in architectural photography using large format systems now needs digital capture skills for most projects. Professional knowledge in photography decays at different rates depending on its technological dependence and market relevance. Understanding these decay rates helps prioritize learning investments and skill maintenance efforts. Software-specific knowledge has the fastest decay rate, often becoming obsolete within months of major updates. Photoshop techniques, Lightroom workflows, and specialized software skills require constant updating to maintain relevance. Equipment-specific knowledge decays as manufacturers discontinue products and introduce new systems. The photographer who becomes expert with specific camera systems faces knowledge obsolescence when those systems become discontinued or superseded by fundamentally different technologies. Industry standard practices decay more slowly but still require regular updates. File delivery formats, color space standards, and workflow conventions evolve over years rather than months, but still require periodic learning updates to maintain professional relevance. Aesthetic trends and style preferences decay at variable rates depending on market segments. Wedding photography styles might remain popular for several years, while social media aesthetics can become outdated within months. The competitive disadvantage of obsolete skills extends beyond simple irrelevance to create active detriments in client relationships and market positioning. Photographers using outdated techniques often deliver results that clients perceive as inferior, even when technically proficient. The portrait photographer using traditional lighting setups might produce excellent images that clients reject because they don't match contemporary aesthetic preferences. Inefficient workflows create cost disadvantages that compound over time. The photographer who manually performs tasks that could be automated spends more time on each project, reducing profitability and limiting capacity for additional work. Outdated delivery methods can eliminate photographers from consideration entirely. Clients who expect online galleries, digital downloads, and mobile-optimized viewing won't work with photographers using traditional print-based delivery systems, regardless of image quality. Communication barriers emerge when photographers can't discuss contemporary techniques, trends, or technologies with clients who have educated themselves through online resources and social media exposure. Professional photographers can choose between anticipatory learning that prepares for future changes and reactive learning that responds to current market demands. Each approach offers distinct advantages and risks that require strategic consideration. Anticipatory learning involves identifying emerging technologies, market trends, and client expectations before they become mainstream requirements. This approach enables photographers to establish competitive advantages by mastering new capabilities before competitors recognize their importance. Virtual reality photography represents an anticipatory learning opportunity. While VR applications remain relatively niche, photographers who develop 360-degree capture skills, spatial audio recording capabilities, and VR content creation workflows position themselves for possible future market expansion in immersive media. Drone photography exemplified successful anticipatory learning for photographers who recognized the potential before client demand matured. Early adopters who obtained licenses and developed aerial photography skills captured market opportunities as demand expanded. AI integration in photography workflows presents current anticipatory learning opportunities. Photographers who understand automated processing capabilities and AI-assisted editing tools will likely have competitive advantages as these technologies mature. Reactive learning responds to established market demands and proven client requirements. This approach reduces investment risk by focusing on validated market needs but sacrifices first-mover advantages and may result in commoditized competition. Social media content creation became a reactive learning necessity for most photographers after client demand was established. Photographers who delayed developing Instagram skills, TikTok content creation, and platform-specific optimization knowledge found themselves excluded from client opportunities. Video capabilities represent reactive learning for photographers who initially focused exclusively on still imagery. As hybrid shooting became the standard expectation, photographers needed to develop video skills to maintain competitive relevance. Professional learning requires significant investments of time and money that must be allocated strategically to maximize return on investment while maintaining current business operations. The 70-20-10 learning allocation model provides a framework for balancing current skill maintenance, incremental improvement, and experimental learning. Seventy percent of learning time focuses on refining current capabilities, twenty percent develops adjacent skills that complement existing expertise, and ten percent explores emerging technologies or completely new domains. Financial learning budgets should account for both direct costs, like courses and equipment, and indirect costs, including lost income during learning periods and opportunity costs of time allocation. Many photographers underestimate the total investment required for meaningful skill development. Time allocation strategies must balance intensive learning periods with gradual skill development. Some skills benefit from concentrated learning efforts that enable rapid competency development, while others require extended practice and gradual improvement over months or years. Sustainable learning requires systematic approaches that integrate continuous skill development into regular business operations rather than treating learning as separate from professional practice. Curated sources and expert recommendations enable efficient identification of valuable learning resources while avoiding information overload. Practice scheduling ensures regular application of new skills in low-risk environments before deploying them in client work. Personal projects, volunteer opportunities, and experimental shoots provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Modern photography careers require diversification strategies that reduce dependence on any single skill set, client type, or market segment while enabling strategic responses to industry changes. Consider developing complementary capabilities that appeal to existing clients while opening new market opportunities. The wedding photographer who adds engagement sessions, family portraits, and branding photography creates multiple revenue streams that share similar skill requirements. Skill stacking involves combining photography expertise with complementary capabilities that create unique value propositions and competitive differentiation. Marketing and business development skills enable photographers to control their own client acquisition and brand development rather than depending on referrals or third-party marketing services. Understanding SEO, social media marketing, and client relationship management provides sustainable competitive advantages. Technology integration skills can help photographers leverage automation, AI tools, and workflow optimization to improve efficiency and quality while reducing operational costs. These capabilities become increasingly valuable as technology continues to advance. Creative direction and project management skills enable photographers to take on larger, more complex projects that command higher rates and provide greater client value. The photographer who can manage entire creative campaigns rather than just executing individual shoots has expanded market opportunities. Professional learning competes with income-generating activities for photographers' limited time, requiring strategic allocation decisions that balance immediate revenue needs with long-term career development. Daily learning habits integrate skill development into regular routines without requiring major schedule disruptions. Fifteen to thirty minutes of focused learning each day accumulates significant knowledge over time while remaining manageable within busy schedules. Weekly or monthly learning blocks provide concentrated time for more intensive skill development that requires sustained focus. Three to four hour learning sessions enable meaningful progress on complex topics like new software mastery or technical skill development. Seasonal learning intensives take advantage of slower business periods to pursue major skill development projects. Wedding photographers might use winter months for extensive education, while commercial photographers might leverage holiday periods for learning investments. These concentrated learning periods require careful financial planning but can accelerate career development dramatically. Learning investments require both direct financial outlays and opportunity cost considerations that must be planned and budgeted like other business expenses. Equipment learning costs include not only purchase prices but also the time required to master new tools effectively. Camera system changes might require lens replacements, software updates, and extensive practice time that collectively represent substantial investments. Education expenses encompass formal courses, workshops, and online training that provide structured learning experiences. These costs should be evaluated based on learning outcomes and career impact rather than simple expense minimization. Experimental project budgets enable risk-free learning through personal work that doesn't depend on client satisfaction or immediate revenue generation. These projects provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Lost opportunity costs during learning periods must be factored into learning investment calculations. Time spent learning represents income not earned from client work, making learning investments more expensive than direct costs alone. Learning investments should be evaluated using measurable outcomes that justify the time and money invested while guiding future learning decisions. Client acquisition improvements provide clear ROI measurements when new skills enable access to higher-paying clients or previously unavailable market segments. The commercial photographer who learns 3D rendering might command significantly higher rates for product visualization work. Efficiency improvements can be measured through reduced time requirements for similar work, enabling higher hourly rates or increased project capacity. Workflow automation skills that reduce editing time directly impact profitability. Rate increases enabled by new capabilities provide straightforward ROI calculations. The portrait photographer who develops high-end retouching skills might justify 50% rate increases that quickly recover learning investments. Market positioning improvements create long-term value that might be difficult to measure immediately but provide sustainable competitive advantages. Brand development through specialized skills creates client loyalty and referral opportunities that compound over time. The photographer who views learning as optional has fundamentally misunderstood the nature of modern professional practice. In an industry where technological change accelerates annually and client expectations evolve continuously, learning has become one of the primary professional skills that determines career success or failure. This reality challenges traditional notions of photographic mastery that emphasize one-time skill acquisition and artistic development. While creative vision and technical fundamentals remain important, they now serve as entry-level requirements rather than career-defining capabilities. The photographers who thrive in contemporary markets are those who have mastered the meta-skill of continuous adaptation. The choice facing every professional photographer is not whether to embrace continuous learning, but how to implement learning systems that enable sustainable adaptation to accelerating change. The photographers who develop these systems now will dominate markets in the coming decade. Those who delay will find themselves competing not for premium opportunities, but for survival in an industry that shows no mercy to the unprepared. The future belongs to photographers who have learned how to learn. Alex Cooke is a Cleveland-based photographer and meteorologist. He teaches music and enjoys time with horses and his rescue dogs. Thanks for another excellently thought out and written article! I agree wholeheartedly with what you have written here. I myself dislike learning how to use technology, so I just don't even try. And that has most certainly caused me to be left behind inasmuch as earning potential goes. When I look at all of the job postings on LinkedIn for photographers, I see that all of these things are required - familiarity with sundry software applications, the ability to use remotely triggered cameras, artificial lighting, drones, etc., etc., etc. It fries my brain just thinking about all of that stuff. There is honestly no way I could ever get any of those photographer jobs, even though I have been a prolific photographer for 18 years. Why? Because I am not willing to learn how to use technology. I am eager to learn more and more and more about my subjects - I mean I will often spend 4 to 6 hours online researching a new-to-me animal species that I want to find and photograph. Or I will spend days and days researching where to find certain species throughout remote areas of the US. This kind of learning fascinates me and I can not get enough of it! But nobody hiring photographers cares at all about those things. They only want people who are learning about technical things - gear and software. And if you aren't really up to speed with those things then you are NOT going to get a job as a photographer in a fast-paced office environment at a publisher or advertising agency or public relations firm. Tom, your passion for researching wildlife and locations is exactly the kind of specialized knowledge that creates lasting value! Subject matter expertise is incredibly valuable. Photographers like you who deeply understand their subjects often create the most compelling work. Your skills ARE a competitive advantage, even if they're not what's listed in job postings. That's a very frustrating thing to deal with. Wow, Alex ... thanks so much for thinking that what I do is valuable. It is the #1 passion in my life so your kind words mean a lot. Its easier to measure know-how in photography technical skills than the depth of your knowledge. Sometimes those who hire you do not even have the specialized knowledge that you have and that is the cruel reality in today's photography landscape. Excellent article and a lot to take in. The photography landscape has certainly become a complex and demanding endeavor. Perhaps that’s why so many of us remain hobbyists, specially the older we get. But I would add that a youthful attitude and really wanting to be part of an emerging generation of creatives is necessary. You're absolutely right about the youthful attitude being key. I think the willingness to embrace change and stay curious matters more than age itself. Some of the most adaptable photographers I know are older professionals who've maintained that mindset throughout their careers. The number one skill photographers need is business related skills. Anyone can learn new technologies and master all of the technical skills but if they have no ability to actually operate a business and sell themselves, no matter how great their photography is, that is why they will fail. Too many great photographers fail because they don't know how to market themselves and run as a business. Same goes for the video market too. People can get jobs using older camera gear and many jobs don't require the latest and greatest gear, product photography is one good example. Totally agree. Business acumen is often the deciding factor between success and failure. You can have all the latest technical skills but without the ability to market yourself and manage client relationships, it's all moot. You might very well be right, Alex, in your assessment of the skill sets necessary to function in the business world of photography. But, honestly, your article was about as depressing as anything I've read lately. By the time I got to "The Learning Investment Framework" I was ready to drive a stake through my head. Seriously though, I think everyone needs to examine themselves for what they are realistically capable of achieving. Staying totally current on everything from SEO to AI seems like it would be a Herculean task. My 30 year-old self might embrace the challenge. In fact, I was doing that when the Apple Macintosh computer, Pagemaker and Photoshop first arrived on the scene. My 70 year-old self currently has had enough of all the expectations which follow the next so-called improvement. There gets to be a point where we become totally obsessed with updates, and lose sight of the reason we fell in love with photography in the first place.... and it wasn't so that I could integrate my workflow with Creative Cloud systems and my work partner on the other side of the planet. True, there are companies which demand those skills, but as an independent artist delivering no more than a photographic print to a person who bought it, I can be about as antiquated as I want to be. Not a single customer has ever asked me if I had a calibrated monitor. My thought is to know yourself and what you are capable of, what you have a passion for, and find a place that fits; otherwise we're just turning into heartless machines, riddled with anxiety, and constantly fearful of being left behind. Life should be better than that, and I believe the art of seeing a picture from out of all the noise and clutter which surrounds us will always provide the fundamental basis for a photographer's joy and success. . I love your comment, Ed! The most important thing in life is to enjoy ourselves, and to do what we love doing, NOT to "stay relevant" or make money or expand our client list or market ourselves successfully. I can continue to enjoy the photography that I do without learning new skills and without adapting to new technologies. However ..... I must admit that I enjoy my images more now than I did a few years ago, thanks to me now using Topaz for sharpening and noise removal. And I will enjoy photography even more when I learn how to use mirrorless cameras and the automatic subject-detect autofocus capabilities. So there certainly is a place for learning new things and adopting new technologies. But we should learn new things so that we can enjoy photography more and derive more personal fulfillment from it, not so that we can make more money from it. . Don't let it get you down! Remember, I'm solely talking about finding business success in photography here. The beauty of it as a hobby is that you can do it however makes you happy. That being said, your perspective about finding your niche and serving it well is valuable wisdom. There's definitely room for photographers who excel at their craft without chasing every trend. The key is being intentional about which changes to embrace and which to ignore, which is something that comes with experience like yours. Great Article, However when do you realize that no matter how hard you learn technology, You will always be behind? I was a computer tech for 30yrs, It wasn't until I stopped trying to be master of all and just focused on being a great tech, that I realized you can chase knowledge, but will have no understanding. You have to figure out what you want to be a master craftsman of and do that. Over time it won't matter about the chase, because what you chase will now chase you! Just learn how to take the best photographs you can and the rest will come in alignment. People go to school all their lives, and never realize, that maybe if they had just focused on one thing, eventually they would became the master they wanted to be. Be true to yourself and you will learn more than anyone who spends wasted hrs, days and most of their lives trying to keep up with what everyone else says is the standard. When you are unique, having wisdom and understanding, People will see that and you won't ever become outdated. What a wonderfully uplifting and valuable perspective. While simply a schlub amatuer, I did spend 30 years in technology sales and responded to dozens if not hundreds of RFPs and frankly nearly all were boilerplate requirements that had nothing to do with the actual job or equipment needs. I strongly suspect that what you see in requests and Linkedin ads is similar boilerplate. You need to understand the project scope and the expected outcome, then tailor your response to that. If the do need some esoteric photo tech that you don't use, then pass, but most likely showing that you understand what they want and can demonstrate that you have done similar work, will most likely hand you the job. My companies succeeded because of three things, our reputation, the reputation of the products we represented and our relationship with the consultant and/or decision makers. Fantastic point. Many, many (many, many) job postings and the like really are just boilerplate, and it comes down to the ability to read between the lines. There's an interesting parallel with the printing industry. While digital equipment has taken the spotlight in the last decade or so, there's a niche printing business that uses old (sometimes 100 year-old or more) vintage letterpress equipment for producing small quantities of specialty print jobs such as wedding invitations and retail hang tags.... something with tactile benefits not found in high-speed offset or digital printing. If you're familiar with 19th century printing presses, you're aware of how labor intensive setting up a press with individual blocks of type was for those people tasked with the job. Back then they had no better way. Now people do it for the love of traditional methods, and there's a market for the products. "Made-By-Hand" is no exaggeration. While it may not be a script for everyone, there are businesses looking to the past rather than the future for their strategic plan. That's super interesting, and I think you're right. I've noticed a big uptick in businesses going that route as a way to distinguish themselves in the last decade or so. Terrific in-depth article! I think the term "obsolete" goes too far - it's more like "obsolescent," meaning becoming obsolete. You actually bring up a great point. I had forgotten to examine the semantics of the title. Technically, none of us have skills that are obsolete. We just don't have the skills that are currently necessary. By that I mean that the few skills that I do have are not obsolete, as they are actually skills that are required and necessary to function as a photographer today. BUT ....... there are many other skills, that I do not have, that are also necessary to function as a photographer today. I mean, with the wording of the title in mind, could the author tell me which one of my skills is now obsolete? I think it is more accurate to say that we still need all of the skills we have, but that we also need additional skills. I think, in light of the point that you bring up, that a more accurate title would have used the word "skillset" instead of skills. Either that, or completely rework the wording of the title in order to conform to pedantic precision.

UPDATED 11:55 EDT / JULY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante While the Nasdaq seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued market uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news, but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to over-rotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes that could potentially be achieved much more cost-effectively with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise information technology spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending, and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during era of the cloud, mobile, software-as-a-service, social and big data. Each wave is different, but two common themes remain: 1) strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2) fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision-making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. In this Breaking Analysis, we take a look at the quarterly spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and give you our take on what’s happening in the market at the macro and how the spending climate has changed. We’ll quantify the stubborn weight of uncertainty, both technological and policy-driven, and convey how enterprises are responding. Let’s start with a look at tech spending sentiment going back to the boom times in 2021. This data from ETR shows the quarterly expectations of annual IT spending growth from around 1,800 IT decision-makers. As we’ve discussed in the past, we’re well off the halcyon high single digits from the isolation economy. Calling your attention to 2025 in the above chart, we entered this year with ITDMs expecting a healthy 5.3% increase in annual spending, which declined to 3.4% this spring and has slightly upticked in the July 2025 survey to 3.6%, still well off the January highs. Of greater concern is that large spenders, reflected by the G2000 data, expect a 2.9% increase, with SMBs more optimistic at 4.5%. The reason for the concern is small and midsized firms are more susceptible to policy shifts such as tariffs, and their ability to shield the hit is lower than large global firms. It’s interesting to plot the change in tech spending against the two-year treasury as we show here. The blue line is the price of the two-year, which is basically inversely proportional to the tech spend sentiment. In 2022 we still had the exuberance hangover from COVID, and as interest rates spiked, tech spending expectations slowly waned (from roughly 7% to 6%). But as reality set in, you can see the July 2023 spending trajectory tanked to under 3% and has remained in the mid-3% range since. In addition to the factors we mentioned at the beginning, cyber risks have escalated along with all the geopolitical gymnastics, leading to this persistent caution that we’ve cited. An interesting data point from a previous ETR Macro Survey is shown here – gauging the degree to which geopolitical and other concerns have affected organizations’ posture toward operational resilience. We can look at this data as a large percentage of customers are making resilience a high priority. Are the ones on the right more exposed or are they more resilient already? We don’t know from this data other than it conveys resilience has become a top concern, which we’ve already known for quite some time. A main reason for this sentiment is with all the changes organizations are facing – geopolitical, the pace of AI, policy uncertainty and the like – cyber risks are cited by ITDMs as their No. 1 concern. And perhaps the most difficult to address. The urgency is shown below in this graphic from a recent study by theCUBE Research, led by Christophe Bertrand, quantifying the time it takes to recover from a cyberattack. The leftmost data asks 600 organizations to estimate how long it would take to recover from an attack and the rightmost chart asks those who actually experienced a cyberattack how long recovery took. On the right – those who have experienced an attack – only 2% can recover in a matter of hours and only 12% less than a day. The majority of respondents in both data sets face multiple days to recover. Christophe’s research quantifies the cost of such disruptions and there are many studies that do so as well. But the key points are: 1) the productivity hit of an attack is many days or weeks of lost productivity; and 2) organizations are beginning to understand the realities and are generally realistic about their capabilities. The other factor to call out is that budgets aren’t unlimited . In addition to keeping the lights on and running the business, organizations have to grow and transform the business. So they have to fund new line-of-business initiatives, fund AI and keep iterating on cyber. All of these factors weigh into the macro spending data we shared earlier. For those organizations feeling the budget pressures and decreasing spend, how are they doing that? The following data depicts the approaches used. On balance, only 20% of organizations in this study are reducing their IT spending. That’s down from 24% two years ago, which is a positive. And they’re doing it by cutting staff as you see on the left most set of bars. That approach is back to the highs of last fall. And you can see new projects getting delayed. While this is the second most common technique, it is declining in popularity. Further to the right, you can see reducing cloud expenses is picking up steam. Let’s dig into this a little more deeply and look at how organizations approach increasing their IT spending shown below. New project acceleration remains the top appraoch. Expansion of cloud resources, while still number two is in decline. So based on this and the previous data, you may surmise that the cloud is under pressure. The data below shows spending by category – Cloud, Hardware, Outsourcing and SaaS. Though the previous data could be interpreted as negative, the cloud still far outpaces the other broad areas shown, with 8.1% annual growth, more than double the macro average, and far above hardware, outsourcing and SaaS, which are all in the low or lower single digits. Remember, cloud revenue for just the big three hyperscalers plus Alibaba will surpass $250 billion this year, growing revenue in the mid 20s for the group – so still very strong and outpacing other sectors. Cloud is being propelled by AI, a strong base of existing workloads that continue to grow and a flywheel of ecosystem vendors the like of which doesn’t exist on-premises. Let’s close with a view on what the outcomes are that organizations are seeing from their AI spend. The vendor narrative at conferences is that we’ve exited the experimentation phase for AI and we’re entering deployment at scale. We don’t quite see it that way. Most customers continue to tell us that their AI is nascent and largely experimental, with uncertain return on investment. This in many ways is good news in that the potential for increased value is enormous – if you believe (as we do) that AI is a durable trend. The data above shows that AI is most typically being used to enhance productivity and augment mundane human tasks. Supporting better analytics is sort of a no-brainer. When you have good analytic data – for example in Snowflake or Databricks or a cloud warehouse/lakehouse – bringing AI into the mix makes a lot of sense, is less risky and represents low-hanging fruit. The third bar above – transformation with new revenue streams – will take more time in our view, but the net present values will be much larger than we’re seeing today with early AI experiments. The drop off to No. 4 is notable – headcount avoidance or reductions – but it’s real and tangible that AI will affect jobs. And surprisingly, or not, 10% still are really not going after AI in these stated areas. Our interpretation is they’re waiting for the pioneers to take the arrows. Let’s come back to the point on productivity. As we’ve shared in previous Breaking Analysis segments, there have really only been two sustained decade-long productivity booms since Word War II. The first was in the post-war era with a massive increase in manufacturing in the United States. This spurred a consumer buyer flywheel that drove productivity in the late ’50s into the ’60s. The second major uptick was due to the personal computer productivity boom in the 1990s. Many – us included – believe that we are on the cusp of another sustained period of productivity growth, globally. Let’s think about this for a moment. VC investments in AI were around $50 billion in 2023, more than doubled last year and are on pace to increase this year. The big three hyperscalers plus Meta Platforms will spend well north of $300 billion this year on capital spending. So let’s round way up and say $500 billion is being spent on AI, with – as we said – limited return on capital at the moment. Sounds like a lot, right? Half a trillion dollars for a marginal return? But let’s step back. The annual global economy is north of $100 trillion. People are talking about 10%, 20%, 30% improvements in productivity. Let’s take 10%, which by the way would be a massive positive to the economy. That’s a $10 trillion annual increase in productivity. So taken in that context, $500 billion maybe isn’t that outrageous and perhaps is even conservative. The question for you is should you dive in or wait? There are many examples of where fast followers have thrived in these new waves. Facebook wasn’t the first social media company. Dell wasn’t the first PC maker. Google wasn’t the first search engine. So over rotating on capital allocation early in a cycle can be dangerous. At the same time, not participating will almost certainly leave you behind. So our advice is: Those your organization will know where to deploy the agents. Your job as an executive is to provide the North Star direction, a foundation of a solid data strategy and the tools and resources so they can make it happen. We’re very excited about the future, as I’m sure you are too. The macro uncertainties are always there – even when things are booming, there are blind spots around every corner. So hopefully our data and your knowledge of the market can help you navigate the unknown. We’re looking forward to being on the journey with you.

Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The big picture: As tech giants pour more money into AI, some warn that a bubble may be forming. Drawing comparisons to the dot-com crash that wiped out trillions at the turn of the millennium, analysts caution that today's market has become too reliant on still-unproven AI investments. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, recently argued that the stock market currently overvalues a handful of tech giants – including Nvidia and Microsoft – even more than it overvalued early internet companies on the eve of the 2000 dot-com crash. The warning suggests history could soon repeat itself, with the buzzword "dot-com" replaced by "AI." In the late 1990s, numerous companies attracted venture capital in hopes of profiting from the internet's growing popularity, and the stock market vastly overvalued the sector before solid revenue could materialize. When returns failed to meet expectations, the bubble burst, wiping out countless startups. Slok says the stock market's expectations are even more unrealistic today, with 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios now exceeding the peak of the dot-com bubble. Click to enlarge A company's P/E ratio measures the relationship between its stock price and the profit it generates, with a high ratio reflecting optimism about future returns. Comparing S&P 500 ratios at five-year intervals from 1990 to 2025 clearly shows the dot-com spike in 2000. Similar spikes in 2020 and 2025 suggest the AI bubble may be even more pronounced. What's more concerning is that in each spike, the top 10 companies' ratios far exceed the rest of the index. Such disparity suggests investments in those firms – mostly tech giants heavily betting on AI – have detached from reality before their newest technology can generate real profits. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla account for most of the S&P 500's recent growth. Slok's warning echoes concerns from other industry leaders about the risks facing AI companies. Robin Li, CEO of Chinese internet giant Baidu, predicted that only about one percent of AI firms will survive if and when the bubble bursts. He said this will eventually lead to a more stable market with more realistic AI applications. Tech giants continue to make massive investments as AI's popularity grows, underscoring the high stakes in this rapidly evolving field. OpenAI is developing an AI-powered web browser to challenge Google Chrome's dominance. Meta is spending over $60 billion to build new AI data centers. Microsoft recently cut 9,000 jobs to offset costs from its new AI infrastructure, estimated at $80 billion. Amazon has unveiled plans for agentic AI, signaling that the race for AI leadership shows no signs of slowing.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Update: Banks Beat

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Banks provided a strong start to the second quarter earnings season. During this busy earnings week, ... More the crucial technology companies begin to report, including Google's parent, Alphabet. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) The second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear this week. 110 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report, with more banks but also expanding to other industries. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Coca-Cola (KO), ServiceNow (NOW), United Rentals (URI), and Intel (INTC) As forecasted in last week’s earnings preview, the banks got the earnings season off to a strong start. According to FactSet, a robust 83% of S&P 500 companies are reporting earnings above the consensus estimates. S&P 500 Earnings Season Summary Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 5.6% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.3%, and for 2026, the expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary The S&P 500 rose modestly last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed. Market Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 should experience 14.1% year-over-year earnings growth for the quarter, compared to 3.4% for the other stocks in the S&P 500. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results this week, with Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) after the close on Wednesday. Tesla enters the week with low expectations, but Alphabet is expected to report robust earnings growth. The details for Alphabet will be necessary, as the stock has been held back by worries that artificial intelligence (AI) will disrupt their search business. While this disruption seems inevitable, the ability of Google to monetize AI-driven search will be crucial. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth Positive earnings surprises from the financial sector were the most significant contributor to the improved earnings picture. Better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Goldman Sachs (GS) were the most significant contributors last week, according to FactSet. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 4.4% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be further upside to sales growth. Better sales results in the financial and healthcare sectors were the most significant driver of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Sales Growth Estimates By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter in the previous year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. Goldman Sachs estimates that a 10% depreciation in the US dollar increases S&P 500 earnings per share by 2-3%. Furthermore, companies tend to have an easier time outperforming consensus sales growth estimates during periods of US dollar weakness. Notably, the technology sector has the highest international sales exposure of all the S&P 500 sectors. US Dollar Weakness Earnings should be the main event next week. There are some economic releases scheduled, but all are likely second-tier barring a considerable surprise. The better-than-expected retail sales report last Thursday provided more evidence that the US economy remains resilient despite the tariff increases, which drove the betting odds of a 2025 recession even lower. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession Despite noting that he is unlikely to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell, President Trump continues to pressure him and refuses to rule out the possibility if fraud is involved. This conflict has the potential to add market volatility, with betting markets indicating a 21% chance of Powell’s removal. Betting Odds Of Fed Chair Powell's Removal News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will continue to be a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. The Financial Times reported that President Trump was considering tariffs of 15-20% on imports from the European Union, an increase from the current 10% baseline tariff.

At a minimum you would be talking about a team of chefs, groundskeepers, maintenance staff, serving staff, cleaners, etc. So I am thinking maybe a few dozen all told with some living on site. At least the interior is done in warm colours where some mansions featured on NC have interiors that can be at best described as tacky, cold and jolting to the eye. 1) It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live. 2) If I can pay $250M for such a mansion, why would on earth would I bother with a “non-functional helicopter” blocking the helipad, instead of a working one? 3) It is supposedly full of art — I could not find anything looking like it (but what do I know about the recent trends and tastes of the high gentry). The huge camera sculpture is supremely tacky. 4) A bowling alley? A screening room with seats that become beds?? A wall of candy??? 5) No books. Anywhere. 6) Why all the giant displays everywhere — including outside the house? 7) Why were the bathrooms not shown? All of it gives me a slight impression that it was generated by AI. “It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live.” Maybe somebody will buy it and make the most expensive Airbnb property. Cleaning fees or requirements could address Rev’s questions about the maintenance expenses. The most likely customers/clients could be young professionals doing their “micro-retirement”. Turns out a lot was unexplained here. The “non-functional helicopter” was a collectible from a TV show. The house was indeed listed for $250 million, maybe as a publicity stunt, but then sold for a mere $94 million (chump change by comparison) way back in 2019. It’s been noted here about the muted colors in movies now, with technical explanations about post-production predominating. But comparing automobile colors from the ’70’s to now, what was day-glo has become dark-green being a bold individualistic statement. There’s more shine, but not more saturation. A main axis of the World Values Survey is ‘survival / self-expression’. Is it consumer preference driving the wash-out? Or is it, you’ll eat what you’re served? Images of traffic jams in Brazil (a high self-expression country) look as washed-out as here, so that indicates the latter. A brief walkthrough of a Kardashian mansion I saw had no color, only glass and white, and no individual signification. No family pictures on the wall, just corporate art. Lifeless. With respect to cars, in my experience, the cars that are black or white are the least expensive. The red, blue or sparkly paint cars also have more expensive equipment packages. The sparkly paint is also more expensive to repair as I learned when someone bonked into my car with black sparkly paint as I was putting kids and groceries in the car and then drove off The last car I have had that wasn’t black or white was in high school when I got my mother’s tan jeep as a hand me down. It includes a car collection so that’s pretty cool I suppose. Probably none that should be driven in public of course. I get the bowling alley portion of the video clip, and I’m immediately reminded of the brutal and ultimate ending scene from what I call an epic film, There Will Be Blood. “I’m finished!” I’m most interested in the non functioning helicopter, and if I have to buy the rest of the mansion to get it, so be it. There Will Be Blood is based on Edward Doheny, a ruthless oil man. To make amends later in life he paid for the building of a large Catholic church on Figueroa St in LA, wags at the time called it ‘Doheny’s Fire Escape’ as it was pretty certain he was going to hell~ His mansion is now owned by something like the actor’s guild. I was there for a screening way back when. Then there is the story of his family yacht. Back in the 60’s I rubbed some shoulders with some nichiren shoshu crazies that cooked up a scheme to start a revolution in Mexico. For the first step (don’t ask me why) they hijacked the Doheny yacht. They were hunted down by the coast guard and prosecuted for piracy and attempted murder and half s dozen other crimes. Had to look… https://youtu.be/aKYCa56tDSw?si=nQI_VGx1N-3UmclP “I’m finished!” You must admit, he really didn’t have anything left to do after that. That’s why they’re called job creators Rev! Bring those Chinese kids in and save some money. It’s on the news. It was Clark Gable’s house. Beverly Hills. His widow refurbished it to sell it. This is on the news. re: US media How Public Media Lost The Federal Funding Battle, And What Happens Next To Stations, NPR And PBS https://deadline.com/2025/07/pbs-npr-funding-cut-explained-whats-next-1236461136/ Last time I looked every PBS program was preceded by a long list of oligarchs both living and dead who participated in its individual funding. Shouldn’t be too difficult to round up a few more to fill the funding gap. Look for the pinched reactionaries to next attack the NPR and PBS 501(c)3 status. What’s Ken Burns gonna do? I saw NPR manipulate a story to fit their agenda. They ignored facts and tried to inject uncertainty and doubt into an issue with which I was very familiar through work. That was years ago and they only got less objective and more obvious in their biases. Advice: Go to that permanent brunch and have another cocktail on their own nickel. Yesterday, while going to get our Muddy Fork croissants, the NPR man spoke of people who rode that plane, including Bill Clinton, who had ‘never been accused of any crimes.’ I’ve been used to the rhetorical twists. But to listen to him flat lie was the Timberlok in the coffin. Dan Schorr dies yet again. Stephen Colbert getting the axe. It’s unfortunate for the staff and apparently it was well staffed. I shed no tears, crocodile or other, for this individual. He turned into a political hack at best, far from his time at Comedy Central initially working for / with Stewart, then launching his own branded report show. Someone at that level and in a signficant role and time slot, well perhaps he and also the show writers, really could’ve done better than opening on a recurring “Two Minute hate speech” during the first Trump administration. Last year he did give a poignant, even heartfelt it seemed brief recap and memorial to country star Toby Keith. It started with an appearance by the Big Dog on the aforementioned CC show. Obviously the politics of these two entertainers varied quite much. And hey this proves the axiom, unless you own the company you can become expendable. Start a podcast…. everyone else has one. C’mon, man. Think of all the good things that Stephen Colbert has done that we can remember him by- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq76QSlRiPo (1:27 mins) I watched Colbert for a bit on Youtube back in 2016, when I followed American politics with interest. Soon came to the conclusion that it wasn’t for me. However, I did have a favourable impression of his immediate post-election performance. It had the air of someone talking shocked and anguished people off the ledge, which I do think is a good thing to do, even if the people in question and their tragedy are a little hard to take seriously. That said he also seemed to be the sort of entertainer who’s squarely oriented towards cheering up a particular political grouping, in his case the Democratic faithful, and not doing anything more interesting or complicated. Good for them (or perhaps bad now, but I doubt he’ll just disappear – he has talent for this specific thing he does). People like him are the part of the problem, doing brainwashing of the populace for the benefit of the “elite”, and hence the Guillotine Watch material. They deserve real axe. Staff too, because the “I was just following orders” talk works only in the minds of those saying it. I remember being astonished at public outlets going along with the dissing of Sanders, outright misleading of listeners, who went out and backed Clinton and Biden as ‘more electable’. How’s that working for ya, PBS? The high point of Colbert’s career IMO…His performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner 2006. He ultimately became the person he used to mock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-a2KeyCAY His brilliant best, relentlessly oblivious as his audience stopped laughing and viewers at home couldn’t stop. Turned out his advantage was playing a character, rather than being himself. I won’t miss him either but I’ll always miss his smug, glib blinkered alter ego. Re: How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Dream on. I have to admit that the first thought that popped into my mind in reading that headline was ‘How can cannibals stop being cannibals? By not eating people.’ Yeah, not going to happen. So, ‘How can Democrats win back working-class voters?’ By offering immediate material benefits to their lives. Also not going to happen. One concern I have is that Trump’s policies will make the status quo ante more appealing to voters. There are no cannibals in our village any more. We ate the last one yesterday. and then there’s this take-down of AOC by Caitlin Johnstone this morning – AOC is definitely honing her political chops and duplicity – https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2025/07/20/aoc-is-a-genocidal-con-artist/ reached out to share the AZ billboard of tRump from yesterday’s links with an acquaintance – her first response to me was, “I haven’t forgiven you yet for this past election. I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel” my transgression was not voting for Ms Giggles – my mistake was sharing for whom i did vote – and it wasn’t tRump – for some there is no hope and no rational debate – my daughter told me to just forget about political conversations with folks – shaking my head, she may be correct – Fetterman in disguise? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/30/cort-m30.html Never thought I would see the day where I was disappointed that AOC would vote against MTG. But here we are noticed in the MTG clip that she was disturbed by the fact that Israelis have Universal Healthcare and Subsidized College – would be interesting if she followed up on those too – does MTG not have an AIPAC handler? Re: AOC- I’m thinking AOC has dreams of becoming the future Nancy Pelosi with all the attached grift. So disappointing, along with Sanders. AOC’s concern that the Israelis need the money to buy more “defensive” weapons so they can protect themselves just helps Israel to fulfill the “Plan” to destroy Gaza and wage destruction across the Mideast. In the words of Mike Tyson ” Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face”. AOC’s “eat the rich” dress during the early stages of an ongoing Pandemic worn during a high end who’s who social event was by that point all anyone needed to know about how shallow and duplicitous she is. Leftists shouldn’t hate AOC less than the politicians to her right, they should hate her much more. It isn’t Mike Johnson’s responsibility to move the US government to the left, and it’s not Nancy Pelosi’s job. It’s hers. That’s what she was elected to do. That’s what she framed the goals of her entire political career as being. And she’s taking her stand firmly bracing against any leftward movement from America’s genocidal, warmongering, unjust, exploitative, tyrannical status quo. And this is why I particularly despise liberal Democrats. Republicans are at least honest about what they’re about. Democrats are “working tirelessly for a ceasefire” lol. Although when it comes to the Pandemic, an ongoing threat to the working class and humanity, most Leftists are missing in action as well. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. That is the Left as defined by the Right, and the “two” right-wing “parties” are in cahoots here: the right-wing left is very useful to the ruling caste, as the article posted by Jabura Basadai illustrates well. The Left that considers itself not to be liberal Democrats also abdicated any responsibility towards protecting the working class from an ongoing Pandemic. Find me any not-liberal-Democrat leftist blogger or podcaster that acknowledges the ongoing Pandemic. I’ll wait. UK reduces voting age to 16, aims to boost electoral participation – Scripps News Time for Semper to post the movie “Wild In The Streets”? :) Every satire and cautionary tale is becoming non-fiction/documentaries. If you become an adult at 16, then you can be enlisted and sent to fight and die at 16. Zelensky liked that. In the UK, you can sign the papers at 15 and join at 16! So your comment is sadly true enough. When people called for them to be aligned, they were thinking of the higher number…. At the same time, we are seeing the long infantilisation of the WEIRD adults. People do not form independent lives, households etc until 30+, instead living an extended adolescence through university. Indeed university itself is now being required to act in loco parentis of ostensible adults (there is a long and very sad campaign by parents of student suicides to force UK universities to do more bit the fundamental problem is 18 year olds are adults and if they want to fuck up, neither their parents nor an institution can or should babysit them; NB: this campaign is not about fixing negligent mental health care but about extending pastoral supervision). As a result, we should probably be *raising* the UK voting age to 25 or 30! What are the demographics for the 16 and under cohort in the UK? From the sad crime stories in big cities and economic distress everywhere, what are the risks of a surprising, non-Britishy result or two from the Council level on up the ladder? How soon will there be a Polymarket or similar betting pool on issues? Recently I’ve become of the opinion that voting age should be in fact raised to 40 to be honest. At 25 I was a veteran of three wars, two coup-de-tats, and several covert actions. I lacked educational experience but obtained my bachelors by 30. At 25, I had something to say based upon real-world experience, and believe me I would have said it if I could only articulate it well. All I had was my vote. Decades later I come across people far older than I– in their 60s, 70s, 80s– who have a child-like, simplified view of the world without the nuance and understanding that I had obtained by the age of 25, and you’re telling me that the voting age matters? Good point. Voters should be 25-65. We have had 16+ voting age in Scotland for about a decade, for the devolved Edinburgh but not Westminster government. I was fortunate enough to teach Modern Studies, aka Civics, at secondary level and even my cohort of 13 year olds were more thoughtful about voting than many adults. Age is not the most useful metric for being sensible enough to be trusted to vote. The youngsters all took their democratic privileges very seriously. Media disinformation and bias, plus the lying scum in the political class are the biggest drawback to sensible exercise of the vote, with 47 the porkiest pie teller I have ever encountered Re Did Trump Play a Role in Colbert–not only does the article not answer its own question but it also ignores the fact that Colbert was a government promoting outlet for his good friend Biden until last January. Additionally any broadcast outlet is by definition a government partner since their license grants them what was once a triopoly status and the ability to print money. That’s not nearly as true as it once was and for sure it was the Republicans who tossed the Fairness Doctrine. But one should certainly not judge the opportunist Colbert to be some kind of noble figure. For people like him it’s easy to be smug when you are preaching to the converted. Indeed your rice bowl depends on it. We do need the media to keep the elites honest but in that increasingly ownership restricted space there is little to keep them honest. One might even argue that’s the bigger problem. I read somewhere the show has been losing money for a long time. He was cancelled, not due to the losses of money, but because Trump wanted him gone. The same will happen to all the others that speak out against the Nazi regime. Losing money is just an excuse and not true. He should have never been canceled because he has the highest viewership of any of them, and is one of the greatest late night comedians ever. So I am told. Yea, and proof that propaganda works. From this side of the Atlantic, he seems as grindingly predictable in his gags and idées reçues as the “alternative” comedians were in the UK during the Thatcher years. Some of these were very funny and insightful people (Alexei Sayle) but not when they were on primetime. He is no loss. Amusingly, Trump seems to be the first President to generate the bent-out-of-shape media hatred that Thatcher did in the UK. She too was an arriviste vulgarian. So we can’t have an equal and opposite to Fox’s Hannity or so many other fox celebs beating the GOP drum? I don’t recall Colbert ever being successfully sued for falsehoods or various improprieties like Fox. I stopped watching Colbert when it got less satire and more cheer leading but as it is not fraudulent it should be taken as part of the political discourse however blinkered. I started to go down the rabbit hole to test the waters, primarily suits filed by X against channel this that and the other. Omg and SMH, it’s a list of law suits alright and likely one I can’t summarize well or with precision. I will likewise suggest, certain media channels proved their loyalty when they disquieted the notion of say for one example, the Hunter Biden laptop. Trump is a narcissist, this is a given. Fox news can spew a ton on information at the core audience and just on the other aisle, I’d argue that CNN or MSNBC have done and will continue as well. By the way, what is Don Lemon up to these days anyway? Oh, and Jake Tapper wrote a book to help assuage his hand in the ” Biden is mentally healthy and fully aware. “. Ugh, much of it requires a double take on most days. Other countries most likely have their news, the US has a large contingent of stenographers. Pick your favorite flavor of Kool Aid. And to add, the likes of a Sean Hannity, a Rachel Maddow, and until next May at least Stephen Colbert are paid quite well. My point is, as Mencken said, don’t underestimate the stupidity of the American electorate. So there are plenty supplying the koolaid. They are paid. Money is now speech. Just be glad there are still two major sides vying. When one side can shut down the other and instill loyalty oaths for law enforcement then we might be in trouble. Oh wait! I will concede you make a good counter point. We’re not yet at the level of say, Carnegie and his massive steel plants hiring Pinkerton’s to fire on the unruly mob of non union workers….not quite yet at any rate. To borrow a classic phrase generally attributed to financier Jay Gould, ” I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half…”. As someone else in comments often puts it, this timeline is lit. I agree, I shed no tears for Colbert himself. As soon as he hit the big time he was just another boot licker For the establisment elites. Quit watching him and the others a long time ago. Late night show comedians have not been funny or entertaining for years. A coupla years ago they had these American late night show comedians on late TV here in Oz as cheap fill. It was just garbage from end to end and I would rather watch an ancient rerun of Red Skelton and Jack Benny instead. At least they were funny. Benny Hill in 2028! Sure, he’s British and dead, but those things don’t seem to matter anymore in American politics. Absolutely Benny Hill and the only reason I did not mention him was because he was British. He was rude, crude, vulgar and sexist – and absolutely hilarious- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1FBqFOTLQ (4:34 mins) His life’s work reminds me of a tombstone I read about upon which the following words were carved- ‘R.I.P Here lies my Husband, he was Dishonest, erratic, Erotic, irresistable, Wanton, untrustworthy And a liar. Sadly missed by his Everloving wife.’ I had a feeling you and he got along. I’m a bit young to have followed him in real time, but I eventually caught up. Peace. Stephen Colbert was actually very, very funny in Strangers With Candy, a sitcom starring Amy Sedaris as a 40-something former addict and prostitute who returns to high school (Colbert plays a neurotic [and gay] teacher having a long running affair with a colleague). He did a great job as a “reporter” on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, way back when it was still funny, and invented a twisted conservative talk host persona for The Colbert Report – that show was likely the height of his talent expression. I still don’t understand what happened to his edge. There’s a clip of Amy Sedaris on The Late Show getting interviewed by him, both of them reminiscing about their débuts in the business, living in relative poverty, and you can see some of the real man revealed for a moment. And then it evaporates. Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner was when he peaked in my view. Actually making light of the sitting, war mongering, USA president (Bush II) and toady journalists, who were in attendance. Courageous stuff, given the potential for revenge from the targets of his humor. This version of Colbert may have simply been a product of his writers, and not evidence of a critical, independent, thinker one could respect. But one can be sure he banked a lot of coin in his career. I think it is not really such a wonder that a strongly Democratic-aligned comic would courageously assail some Republicans. Nor is it in any way incompatible with his career since then. Stewart was funny back in the day. Carolinian Colbert played a parody rightwinger on that show and later on his own Comedy Central show. Perhaps it’s an indication of his true lack of bite that the latter was surprisingly popular among conservatives. I’ve always thought his comedy was more pandering than satire but that’s just me. Lenny Bruce he is not. The pandering got worse when he made the big time at CBS. And to say he’s better than his lame late night competition is not much of a boost. The funniest thing from Jon Stewart is when he presented a medal to a Nazi at the Disney World. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFpHtufCIZ4 Re; People Are Becoming Obsessed with ChatGPT and Spiraling Into Severe Delusions “…Vasan agrees that OpenAI has a perverse incentive to keep users hooked on the product even if it’s actively destroying their lives.” “The incentive is to keep you online,” she said. The AI “is not thinking about what is best for you, what’s best for your well-being or longevity… It’s thinking ‘right now, how do I keep this person as engaged as possible?'” We’ve seen this before, and many of us here likely have experienced lost or ruined relationships in our lives because of it: Facebook’s ethical failures are not accidental; they are part of the business model Facebook’s stated mission is “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” But a deeper look at their business model suggests that it is far more profitable to drive us apart. By creating “filter bubbles”—social media algorithms designed to increase engagement and, consequently, create echo chambers where the most inflammatory content achieves the greatest visibility—Facebook profits from the proliferation of extremism, bullying, hate speech, disinformation, conspiracy theory, and rhetorical violence. Facebook’s problem is not a technology problem. It is a business model problem. This is why solutions based in technology have failed to stem the tide of problematic content. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8179701/ Pain (upon others) = Profit (for shareholders) Who wants to tie this in to “our” law-makers personal investment portfolios?

The process is an A/B testing group which measures how long the user stays at the site and there is only one measure anybody cares about and that is to keep them online.

She gets writing tools that can be used to make shanks. That’s some self-protection. Supposedly she had already been moved to a cushy white collar crime type facility where shankings are rare. As for The New Republic up in Links, Max Blumenthal on a podcast asked why the Dems hadn’t used Epstein against Trump long before and that’s an interesting question. I probably follow the news more than your average MAGA but didn’t know that Trump and Epstein were15 year bosom buddies. This weekend’s NYT story even cites an incident where Epstein brought one of his girls up to Trump Tower for a visit. It’s impossible that Trump didn’t know what was going on and suspicions that he participated need only the slightest verification. Hubris meets nemesis. On the plus side Mrs. Vance will make a nice first lady. Sooner than we think? Well Max Blumenthal should know that the reason why the Dems could never use Epstein against Trump and the Repubs as doing so would burn a lot of their own donors. And it would certainly drag down Bill Clinton as he used to take flights on the Lolita Express which would also mean that Hillary Clinton would get dragged down as well. In wrecking the Repubs, the Dems would wreck themselves so we have a MAD situation here. Dems are as involved with Epstein, etc as the RINOs. When does US stop suffering pedophiles? How do we become a sane nation? When do we insist our weapons not be used for genocide? Probably, at least 10 or 20 years after we stop rewarding calculating, ruthless, back-stabing, greed driven psychopaths to promotions on the ladder towards CEO. We bemoan the ethical and wisdom lapses up at the top of the pyramid, and ignore that the entire base of the pyramid is infested by equally poor barely human specimens. The rot goes all the way down. It’s as if the proverbial small town used car salesman or crooked sheriff broke out of their niche and infected the rest of the population. Time for society to have a hard look in the mirror. This is what ‘we’ want, apparently, since it’s what ‘we’ reward. Thank you for writing this, cfraenkel. In my opinion, the role of the US population in US decline warrants far more discussion. I believe the US population is not just a passive victim, but in many cases an active participant, e.g. by continuing to refuse to hold the people that have been wrecking the country for decades now accountable in any meaningful way. At the very least, more people could stop legitimizing the current system by refusing to vote, but even that is apparently too much to ask. So we get the “leaders” we deserve, I guess. Leaders in Washington and State capitals who ignore their constituents and grovel for money by selling their souls to high bidders, and the occasional blackmailer! Make the processes transparent and auditable. Maybe one of the brewing scandals will help clean out Washington for a new crew. In my opinion, that’s wishful thinking at this point. I suggest we use our power over our own actions to withhold our consent to be governed. Votes can still be manufactured of course, but at least our conscience will be clean. Re: Human Programmer beats OpenAI (op cit) Gimme a break. Tom’s Hardware doesn’t give details about the challenge’s challenges, but it seems I first encountered this kind of problem (“dynamic programming”) back ca. 1980, matching speech signals to targets, and it was already an old problem, a variant of the “traveling salesman problem” in which a self-driving car has to cross Manhattan.

That big platform reaches a huge audience, non-geriatrics and those who don’t watch the shrinking nightly news. ‘Science girl @gunsnrosesgirl3 Jun 17 kindergarten lessons in China’ It’s a fascinating view of how another country sees education. The idea seems to be to make those kids self sufficient from an early age and develop their hand-eye coordination. It’s almost a meme how guys right out of high school have no idea about cooking and will just go for Door Dash instead or get their moms to make them something. Of course the comments for that video clip are mixed and some are really experiencing sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1935044059506295111 In USA they skip the manufacturing, and sent kids directly to sales and other services. Seems like a Chinese reinvention of Montessori…my kids did a lot of similar stuff, though definitely not at such a high throughput rate! I immediately thought the same thing: Montessori school with Chinese characteristics. Which is definitely cool. I’m sure there are reasons (maybe some cynical), but I’ve never understood why no country has ever tried just mainlining Montessori education into most of their schools. Hope there is a good Emergency Room nearby. Wonder how liability law works in China? I became a “latch-key kid” around that age, long before ambulance-chasers and St. Reagan’s intrusive nanny-state/authoritarian police state started sucking the life out of… well, pretty much everything. We’ve become a society of pussies where any risk is unacceptable to many– even calculated ones: pain, real pain, can be a valuable teacher, and I’m not talking about hurt feelings here (although those can have value too). Those kids are starting much earlier in life than ours, learning self-suffiency and skills necessary for “adulting,” things that many of our man-childs and 40-50 y.o. “girls” have never, and won’t ever, learn. I am impressed by what I see in the video, and am saddened by what I see being done to our youth as they are encouraged to distance themselves even further from life’s realities than even their parents likely are.

Another target for hackers! An electric scooter that accelerates faster than a Tesla Model 3? No thanks! The Verge Acceleration is not only about power-to-weight ratio, but also rubber meeting the road. In addition to that, going fast is not only about accelerating, but also slowing down. Small wheels (and small brakes) are inherently bad at that, because they are small. A team of ex-Formula One engineers knows that, which means they are just talking the talk for publicity. Also, the smaller the diameter of the wheel the higher the rpm, so going fast on these would probably require Formula One level maintenece. On a positive note, having an accident on these while driving at maximumu speed means that you won’t be suffering a lot. :) Anyone who took the trouble to get a mechanical engineering degree ought to be able to spot the truth being gently stretched in the article.

Just out of curiosity, are there many people here with enough money to spare that they need to find something to do with it, who don’t invest in something unethical? Starting a new job, and at a stage where the basics in life are sorted, and have the nice problem of not knowing what I will do with the money (which of course I will need to in-part use for retirement some day) – but after years of reading NC and the ills of ‘money making money’ in general etc. – am kind of paralyzed as to what to actually do with it, which isn’t going to be investing in something unethical one way or the other. So am curious if there are people who have successfully navigated this, and are doing well, without selling their soul and ‘buying in’ to one variety of evil or other, with their investments. Whether it is actually practically doable. I’m becoming more convinced that this is one of the ways – maybe even one of the primary ways – that economic conservatives and exploitative capitalists, achieve ‘buy in’ and votes among so much of the population: Corrupting their ethics/morals, through gains from unethical investments (that many people are not even initially aware they are investing in, e.g. hidden/obscured in pension portfolio company lists). Plenty of people turned off by the financial markets have sought to invest money in real estate; local rentals, AirBnBs, or flips, or land speculation. Which, perversely, has turned questionably ethical over the last 20 years, because these little real estate empires, along with the corporate ones, have jacked up prices and rents, and made affordable housing scarcer. Yet if you don’t want to invest in stocks and bonds, it would still certainly be wise to secure paid-off housing in an area you won’t mind living in if society ever goes seriously off the rails. I have long held a certain interest in local or state run credit unions, many of which have a local or regional tie to a former corporation or industry affiliation. Many of these succeeded as a basic truly co-operative, the largest are known by their TV ads or a sponsorship of a local arena perhaps. Navy Federal is a real big one. But as I’ve found before you just need to check around for one that suits your needs for competitive money market rates or even CD offerings. Making a key assumption here, this is a US focused inquiry. One minor note, free advice is often worth the price (!) In addition to local credit unions, there is a new category of socially and/or environmentally oriented financial service companies that are certified by the federal government if they invest primarily in local low-income markets. There are 1500 of them that specialize in lending to entities the banks either can not or choose not to reach….due to lower loan size or somewhat greater risk. The field is attracted talent and you can lend to them or deposit (if they are regulated. Most are non profit but some are small banks or credit unions. Meant to say, they are called “Community Development Financial Institutions” or CDFIs. There are project-specific municipal bonds. You’d be basically lending a city money for a project which you’d be able to get information about, at interest. If you don’t want to pay police salaries, for example, you could buy bonds for a park project. They have the added benefit of being one of the safer places to keep your money; cities rarely default. I’m glad you bring this up. The old standby, ‘no ethical consumption under capitalism’ comes to mind, though here we’re talking investing, not consumption. My own thinking for small-time retail investors is similar to my thinking on boycotts: individual choice in the market is not how social change happens, and the ownership of the stock market is so highly concentrated that the little guys making money adding their small savings to finance ugly business makes little difference, except in that it makes life easier for them. Interesting theory about the compromises we make for more money inculcating cynical, self-serving and immoral behavior. I wish you well, and hope that if you find another route, you’ll share! – ‘The CIA Initiated an Intelligence and Terrorist War on Russia Based on a Lie’ – Larry Johnson I somehow missed the original article by Tim Weiner in Foreign Policy that is the subject of this piece. I had just read it this morning (it was linked at MofA) and saw Johnson’s rejoinder here. I’m not sure if it was linked in NC earlier, but everyone should read it. It is quite extraordinary for all the reasons Larry points out and more. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such an unintentionally revealing article about an important subject (the CIA’s Russia House and its role in Ukraine) and also its author. If there were any doubts that Weiner is a complete “toady” for the CIA (to use Weiner’s own term), this article should dispel them. Unfortunately, because of all the despicable current actions by the Trump administration from Gaza to Ukraine to Epstein to DOGE to etc,.etc., it will be hard to take seriously any real “revelations” about Russiagate made by any of them. They will simply be seen as partisan rhetoric to deflect attention from Trump’s own evil actions (all of the sudden Gabbard has reappeared from oblivion to carry out this task for the MAGA faithful). And this will probably be correct. A curse on all their houses. Small ray of hope: Trump disses neo-con killapalooza: https://thehill.com/homenews/5410319-trump-administration-turns-hostile-on-aspen-security-forum/ LOL! Trump probably didn’t realize that he would be praised at the conference by Condi Rice for his recent “aggressive stance on Putin,” according to the article from The Hill posted above. A “bipartisan” conference of leading foreign policy elites. At the “Aspen Security Forum.” A panel “moderated by NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.” How could the Trump administration resist such an opportunity to share their views with the “foreign policy community”? >Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943 “Both [Poland and Ukraine] are modern European democracies that can handle an objective investigation of past atrocities in ways that a country like Russia unfortunately can not,” he said.

Ya gotta love how they take every possible opportunity to promote the bald-faced lie that Ukraine is a democracy, a modern, functional country. Before the SMO, it was “Europe’s most corrupt country” and “plagued by Neo-nazi nationalist movements”. Of course that’s all down the memory hole. Britain faces a test of identity: Will Britons become a minority in their homeland? – opinion Jerusalem Post https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-861437 The Jerusalem Post is concerned that young British Muslims are going on camps where some form of indoctrination apparently takes place. I remember going on a boy scout camp when I was 12 and we were fed tales of the Empire and the need to maintain our right control our our colonies as a Christian mission, forced to wear funny caps, scarves and toggles at all times, and listening to lots of Methodist guff around the campfire every evening. I buggered off home on the third day thumbing lifts all the way to my house and told my parents I had no intention of ever having anything to do with the scouts after that. I left the scouts and a couple of lads followed my lead because we saw the camp for what it was – a primer for the our right to defend the imperial system agin’ the dirty rat-fink commie coloureds in the colonies who wanted rid of our lovely Monarchy and Parliament. The Jews have their own indoctrination systems for young people which have had a much more serious negative impact on British, European and Amercan politics since the 1930s and which intensified after the war with the legitimisation of the settler colony. I find the idea that we will be outnumbered by Muslims in our own home less than likely purely on the basis of the demographics. I’m much more worried by the example set by Jewish and Christian Zionists in their wholehearted support for the Palestinian genocides than I am about Muslim girls’ fashion choices when camping, and the perspective that many Muslims and non-Muslims have on the political élite of the West given their open support for the deliberate murder and maiming of children who are inconveniently Palestinian by bombs, bullets and starvation – and it’s resulting power as a new iteration of the blood libel. The Zionists are attempting to extend their landholding by soaking it in the blood of the children they have sacrificed, and the blood they continue to sacrifice until they are stopped by military force as they continue to overreach, along with the Collective West by deploying the rundown Anglo-Saxon and European armouries. There was an interesting article featured in the links yesterday and one section really disturbed me. ” In response to a question in The Brothers Karamazov about whether Jews steal and kill Christian children at Easter, Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know”. That is quite the glib treatment of blood libel.” https://unherd.com/2025/07/why-gen-z-goes-mad-for-dostoyevsky/?us=1 On the contrary, it was a profound treatment of the extent of one’s knowledge and the nature of truth which gave me great pause and resulted in many discussions with my fellows when I was a nineteen year old student. “…Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know””. How can he know? What other answer can an honest man give? A convenient yes or no, expressing belief without authority, or “well I’m rather a bit of a sceptic about that, actually, old boy”, depending on the audience, or just speak the bare unvarnished truth. My reading and re-reading of Dostoevsky in many different translations over the years have merely reinforced my belief that the position taken by Alyosha is morally and intellectually correct. For the honest, it must always be the bare unvarnished truth – and that is something which seems to have got lost somewhere in my lifetime. I agree on that last part, and I think the author’s idea there was that one is supposed to always express the prescribed morally correct opinion on such things. Never mind that this prescribed morally correct opinion was not widely accepted at the time, and at any rate would indeed not have been honest (even moreso in the drastically different informational environment of 19th century Russia). Alyosha’s answer is not merely a morally correct one, but also a scientifically correct one–and one thst dovetails nicely with the Grand Inquisitor’s line (from the samd novel, obviously): all too often, we are too sure that everythingbwe think we know is “two times two,” just a matter of “mathematics” and selff evident truth. The situation is so bad in the West that even George Orwell fell into this mental trap. Something else was wrong with this Jerusalem Post article about the UK other then the jncongruity (seriously, Israeli commentary on UK social conditions? There’s no interest in Israel in Blighty’s crumbs. If they need a surveillance overflight from Cyprus, they can order it via Uncle Sam!) and that was the claim that Andrew Bridgend gave a speech in Parliament that 80% of thrle 250,000 rapes have been by Muslims. If he had said that, it would have been front-page news and I don’t remember it. Have I I just missed a memo? Does anybody else remember this? Or is this just more hasbara against muslims…? “Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943” Yeah, the Poles are not going to forget the Volyn massacre – nor should they. There are about 100,000 Poles buried in mass unmarked graves and the Poles want their remains exhumed. Needless to say the Ukrainians are not thrilled at this idea. Polish President Andrzej Duda got stuck into Zelensky about this massacre so of course Zelelnsky played dumb saying- ‘Andrzej, I’ve never heard of the murders, the killing of Poles in western Ukraine, in Volhynia. They didn’t teach us about it in school.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621319-zelensky-never-heard-nazi-crimes/ But the Poles will not let this go and it was only several years ago that they made a film about what happened back then- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0POxClxb8cM (1:00 min) Climate change as existential threat– However you want to define it, climate change constitutes a threat of catastrophe for humans and other life on Earth of almost inconceivable dimensions. Recent estimates for impacts on humans and their economy may not be existential, but they project a Mad Max world with billions of dead, billions more desperately seeking to migrate, drastic reductions in GDP far beyond that experienced in the Great Depression and unpredictable and deadly geopolitical and sociopolitical conflicts. Driving this disaster is a grotesque misallocation of wealth, income and consumption. Fifty per cent of carbon emissions are attributable to the world’s richest 10%. Moreover, in the USA, 50% of consumption comes from the richest 10%. This distorts the production of goods and services so that we have too little housing, health care, food and education for the poor, both in the Global North and Global South, and way too much in the way of affluent consumption like McMansions, SUVs, non-essential travel and boob jobs. Put succinctly, we’re burning up the planet to cater to the spoiled rich and affluent while billions go without basics worldwide. Thanks, capitalism. Economic anthropologist Jason Hickel and Australian Dylan Sullivan published a paper in World Development Perspectives last September that laid out a plan for change that would avoid a catastrophic breaching of Earth’s boundaries while eliminating global poverty: Strategies for development should not pursue capitalist growth and increased aggregate production as such, but should rather increase the specific forms of production that are necessary to improve capabilities and meet human needs at a high standard, while ensuring universal access to key goods and services through public provisioning and decommodification. At the same time, in high-income countries, less-necessary production should be scaled down to enable faster decarbonization and to help bring resource use back within planetary boundaries. With this approach, good lives can be achieved for all without requiring large increases in total global throughput and output. Provisioning decent living standards (DLS) for 8.5 billion people would require only 30% of current global resource and energy use, leaving a substantial surplus for additional consumption, public luxury, scientific advancement, and other social investments. No, it will not put a Ford Expedition in every McMansion garage nor a porterhouse on every grill, but it will meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for everyone (as adopted by Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics) as it solves our society-disrupting inequality. I encourage readers to check out Hickel’s and Sullivan’s paper while suspending questions of political feasibility. Does it seem plausible otherwise that the move toward eco-socialism could end the charge over the cliff while providing a decent life for everyone on the planet? Is there anything truly necessary or essential that would be lost? If the plan strikes you as reasonable, what, or more accurately who, blocks its adoption? i’m, of course, all for it. but literally everyone i know in real life would be absolutely terrified and/or enraged….the 100 year Mindf^ck about what socialism, etc actually is…or could be…has been very effective. True enough. But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them. One of the big problems is the array of forces that have expended great effort and huge sums of money aimed at planting just enough doubt in people’s minds to give them cover to roll with Business As Usual. The people behind that will have those billions who die on their karma. And before long, that sharp down slope is coming anyway. This just keeps the party going for 10% of the world’s population a little longer. “But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them.” But do they really care enough? Most I know bury their head in the sand, outright deny the issues, or brand them a liberal hoax. The “aware” parents are mainly focused on setting their kids up to be the fortunate ones who will have the resources to rise above the rabble in hard times. That said, even if they really do care enough I don’t know what they can really do about it. Are they gonna raise their kid to be a survivalist? Raise them in a eco commune? We all feel powerless to change anything systemic so why not raise kids to be successful capitalists so that they will hopefully be on top when the pyramid scheme of modern society collapses. Better odds that way. As was said above, our best hope is to somehow radically reform incentive structures but in a society where public grocery stores in NYC is branded a communist takeover, feeding the homeless can be a crime, and healthcare for sick children is controversial, I highly doubt we are capable of anything remotely resembling a system that rewards those who do work benefitting others. Even if we could we’d need to get people like Jamie Dimon to accept he is in fact not doing God’s work. A while back a younger friend asked me if I thought we could ever make the changes needed to become a better society. I said, “Sure. We’ve done it before. All it took was two world wars and a Great Depression for western society to make some positive lasting systemic changes.” Or, as the quote often misattributed to Churchill goes, “We always do the right thing after we’ve exhausted every other possibility.” “20-Million-Year-Old Rhino Fossil Rewrites Evolutionary History” Wouldn’t it be fascinating if they found the body of a frozen North American Indian in the permafrost from 30,000 years ago when the first of them were arriving in this empty double continent. Think about what could be revealed by an analysis if their teeth and what it would tell us of who these first people were. There were a few findings along those lines, eg the Kennewick Man. People took them and their implications badly and the inconvenient findings were literally buried with claims that they were inconclusive, using the laws originally created to prevent grave robbing of old Native American burial grounds. Yes, when fossil evidence goes against dogma, it takes a long time for it to be considered evenhandedly. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/jacques-cinq-mars-bluefish-caves-scientific-progress-180962410/ I see what you mean- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man re: WWII interview German blog NACHDENKSEITEN has a long interview with WWII historian Paul Chamberlain. If interested use google to translate (archive.is wouldn´t work today) Interview with Paul Chamberlin: The Second World War as a war of racist empires – on both sides Paul Thomas Chamberlin is a professor of history at Columbia University and a renowned expert on 20th century international history. His writing has appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post , among others . He is the author of the highly acclaimed book “The Cold War’s Killing Fields,” in which he reveals the bloody global dimension of the Cold War. In his new work, “Scorched Earth: A Global History of World War II,” Chamberlin takes a radically different look at the Second World War: not as a battle between good and evil, but as a brutal conflict between imperial powers – on all sides. He shows that the Allies and the Axis powers were often frighteningly similar in their colonial ideology, their war crimes, and their treatment of the civilian population. In this interview, he talks about repressed chapters of war history – and why the Second World War must be retold. The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 More like that’s a new idea for some European historians and students… I think the myth that WW2 was a moral crusade against fascism, rather than a struggle between self-interested states, is not going to die any time soon. After all, people have been refuting it since the event itself, and any serious examination of it would point towards a more critical view as well. (A more critical view that, it ought to go without saying, does not mean it would’ve been better or even just as bad if the Axis powers had won.) An even worse version I see from time to time (though notably always in English, not Russian) is that WW2 was fought to save the Jews from the Nazis – judged by that standard, though, it was not very successful. Not to mention that back during WW2 that was the line of the Nazis and their sympathisers (I remember Mosley writing to that effect, for example), not of their opponents. Pardon my cynicism, but it seems to me that a lot of people throughout the Western world and (with some tweaks) in the former USSR want to believe in the Good War in which the Good Guys beat the Bad Guys, without any ambiguities or complications. It is both genuinely reassuring to the people and very useful to the powers that be and their intellectual support, who keep finding new Hitlers to oppose. The Allies’ actions such as air bombings and ethnic cleansing are very useful in that regard too: if it was okay for Good Guys to do it then, it is this much harder to complain about them doing it to someone else now. I suppose it still does some good to keep restating it and providing further proof, even if the basic thesis here seems so obvious that its rejection must be rooted in psychological and political factors that aren’t susceptible to arguments or evidence. I think this linecof thinking goes back ultimately to the notion of so called “just war” itself, as that implies that there are some wars, if the cause is just enough, that you ought to be proud of. Since wars invariably turn “evil” in its conduct on all sides (atrocities against civilians, hypocrisy, etc), this gives justification to the excuses that these evils are justified because they were doing greater good, the other side deserved them, etc., feeding even more hypocrisy. It would be far more honest if we could just fess up that, no matter what, to war is to sin and to sin gravely, and that we should try to minimize the evil that we do nevertheless and hope that God, if there is one, will forgive us, with the recognition that such forgiveness is not guaranteed. The trouble with the modern Christianity, at least the way it has developed in the West, is that we have lost the idea of sinning, at least when it is we who sin. Instead, we think of ourselves as instruments of divine justice, and so doing, mistake ourselves for God. Excellent diagnosis. re: WWIII RU – Pascal Lottaz from Neutrality Studies interviews Dmitri Trenin. Martyanov used to not regard Trenin as a real expert in military affairs. Which he probably is not as far as real professionals are concerned. I already wrote that it is odd if one particular individual is always being inquired on a variety of highly special subjects when it comes to a certain larger power regarded as hotile. 35 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giN29jR7VRc I always thought that was funny because, iirc, Trenin was a GRU colonel and presumably, a graduate of the General Staff Academy, too. Martyanov is a bit too full of hinself more often than not. RE: Barack Obama Now Squarely in Russiagate Crosshairs Matt Taibbi I have no clue where this will go, but I’m guessing nowhere, like most other things I wish would actually go somewhere. These people don’t care about laws – they don’t apply to them. I would be nice to see St. Obama get what is due, but I won’t hold my breath. What will be interesting is the spin and lies. I have been gone so I have not talked to my PMC friends, but I’m guessing they won’t/don’t believe one bit of it. After all, Tulsi is a Russian asset according to Hillary and most of blue MAGA believe that. Russia is also controlling Trump so this is all lies and nothing could be true. They have too much invested in Russiagate and of course they can never admit they were wrong. But it would be nice, in this case, the Epstein case, or many other cases, these slimeballs would actually get what they deserved. But they won’t. They will continue to laugh in our face and get away with whatever they want. That’s one of the perks of being in the Big Club. I think it has already been decided by the highest court that Obama can’t be prosecuted for official acts but it is exciting to think that if associated persons can be prosecuted at this late date for said same then just maybe we can prosecute the war crimes of the Bush era. Arguably the bigger slimeballs than mere election meddlers. Agreed. Would love to see this heat brought upon the clan behind the biggest crimes of my lifetime. Can’t stand Obama and his “high priest of brunch” status but I’m old enough to remember Trump’s team of investigators who were going to expose the fake birth certificate. Not exactly a guy with a reputable track record on this and an odd one for Taibbi to be hitching his hopes to. https://www.civilbeat.org/2011/04/10184-trump-sends-birther-investigators-to-hawaii/ Christine Hunsicker, CEO of a Bankrupt Fashion Tech Startup, Charged for Alleged $300M Fraud Scheme -People Of course, I had to check to see if she had ever been a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum.

And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.” How many hospitals for Uyghurs have the Chinese bombed? What is her opinion on using British taxpayers’ money to support Israel? When I read ” Sub-Saharan Africa can’t afford to eat on a carbon diet”, I noticed that the article carefully zero-mentioned legume and non-legume bio-fixaton of nitrogen and also carefully zero-mentioned other soil-borne bio-fixation of nitrogen. It very carefully only mentioned the straw-man technology of electrolysis to produce “green” nitrogen. Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer and others ( so few that they can all be individually named) are getting yields comparable to the Haber-Bosch inputters without Haber-Bosch nitrogen OR strawman “green” nitrogen. African agriculturists could study Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer if they want to and see whether such methods can be used in SSA agriculture to fix all the crop-growing nitrogen which SSA agriculture would need to keep SSA fed. +1 Even their discussion of urea carefully mentioned only manufactured sources. In today’s Clown World, why Putin should fear Britain’s next fighter jet. 🤡 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/19/britains-new-giant-jet-fighter-prepare-marathon-russia-raid/ If Nato ever ended up at war against Putin’s Russia, experts say this means the aircraft would take off from a British airfield, fly to Russia undetected, destroy hostile air defences and then fly all the way back again. What this article leaves out is that there would not be a Britain to return to for this Wunderwaffe if it somehow fulfilled its fantastical mission. The fact that such tripe gets published shows us that the mainstream media have nothing except pure contempt for the rubes who read them. At this stage, anyone still believing anything they tell us is an imbecile who needs minding. Given that the RAF Tempest is supposed to enter service in 2035, there may not be much of a Britain to even take off from by then. We’ll probably see a flying prototype of the Su-75 before a one for Tempest. Even if it looks like Rostec has frozen the Su-75 development for now – Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov did promise a flying prototype by the end of this year, but so far only crickets from Sukhoi. Perhaps the Brits will be using a design similar to this for those covert raids. H/T Chas Freeman, who mentioned this during his latest interview with Nima, which also featured Lawrence Wilkerson. When I see the things happening all around me in my own medical world, in other words, the frank incompetence that just was not present as recently as 10 years ago, I often wonder how things are going in other parts of the world and economy that are just as complicated as medicine. https://x.com/aviationbrk/status/1946596722496491582 It just happened yesterday. Accidents and issues like this in aviation seem to be happening at an extremely high rate compared to just a few years ago. I am not even sure this is a Boeing issue or a Delta maintenance issue? I am not even remotely expert to make that decision. But these kinds of things are seemingly happening at an alarming frequency. I honestly do not remember this level of accident happening just a few years ago. It seems to be happening weekly and that has been true for the past several years. I know in my world of medicine that this incompetence is actually happening. In aviation, is this type of thing becoming more common or is it that we are just seeing more of it because of iphone cameras and social media? I believe a major contributor to increased errors with airplanes, significant uptick in auto accidents, etc., is our old friend, SARS CoV 2 and The Long-Term Sequelae. ‘Gone from the charts (only because we stopped collecting data) but not from our hearts! Or brains . . . It might be the wonderful gift of private equity at work again: https://truthout.org/articles/as-us-airlines-outsource-plane-repairs-private-equity-is-moving-in/ That’s a 24 year old 767-400ER so it’s all about good maintenance. I had thought Delta was still doing it’s own maintenance: Delta TechOps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_TechOps But I think even the majors are having a hard time getting good experienced people to do the work. PE owned, or flying out of the country for heavy maintenance, let’s hope these do not become common practices. You would think our ruling elites would have figured out that off shoring, out sourcing is not always a smart thing to do by now, but greed seems to over rule all else with these people. Anybody who is anybody is flying private these days. The thrust of history now read out digitally. Compelling. Thank you! We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. If you follow airplanes and I do, there are many sites from around the world that keep track of issues that might require return to the airport. This is much more common than you think, while still being a small %. One issue with US carriers is that they have some of the oldest planes in the world. Older planes will have more issues as there is just more time on the airframe and engine. Yes they meet all the maintenance standards but well shit happens. It is definitely not a boeing issue, boeing doesn’t make engines. As to a delta issue, once the NTSB issues its report we will find out if it was a part failure, or maintenance issue or something else. For example we don’t know if this was a new or old engine, was it recently rebuilt or near needing overhaul, did it ingest a bird causing damage? Every single airliner issue is investigated and a conclusion arrived at. if it’s something new, then it might cause a new check or requirement for an updated check protocol. We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. This reminded me of Russians dashcam videos of accidents. Lots of those around, because there are lots of dashcams in Russia. Just to note, the synchronized dives were two sisters; Lia Yatzil Cueva Lobato Mia Zazil Cueva Lobato . . . and not the names shared in the tweet. Credit where due. They looked so remarkably similar that I wondered. I kinda thought that they looked like twins myself. I note that a piece from the “The Ecomodernist” is included in today’s links. Have a large load of salt handy before entering; this substack is just a rebranding of the old “Breakthrough Institute” which provided a platform for technocracy fanboys (Nordhaus et al.) A sampling of receipts available at: “The New Denial is Delay” Everyone Warned the Breakthrough Ecomodernists Hijacking ‘Anthropocene’: Anti-green ‘Breakthrough Institute’ misrepresents science Rachel Pritzker is co-author of “The Ecomodernist Manifesto” and the money behind the Breakthrough Institute. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” They’re telling us the boys from tech will handle it without more than wishful thinking to back it up. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” Setting the bar pretty low! :) Anybody else going to Economic-Con? I’ll be doing cosplay as the total market value of the GDP, wearing thin. I’ll be going as the J P Morgan Silver Desk Jockey. You can’t miss me. I’ll be wearing paper shorts. Is this a thing? Could be, it’d be great fun. …what are you coming as? There are lies, damned lies and statistics…the Atlanta FED predicts the US is likely reflecting a rebound for the Q2 forecast…Funny but under a Democrat admin, a projected GDP at 2.0 to 2.5 was considered a positive goal. Opinions can vary! https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow Additionally, Islamic finance has its own rules, much-eroded by oil wealth and greed, but within Islam, interest is haram (there are ways around this), as is profiting from things like alcohol or pornography. There are some funds set up for the purpose of easing the consciences of Muslims, while providing them with passive income; you might look into those. How they deal with oil investing and the issues that faces us with, we’d have to check. But there’s another avenue to explore. Really, we’re dealing with our desire to gain without adding value by working. Poverty is probably purest (monks have long thought so), but everything costs money, and we can’t help others without standing on solid ground ourselves. How solid is solid enough? That’s personal preference, past a certain point. The other day, there was a piece hosted here by someone who had lived for years as a nomad. Others ‘need’ a certain quality in their food or shelter. Taking the extreme, if we were rapacious, and invested in everything ‘evil’ now, and it freed our comfortable retirements for volunteering our labor-time, would that justify having a portfolio of oil, weapons, tech, and drugs? No one wants their excess, if we have it, gnawed away by inflation. I really do look forward to hearing any thoughts you have on the subject. When we’re talking economic matters, it’s a shitty world, which we navigate but cannot, except in miniature, change. I’ve seen it said that the reason Trump is going after Brazil with tariffs is to put pressure on Lula, due to Bolsonaro’s ongoing Supreme Court case. Both are eyeball deep in the fundie evang crowd, discussed on NC years ago e.g. the actions of Bolsonaro’s mob in trying to keep power through violence.

RE: 100 MPH Scooter: Where I live these scooters are being sold to unsuspecting users out of former rental company stock’s. Fortunately, these scooters are now categorized as transportation devices and regulated in the same category as ebikes: no riding on sidewalks; bike lane speed of 20 MPH; max electric motor power of 750 W; battery must conform to specific safety standards; rider/driver must follow existing vehicle code (citations start at $100 and increase in multiples—confiscation is allowed). The municipal code specifically disallows claims of poor infrastructure repair (potholes/crevices in roadway) for accident/damage. Ride at your Risk! The article about poor infrastructure in the US is interesting in that maintenance of infrastructure has puzzling qualities about it. A group of people get together and fund the construction of something that likely will outlast the builders. Their kids or grandkids then have to fix it or maintain it. They may have quite different interests or economics. Also, the technology used to build in the first place may be difficult to repair. I sometimes think that when something gets built it should be given an endowment. If you put a million dollars into a fund for a bridge then in 100 years that may become about a billion dollars and that would be enough to make substantial repairs if not replace it. The flaw in this idea is that if you set aside that much money in a public fund some grifter will come along and steal it. Something a little similar exists for certajn bridges in the UK. A college contemporary is a trustee of one of these foundations. Rochester (Kent) and Southwark (London) bridges also have them. The trustees were granted powers by Parliament like sui generis corporations, usually including the power of tolling. They also owned land, either adjacent or further away. And they had powers of investment. A well run bridge can cover its repair and maintenance costs and generate quite a surplus. Some of these foundations give out substantial charitable sums from their surplus. https://www.citybridgefoundation.org.uk/what-we-do/bridges https://rbt.org.uk re: the war on cash via German HINTERGRUND magazine The gradual abolition of cash The following text is an excerpt from the Spiegel bestseller “War on Cash” by Hakon von Holst.

The article in the NYT on the ‘Democrat Autopsy’ mentions that “producing a tough-minded public review of a national electoral defeat would be a politically delicate exercise under any circumstance, given the need to find fault with the work and judgment of important party leaders and strategists.” The article then goes on to completely exclude any mention of the Gaza Genocide, which the NYT has invisibilized… imagine that!

Title: Inside the 'Gen Z stare' and why it's dividing generations

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Dell employees are not OK. Every year, the company conducts an engagement survey for its workers, called "Tell Dell." One metric of employee satisfaction has dropped by 50% in two years amid layoffs and its push to get workers back in the office. On the agenda today: But first: Unpacking the new generational debate. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Millennials gave us skinny jeans and avocado toast. Gen Z? They've mastered the stare. Yes, that stare — the blank, expressionless look from the younger generation that's been lighting up the internet lately. Is it real? A post-pandemic side effect? A silent cry for help? Or is it just how Gen Z vibes? At Business Insider, we dove headfirst into the phenomenon, decoding the psychology, exploring what it means for careers, and examining how it plays out in the workplace. What is it? As more of Gen Z enters the workforce, some millennials say younger workers greet customers and colleagues with wide eyes, blank expressions, and pregnant pauses. Most of the debate hinges on Gen Zers working customer service roles, like hostessing at restaurants or taking orders at coffee shops. While this could be a sign of workplace awkwardness or underdeveloped soft skills, others are pushing back and saying the trend's blame is misplaced. Is it real? Our resident Gen Zer Amanda Yen says, "It's ironic that millennials are diagnosing their Gen Z counterparts in much the same way boomers diagnosed and pathologized them. Millennials, are you sure you're not just becoming your parents?" The value of silence. BI's Katie Notopoulos, an older millennial, said if you're on the receiving end of the "Gen-Z stare," maybe you're the problem. "One thing I learned is that sometimes silence is the best way to handle a situation. In other words, you might say: Give 'em the 'Gen Z stare.' If someone keeps pushing, eventually you have to leave some silence hanging in the air — no more room for them to negotiate." Just don't get Katie started on how Gen Zers answer the phone! Is screen time to blame? Psychologists and generational experts are weighing in, saying the phenomenon could have more to do with natural growing pains on a first job. There are also factors unique to Gen Z's upbringing, including how the generation has grown up in front of screens. One professor told BI that it's naive to underestimate the impact that COVID-19 shutdowns and online learning could have had on young people's development. What do Gen Zers think? We asked several young people between the ages of 17 and 27 what they thought about the debate. A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the whole thing is overblown. A 20-year-old from the Bay Area said she sees it all the time. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it. We asked our readers if they had experienced the "Gen Z stare." The results are in, and spoiler — a majority of you have! It's been six months since Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency slashed the federal workforce in an effort to "streamline the Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency." After months of being in limbo, a recent Supreme Court ruling allowed the stalled firings to proceed. In a series of conversations with BI, six former government employees spoke about their career shifts, what life is like outside government work, and more. "I'll always be known as that." Also read: The ability to return a purchased item has become a core part of the shopping experience. Retailers say consumers are taking advantage of returns — and a recent report from Appriss Retail and Deloitte found it's costing businesses $103 billion a year. Some consumers are committing outright fraud by shipping back empty boxes or claiming a package never arrived. Others are sending back items after months of use. The culprits are often everyday consumers, and they don't feel bad. A nation of retail fraudsters. Also read: Elite millennials like Dan Schweber are quitting corporate America in favor of search funds: the practice of buying and running small businesses, also known as "mini private equity." Plenty of these unglamorous small businesses — like carwashes, plumbing, or snowplowing — are owned by boomers looking to retire. That makes them prime for millennial MBAs like Schweber, who can, in some cases, turn them into multimillion-dollar companies. Here's how they do it. You've probably heard of the viral concert "kiss cam" video that appeared to show Astronomer CEO Andy Byron embracing the company's head of HR Kristin Cabot, then springing apart once they realize they're on camera. The reaction prompted Coldplay's Chris Martin to comment, "Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy." A potential office affair is good gossip, but BI's Katie Notopoulos thinks there's something more troubling here: the knee-jerk reaction to identify the people in the video. Why she regrets seeing that video. This week's quote: "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder." — A millennial who was paid to catch people secretly working multiple jobs but ended up joining them.

Title: Starbucks corporate workers protest the latest RTO mandate: 'This is the wrong direction. Please stop.'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-workers-protest-rto-mandate-company-culture-brian-niccol-2025-7

Employees at Starbucks' corporate headquarters who are unhappy about CEO Brian Niccol's strict return-to-office mandate are making their displeasure known. On Friday, a flyer created by "Partners for the Preservation of Starbucks Culture, Mission, and Values" was taped inside an elevator at the corporate offices in Seattle. Featuring two photos of Niccol and a list of grievances, the flyer calls out Niccol's leadership, recent cost-cutting bonuses for executives, the RTO order, and broader changes in the work environment, a photo shows. "Getting 'Back to Starbucks' isn't just about comfy chairs. It's about our Culture, Values, Mission, and how we treat people and the environment," it reads. "This is the wrong direction. Please stop." It appeared several days after Niccol sent a firm message to the company's corporate workers on Monday: Come back to the office four days a week or leave. Some "people leaders" who manage teams had their remote status eliminated, requiring them to relocate to Seattle or Toronto. According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, Starbucks offered voluntary buyout packages of between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on title, for those who would rather leave the company. Four Starbucks corporate employees told BI they were worried the strict return-to-office mandate contributed to an erosion of the company's "partner first" culture. A Starbucks spokesperson told BI the return-to-office mandate was about enhancing the company's culture, not further reducing head count. Starbucks formally laid off 1,100 corporate workers in February. "I think for those of us who have been around for a while, we see a culture shift happening in the organization where our public face doesn't necessarily match our private face anymore," one Starbucks veteran, who has worked for the company for nearly 20 years, told BI. The latest RTO notices surprised the corporate Starbucks workers who spoke with BI and prompted others to immediately begin looking for new roles and sharing their concerns on social media. "As Starbucks chooses to require all people-leaders to relocate to Seattle, I am placed in a position where I must consider exploring other opportunities and would appreciate your support," Kristina Lawson, a Starbucks program manager who has been with the company for more than 18 years, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. Lawson didn't respond to a request for comment. Corporate America is in the middle of a return-to-office showdown. BI has reported that major companies, from Amazon to Zoom, have implemented various RTO mandates. Each company's approach has been different, with some incentivizing employees to work in-office with perks such as raises, and others threatening to fire workers if they don't comply. BI's Aki Ito reported in May that some suspected strict RTO mandates were actually a way to get employees to quit — and they may be right, because voluntary resignations remove the company's need to pay severance or health insurance, resulting in a less expensive reduction in force than traditional layoffs. "We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together," Niccol said in a statement to BI. "We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster." Niccol's statement continued: "We're driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values. We know we're asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone." Niccol, who joined the company from Chipotle last September, has been leading the coffee giant through a "Back to Starbucks" revitalization initiative. He's attempting to reverse slumping sales, improve the customer experience, and address problems with its mobile ordering system and long wait times. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Starbucks is offering top executives up to $6 million in stock bonuses if the company meets its cost-reduction goals by the end of fiscal 2027. One Starbucks employee in Seattle who has worked in corporate operations for the company for more than seven years told BI that several other anonymous flyers had been posted around the building with complaints about changes Niccol was promoting and that some employees had voiced concern in open Slack channels. While they won't be personally affected by the RTO order, the employee said they were worried about how the company would operate if some of the most passionate partners decide to leave. "There are some remote partners that have niche knowledge and skills that will leave massive Kool-Aid Man-sized holes in the wall if they decide to take the exit payment," the employee said.

Title: As Newsom Campaigns, California Has Highest Unemployment Rate in U.S.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already started his 2028 presidential campaign — but his state has the highest unemployment rate in the United States. As Breitbart News reported earlier this month, Newsom left California in the midst of over a dozen wildfires to travel to rural South Carolina, testing the waters for a presidential run in the state Democrats have promoted to the first in the list of primary contests. However, while Newsom has led Democrats in criticizing President Donald Trump and other Republicans, his performance in office is a drag on his prospects. Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation: California’s unemployment rate rose slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, to 5.4% in June, tying Nevada for the highest rate in the U.S., according to new federal data released Friday. The state lost a net 6,100 jobs, including 9,900 layoffs in business and professional services. Health care and government saw job gains, but other sectors all shrunk. … California’s May jobs gains were also revised downwards to a 11,700 increase, down 6,000 jobs compared to a preliminary estimate of 17,700. 5.4% is not historically high; it is below the 5.5% that economists once believed was the “Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment” (NAIRU), the lowest rate possible before inflation would begin to rise. Still, it points to the fact that the Golden State is underperforming relative to the rest of the country, which — even in deep-blue jurisdictions — has tended to avoid some of California’s more extreme left-wing policies.

Title: What Analysts Think of Intel Stock Ahead of Earnings

Intel is scheduled to report second-quarter results after Thursday's close, with analysts parked in neutral amid questions surrounding what's next for the chip maker's foundry. All 11 analysts covering Intel (INTC) tracked by Visible Alpha have "hold" ratings for the stock. Their consensus price target near $23 would suggest little change from Thursday's intraday level just over $23. Intel's foundry division is a focus of investor attention. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan reportedly is considering a shift in the manufacturer's contract chipmaking business that could lead to Intel writing off hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars' worth of chipmaking technology as a loss. A change could move the division to change its manufacturing process in a bid to win big customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). UBS analysts said recently that the move "may represent the first step in a hard pivot away from foundry and towards the product business, which we think may prove strategically sound but operationally challenging." "We have indicated 'light' at the end of the tunnel, but it is a long tunnel and we remain on the sidelines," UBS said. UBS raised its price target to $25 from $21. Wedbush, meanwhile, maintained a price target of $19, while HSBC kept a target of $22. All three analysts have neutral ratings for Intel stock.Wall Street on average expects Intel to report quarterly revenue of $11.93 billion, down 7% year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $76.3 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $83 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the foundry division is expected to have fallen 7% to $3.98 billion. Intel has reportedly started laying off thousands of workers in Oregon as part of previously announced cuts under its restructuring plan. UPDATE—July 24, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Title: The Oligarchs' Coup Against the Free Press Is Happening Now
URL: https://www.thedissident.news/the-oligarchs-coup-against-the-free-press-is-happening-now/
Time Published: 2025-07-20T05:47:01Z

The American information space is not merely changing; it is undergoing a hostile takeover. It is a deliberate, coordinated campaign by a new class of oligarchs out of Silicon Valley that includes Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg acting in concert with a Trump-led authoritarian political project. Their goal is singular: to systematically dismantle the free press and rebuild it as a network of propaganda organs designed to protect and uphold the regime and the oligarchs. The gutting of The Washington Post is not a separate event from the algorithmic manipulation of X. The defunding of PBS is not disconnected from the weaponization of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These are interconnected fronts in a single, undeclared war on the very concept of an informed public. To understand the nature of this war you must turn to Hannah Arendt and her concept of “a fool’s freedom.”[1] The modern deprivation of rights comes not from the overt censorship of opinion, but from the construction of an ecosystem where that opinion is rendered impotent. It is the freedom to speak into the abyss. What good is the right to an opinion if that opinion can never gain traction, never reach a critical mass, and therefore never matter? The oligarchs’ total control over the means of distribution (the algorithms of Google, Tiktok, Meta, and X) is the silent, brutally effective mechanism for enforcing this new, more insidious form of authoritarianism. The first front in this war is the capture and neutering of the legacy press from within. The billionaire owners of media, acting more as a political ideologue than a business custodian, have seized direct control of the nation’s most storied newsrooms. The narrative of financial necessity has become the perfect camouflage for an ideological purge. The language of “reinvention” and “transformation” is a smokescreen, obscuring a systematic effort to install loyalists, enforce regime-friendly editorial lines, and drive out any journalist who dares to uphold the quaint notion of holding power to account. This is a coordinated purge executed by a new class of authoritarian oligarchs who see a free press not as a pillar of democracy, but as an obstacle to their regime. The Press Has Been Systematically Dismantled by the Highest Bidder The Washington Post’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” now reads like a grim epitaph carved on its own tombstone. Democracy died and Jeff Bezos helped take it out back to shoot it and bury it for good measure. When Jeff Bezos bought the paper, many in the media hoped for a savior. Instead, it got an executioner and undertaker. The veneer of benevolent, hands-off ownership fell away as the prospect of a second Trump administration loomed, and the Amazon kingpin began his work: systematically gutting the institution and bending it to his will. The purge that followed was brutal. Under the watch of CEO Will Lewis, a political hatchet man brought over from the Murdoch empire, a wave of talent was driven out. Veterans with decades of experience were shown the door. A Pulitzer-winning cartoonist was silenced for satirizing the new power structure. Those who weren't fired were encouraged to take buyouts, fleeing a newsroom consumed by a crisis of purpose. What remains is a hollowed-out shell, a once-great institution forced into dutiful submission. On the West Coast, the same playbook is running its course at the Los Angeles Times. Billionaire owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has presided over a slow-motion demolition, using the cudgel of financial crisis to carry out a political hit. Under the cover of staggering financial losses that have only mounted under his ownership, Soon-Shiong has unleashed a relentless series of layoffs, gutting over 20% of the newsroom and leaving it, in the words of its own union, “a shadow of its former self.”[2] But the carnage isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about silencing a powerful, critical voice. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong personally intervened to kill a presidential endorsement that would have angered Trump. He has since been explicit about his goal of imposing a “more balanced ideological approach,” and to do so, he has brought in Republican operatives, including the former head of a pro-Trump PAC, to help reshape the paper’s editorial board. The strategy is clear: starve the newsroom, then restaff it with loyalists. The capture of individual newspapers is only phase one. The next is to weaken any remaining progressive outposts, leaving them vulnerable. MSNBC, long a bastion of liberal politics under its headline star, Rachel Maddow, is being led to the slaughter. Parent company Comcast is spinning the network off, severing it from the newsroom of NBC News and the broader protection of NBCUniversal. This isn't a business decision; it’s an abandonment. MSNBC is being left on the side of the road, an isolated and weakened target ripe for a takeover. The "jokes" by Elon Musk about buying the network and firing its stars are not jokes at all. They are the vultures circling, a public declaration of intent from the oligarch class. And their ambition doesn’t stop at the news. It extends to the very fabric of culture. The persistent rumors that Jeff Bezos plans to acquire Condé Nast (Vogue, Wired, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair) as a wedding gift for his wife, Lauren Sanchez, reveals the endgame.[3] This is the terminal stage of oligarchic conquest where the power to shape global culture is reduced to a personal trinket. It is the ultimate expression of contempt for the public sphere, a world where the means of mass communication become just another luxury good, molded to the whims of our new feudal lords. The Algorithmic Coup: Seizing the Means of Reality Production While the oligarchs have been conducting a hostile takeover of legacy media, they have also been slowly amping up their control of the algorithms that curate reality itself to the vast majority of the population. It’s a hostile takeover of the digital public square by a handful of oligarchs acting in service to an authoritarian regime. The "For You" page and the News Feed have been weaponized, turned from sorting tools into active instruments of political power, used to manufacture consent and crush dissent on a scale that makes old-world propaganda look primitive. Elon Musk’s seizure of Twitter and its rebranding as X is the playbook’s most brazen chapter. Under the fraudulent banner of “free speech absolutism,” he gutted the platform and began the real work: transforming a global communication tool into his personal propaganda megaphone. His philosophy of “Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom of Reach” was a lie from the start, a pretext for a system where his allies are amplified and his critics are shadow banned into oblivion. After his endorsement of Donald Trump, the political agenda became undeniable. Researchers identified a "structural break" in the algorithm, a point where the code was rewritten to systematically favor Republican accounts.[4] The system is now so blatantly biased that it has triggered investigations by the European Commission. The final piece of this ideological propaganda project is Grok, his AI chatbot that called itself “MechaHitler” just last week is being aligned to avoid being "woke," creating a model that reflects his own paranoid worldview back at him.[5] While Musk’s takeover was a frontal assault, Mark Zuckerberg’s at Meta is a strategic surrender. Facing the threat of a vengeful Trump administration, Zuckerberg has preemptively neutered his platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to appease the ascendant right. This is not principle; it is appeasement from a man who was seemingly birthed without a spine or personality of his own. In a sweeping act of capitulation dressed in gaudy chains and baggy t-shirts, Zuckerberg dismantled Meta's third-party fact-checking program, a system long despised by conservatives, and replacing it with a manipulated "Community Notes" model imported from Musk's X. He has opened the floodgates for inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and gender, especially transgender people, ensuring the regime's talking points will flow freely. Zuckerberg has seen which way the wind is blowing and is ensuring his platforms will serve as a hospitable environment for the new power. The final and biggest prize in this digital war is TikTok, the dominant cultural artery for an entire generation. The forced sale of the platform from its Chinese parent company, justified under the pretext of "national security," is a blatant lie. The true objective is not to protect American data, which could be done by passing meaningful data protections, but rather, to seize control of the world's most powerful algorithm for influencing youth culture.[6] The leading proposed buyer is a consortium led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of Donald Trump's most powerful and loyal allies in Silicon Valley and whose son, David Ellison, is currently finalizing his own takeover of Paramount and plans on repurposing CBS News into a propaganda organ by placing Bari Weiss in charge.[7] Placing TikTok in the hands of a regime loyalist is the strategic masterstroke. It would give them direct control over the primary information channel for a generation that has been historically resistant to their message. It is the power to decide what trends, what is cool, and what is thinkable. The forced sale of TikTok is nothing less than a state-orchestrated hostile takeover of the youth's collective consciousness. The State’s Assault on Truth The oligarchs' private capture of the media is but one arm of a pincer movement. The other is a direct, state led assault by the Trump administration and its allies on any remaining sources of independent information. This demonstrates a core tenet of modern authoritarianism: there is no distinction between the state and the party. All levers of government, from regulatory agencies to the justice system and the federal budget are seen not as instruments of public service, but rather as legitimate weapons to be used to reward allies and punish enemies. From this perspective, these actions are not an abuse of the system; they are the system's intended purpose. The campaign to destroy public broadcasting in America is a long-term, strategic priority for the Trump movement, laid bare in the pages of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's comprehensive playbook for a second Trump term. The plan is not merely to reform public media but to annihilate it. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the complete defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides essential funding for NPR and PBS stations across the country. The blueprint goes further, advocating for stripping these outlets of their non-commercial educational status and even moving them off their desirable FM radio frequencies to make way for religious and Christian nationalist broadcasting. The justification is that public media is a "liberal disinformation machine" that must be dismantled.[8] The rescission package expected to pass Congress this week will zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and claw back $1.1 billion in funding already allocated to the CPB.[9] This effort to starve public media would be devastating, particularly for rural and underserved communities that rely on these stations as their primary source of local news and emergency information, effectively creating vast "news deserts" across the country. That’s entirely the point. They need to ensure that those living in rural areas become hopelessly dependent on propaganda in order to access even basic information about the world around them. The final weapon in the state's arsenal is the legal and regulatory system itself, which is being wielded to intimidate, extort, and co-opt media organizations into submission. The Trump administration is increasingly using every aspect of government to intimidate and coerce media organizations into yielding to its narrative. The most chilling precedent is the $16 million settlement paid by Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, to end a frivolous lawsuit brought by Donald Trump.[10] Paramount has an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media pending before the Trump-controlled FCC. The FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, had already reopened a dubious "news distortion" investigation into the very same interview, placing the merger in jeopardy. Facing this immense pressure, Paramount capitulated. This case is part of a broader pattern of using various federal agencies as a sword of Damocles. Trump and his appointees have repeatedly threatened to use the power of the FCC and FTC to punish their perceived enemies. This includes threats to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like NBC and ABC for "Country Threatening Treason," launching politically motivated investigations into news outlets, and promising to bring these supposedly independent agencies under direct presidential authority. This strategy of direct state coercion creates a pervasive climate of fear, encouraging self-censorship and ensuring that media owners think twice before publishing anything that might anger the regime. The Fool's Freedom The sum total of these actions by the oligarchs to capture legacy media, manipulate the algorithmic control of digital platforms, and use the state to assault any remaining independent voices has created a terrifyingly effective new model of information control. It is a system that maintains the outward appearance of a free and diverse media landscape. We still have websites to browse, podcasts to download, and newsletters to subscribe to. Many will even be harshly critical of the oligarchs and the Trump administration. We still possess, in the narrowest legal sense, the right to an opinion. But this is a fool’s freedom. As Hannah Arendt noted, the most profound deprivation of rights occurs not when you are forbidden to have an opinion, but when your opinion is rendered meaningless. The oligarchs’ control over the critical infrastructure of information distribution is the ultimate choke point. They are the gatekeepers of relevance, the silent arbiters of what is seen and what is buried, what is amplified and what is ignored. This new reality destroys the very possibility of public accountability. An independent journalist can break a world-changing story, a citizen can voice powerful dissent, but if these are algorithmically suppressed, they cannot reach a critical mass. They cannot generate public outrage. They cannot hold power to account. This is speech without consequence, opinion without impact. Arendt’s concept of “action,” meaning the speech and deeds through which we appear to one another and create a shared public world, is rendered impossible. We are witnessing the construction of a sophisticated, 21st-century propaganda state. It is a state that doesn’t need to burn books when it can simply change the algorithm. It maintains the illusion of choice while ensuring, through a seamless integration of private ownership, state intimidation, and algorithmic control, that only one narrative prevails. The choice we are left with is not between different news sources, but between different flavors of state and oligarch approved information. This is the grim reality of the fool’s freedom in which we now live. Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (Expanded edition. ed. 2025) at p. 315. (“The same is true even to an ironical extent with regard to the right of freedom which is sometimes considered to be the very essence of human rights. There is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have more freedom of movement than a lawfully imprisoned criminal or that they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a totalitarian country. But neither physical safety—being fed by some state or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool’s freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow. These last points are crucial. The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of choice, or when one is placed in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion.”) ↩︎ Farley Elliott, ‘Devastated’: New Layoffs Hit California’s Biggest Newspaper, SFGATE (May 2, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/la-times-layoffs-latest-20307200.php. ↩︎ Jeff Bezos Rumored To Buy Vogue as Wedding Gift to Lauren Sanchez, ‘Source’ Claims, Yahoo Entertainment (Jul. 7, 2025), https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/jeff-bezos-rumored-buy-vogue-120000915.html. ↩︎ Wes Davis, A Study Found That X’s Algorithm Now Loves Two Things: Republicans and Elon Musk, The Verge (Nov. 17, 2024), https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change. ↩︎ Alejandra Caraballo, The Algorithmic Unmasking: How Grok’s “MechaHitler” Turn Revealed the Inevitable Collapse of “Anti-Woke” AI, The Dissident (Jul. 9, 2025), https://www.thedissident.news/the-algorithmic-unmasking-how-groks-mechahitler-turn-revealed-the-inevitable-collapse-of-anti-woke-ai/. ↩︎ Mike Masnick, Once More With Feeling: Banning TikTok Is Unconstitutional & Won’t Do Shit To Deal With Any Actual Threats, Techdirt (Mar. 14, 2024), https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/14/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-is-unconstitutional-wont-do-shit-to-deal-with-any-actual-threats/. ↩︎ Brian Stelter, CBS’ Likely New Owner Is in Talks with Bari Weiss to Buy The Free Press | CNN Business, CNN (Jul. 11, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/media/free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-paramount. ↩︎ Project 2025: What a Second Trump Term Could Mean for Media and Technology Policies, Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/ (last visited Jul. 17, 2025). ↩︎ Scott Neuman, Senate Approves Cuts to NPR, PBS and Foreign Aid Programs, NPR, Jul. 17, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote. ↩︎ Benjamin Mullin Michael M.
