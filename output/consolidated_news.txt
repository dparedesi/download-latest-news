Title: US stocks edge higher as earnings reports, economic updates pour in
URL: https://www.wftv.com/news/business/asian-shares-sink/4HSPD2PJDI3FBBV6LXINKNDEXI/

WFTV Now NEW YORK — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies. The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day's dip. Much of the market's push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market. Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald's rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street's latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts' forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That's down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin ‘bows head in shame’ after admitting to 50x scaling bottleneck
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-bows-head-in-shame-after-admitting-to-50x-scaling-bottleneck/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T03:00:14Z

Well, it would seem that the network can’t catch a break! Modexp inefficiency and $135.7M ETF outflows mean Ethereum is getting hit from both sides. If demand doesn’t return fast, $3.3K-$3.35K will become a realistic downside target. Ethereum [ETH] is facing a double hit this week, and the timing could not be worse! Co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted in an X post that the current modexp precompile is hurting ZK-proof efficiency. He added that it’s slowing down a feature that is meant to drive ETH’s next big scaling upgrade. Source: X At the same time, institutions are quietly walking out the door – ETH ETFs saw $135.7M in net outflows, with BlackRock alone unloading $81.7M. If both the tech layer and the capital layer turn against ETH in the same week, is the floor about to give way? According to Buterin, modexp can be “50x worse than average blocks” for ZK-EVM proving. This is confirmation that the inefficiency is now too big to ignore. In his own words, he even said he “bows his head in shame” for inventing it. Source: X The community response was simple – This is a waste of engineering time, and fixing modexp matters more than squeezing tiny efficiency gains elsewhere. As one user put it, “Makes sense. The opportunity cost of optimizing obscure opcodes is huge compared to improving core scalability layers.” This matters because if ZK-proving stays slow, ETH scaling stalls. And, that risk is suddenly front and center. Yesterday alone, ETH ETFs saw $135.7 million in outflows, with BlackRock dumping $81.7 million on its own. That’s institutional capital actively reducing exposure. Source: X And, the scale matters here – This is one of ETH’s sharpest single-day outflow clusters since launch. If big allocators continue to pull liquidity at this pace, Ethereum will struggle to find a floor. This turns the modexp debate into a capital flight problem. At press time, Ethereum’s price was trading near $3,480 after a heavy two-day sell-off candle cluster that erased most of last week’s bounce. The RSI suggested that momentum has been weak, but not yet fully oversold. The OBV continued to slide lower too. So, volume has been flowing out, not in. Source: TradingView Structurally, this means ETH has failed to defend its short-term support. Unless demand returns quickly, there’s a clear risk of a deeper fall (potentially toward the $3.3K-$3.35K pocket), before any real upside attempt could form.

Title: IBM to layoff thousands of employees before end of year
URL: https://www.newsweek.com/ibm-layoff-thousands-employees-before-end-year-10992649
Time Published: 2025-11-05T01:08:33Z

Published Nov 04, 2025 at 05:41 PM EST Reporter, Consumer & Social Trends IBM announced Tuesday it would be laying off thousands of employees before the end of the year. The job losses will amount to a “low single-digit percentage” of the global workforce. For a 1 percent cut, that would mean the loss of 2,700 jobs. Many companies have implemented layoffs as a way to boost profits and increase efficiency as they head into new financial quarters. Meta, for instance, announced it plans to cut roughly 600 roles from its AI team as business priorities shift. While IBM had 270,000 global workers at the end of 2025, a single-digit percentage layoff would mean thousands of employees would no longer have jobs at the end of the year. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” a company spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.” Many tech companies have reduced their employee headcounts, focusing on artificial intelligence tools to boost productivity even with fewer workers. In October, Amazon announced layoffs for 14,000 corporate employees, and Meta will be letting 600 workers in its AI unit go. IBM previously reported a 10 percent jump in revenue from software last month, but the larger sector is facing uncertainty from several directions, experts say. “The current environment is filled with uncertainty, and many companies may feel like this is the perfect opportunity to get rid of what some believe to be pandemic bloat,” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek. “Many companies were forced to keep staff for longer than they had hoped and perhaps this would allow them to thin their workforce.” Newsweek reached out to IBM for comment via email. Matt Bruno, chief revenue officer at Laivly, told Newsweek: “For the past few years, the industry’s been focused on building large, experimental AI teams. Now the emphasis is shifting to precision and measurable impact. We’ve seen that same evolution on the business side, especially in contact centers, where companies are moving from pilots to embedding AI directly into workflows that help agents make better decisions and improve performance. It’s fascinating to see that same focus on outcomes now extending to the model makers themselves.” Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “While some will lay the blame on AI for these cuts, it’s difficult to say based on the initial announcement if that’s in fact the case. The workforce in the United States for IBM actually remains flat year-over-year despite the cuts. Still, this is the latest in a series of major corporate job reductions that will further stoke fears of how technological advancements are going to lead to more job losses.” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: “The tech industry is accelerating toward AI adoption, and with that comes a belief in new efficiencies that allow companies to do more with less. Some divisions are being downsized because they rely on older, outdated technologies that no longer fit the direction the industry is heading. Others are being restructured or folded into different parts of the company.” Business experts say workers should expect a continuing spree of layoff announcements as we near the end of the year. “As we move toward the end of the year, expect more layoff announcements,” Thompson said. “Year-end is traditionally when companies evaluate performance, tighten operations, and adjust forecasts for the year ahead.” © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC

Title: The People Who Will Determine Whether Musk Becomes a Trillionaire
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/11/elon-musk-trillionaire-tesla/684822/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T00:56:00Z

This week’s Tesla shareholder vote could give the world’s richest man more money and more control. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Elon Musk wants to be anointed the world’s first trillionaire—but he swears it’s not about the money. Over the past few weeks, the Tesla CEO has been demanding greater power over the electric-vehicle manufacturer that he has led for almost two decades. Specifically, he is asking for another 12 percent of the company—a stake currently worth roughly $190 billion. If shareholders vote for it, and if Musk meets the board’s goals for drastically increasing the company’s value, the total value of his personal stake will shoot up to $1 trillion. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will finish voting on whether to give him both more money and more control over the company’s governance—or to give him neither. The compensation package is partly a reflection of Tesla’s changing priorities. The company’s “Master Plan IV,” released in September, “makes no mention of any new electric cars in the works,” Patrick George recently wrote in The Atlantic. “It is instead a technocratic fever dream, predicting a future in which humanoid robots made by Tesla free us from mundane tasks and create a utopia of ‘sustainable abundance.’” Tesla’s board has said that the compensation package will help motivate Musk to pursue these innovations; in the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, robots—not money—were at the heart of Musk’s argument for more shares. “If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?” he asked. As the world’s richest man and the CEO of several companies, Musk exerts an enormous amount of influence over many people’s lives, but Tesla’s structure does include some checks on that power. Tesla is, on paper, overseen by those who actually own the company—which isn’t always the case at other public companies. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, owns about 13 percent of Meta, but as of last year, he controls 61 percent of the total voting power, thanks to a special class of stock that grants him outsize sway over corporate governance. This system is not a democratic representation of all shareholders’ views, but it is nevertheless popular among today’s tech companies. Snap Inc. (the parent company of Snapchat) is perhaps the most extreme example; its two co-founders control more than 99 percent of the vote. The fact that a vote against Tesla’s pay package is even technically possible is a reflection of a not-so-monopolized voting structure. Companies often have valid reasons for deciding to centralize so much control in the hands of a few individuals (dissenters can make it hard for boardrooms to move quickly on decisions, and outside interests can dilute a founder’s vision, to name two). But that centralization can also lead to something of a shareholder monarchy. Although Tesla is already consolidated around Musk, he still doesn’t own a majority of the company. If shareholders were to reject his pay package, they’d be reminding the board that, for now, they still have ultimate say over how the company is run. Analysts generally believe that the compensation package will be accepted, because top Tesla shareholders have been content to follow Musk’s lead in the past. The company’s structure should ideally enable a multiplicity of dissenting voices—but more often, shareholders are simply willing to go with the board’s recommendations. This time, however, there has been early and forceful pushback. Some shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the bank behind the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, have come out against the plan on the grounds that $1 trillion is simply too much money for a single CEO. Prominent public figures have weighed in too: “We’re in big trouble,” Pope Leo XIV said of Musk’s possibly becoming a trillionaire. But in the world of corporate governance, there are forces far more influential than the pope. Among them are the proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, which do market research and advise fund providers such as BlackRock and Vanguard on how to vote their shares. The people invested in BlackRock’s and Vanguard’s funds aren’t all corporate bigwigs; some of them are ordinary people, with pensions and IRA accounts. Most of them won’t vote at Tesla’s shareholder meeting, but BlackRock and Vanguard certainly will. ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended voting against Musk’s pay package, as they’ve done repeatedly in recent years—Musk responded by calling the companies “corporate terrorists” during last month’s earnings call—although what BlackRock and Vanguard will decide is still unclear. Tesla leadership has been mounting a steady campaign to undermine any dissent; a slick website, VoteTesla.com, lays out why voters should approve the pay package. But now the board appears to be scrambling. The chair, Robyn Denholm, who usually eschews public appearances, has been on something of a media tour over the past few weeks, defending the plan. For the board, this vote is existential. As early as last year, Musk was heavily implying that he would leave the company if he couldn’t have that 25 percent stake. If he exits, Tesla’s stock will almost certainly tank. Tesla’s board of nine, which includes Musk’s brother, seems to trust him completely. (After rejecting a previously proposed pay package, a Delaware court said that certain board members were not independent, citing concerns about undisclosed “connections between the members of the Compensation Committee and Musk”; Tesla is appealing the decision.) Whether shareholders outside Musk’s inner circle still maintain that trust is a question that will be answered later this week. Musk said in the earnings call that he wants just enough voting control to retain a “strong influence.” The conflict over his pay package is a reminder that influence shouldn’t be taken for granted.

AMD stock crashed 3.7% to $250.05 despite posting record Q3 2025 earnings. The chipmaker reported $9.25 billion in revenue, up 36% year-over-year, and $1.20 EPS, beating forecasts. Strong AI chip demand and new deals with OpenAI and Oracle pushed data center revenue to $4.3 billion. Yet, investors booked profits after massive gains this year. AMD’s $406 billion market cap and high 150.63 P/E ratio reflect steep valuation worries. Analysts still see rack-scale AI systems as AMD’s 2026 growth catalyst.

Title: Optimizing nested JSON array processing using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map

Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:12:17Z

AWS Blogs When you’re working with large datasets, you’ve likely encountered the challenge of processing complex JSON structures in your automated workflows. You need to preprocess arrays within nested JSON objects before you can run parallel processing on them. Extracting data used to require custom code and extra processing steps, delaying you from building your core application logic. With AWS Step Functions Distributed Map, you can process large datasets with concurrent iterations of workflow steps across data entries. Using the enhanced ItemsPointer feature of Distributed Maps, you can extract array data directly from JSON objects stored in Amazon S3. Alternatively, for JSON object as state input, you can use Items (JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath). With this enhancement you can point directly to arrays nested within JSON structures, eliminating the need for custom preprocessing of your data. With ItemsPointer, Items, and ItemsPath you can select the nested array data and simplify your workflows. In this post, we explore how to optimize processing array data embedded within complex JSON structures using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. You’ll learn how to use ItemsPointer to reduce the complexity of your state machine definitions, create more flexible workflow designs, and streamline your data processing pipelines—all without writing additional transformation code or AWS Lambda functions. In this e-commerce use case example, you’ll build a sample application that demonstrates processing of product inventory data for an e-commerce application using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. The application receives a JSON file from an upstream application containing an array of product information. The Step Functions workflow reads the JSON file containing product data from an S3 bucket and iterates over the array to enrich each product data in the array. The following diagram presents the AWS Step Functions state machine. JSON array processing workflow The JSON array is processed using the following workflow: MaxConcurrency can be configured to specify the number of child workflow executions in a Distributed Map that can run in parallel. If not specified, then Step Functions doesn’t limit concurrency and runs 10,000 parallel child workflow executions. You can read a JSON file from a S3 bucket using ItemReader and its sub-fields. If the JSON file, from the S3 bucket, contains a nested object structure, you can select the specific node with your data set with an ItemsPointer. For example, the following input JSON file: The following JSONata-based workflow configuration extracts a nested list of products from productUpdates/items: For JSONPath-based workflow note that Arguments is replaced with Parameters: The ItemReader field is not needed when your dataset is JSON data from a previous step. ItemsPointer is only applicable when the input JSON objects read from an S3 bucket. If you are using JSON as state input to a Distributed Map, then you can use the ItemsPath (for JSONPath) or Items (for JSONata) field to specify a location in the input that points to JSON array or object used for iterations. To use Step Functions Distributed Map, verify you have: Run the following steps to deploy the Step Functions state machine. Enter the following details: The outputs from the sam deploy will be used in the subsequent steps. The state machine reads the input product-updates.json file and invokes a Lambda function to update the database for every product in the array after adding price and stock information. The execution metadata is also uploaded into the results bucket. Run the following steps to monitor and verify the test results. Wait until the status shows SUCCEEDED. To avoid costs, remove all resources you’ve created while following along with this post. Run the following command after replacing the <placeholder> variable to delete the resources you deployed for this post’s solution: In this post, you learned how to use Step Functions Distributed Map for extracting array data natively from JSON objects stored in a S3 bucket. By removing custom data extraction code, you can simplify the processing of your large-scale parallel workloads. With ItemsPointer you can extract array data within JSON files stored in a S3 bucket , and with Items(JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath), you can extract arrays from complex JSON state input, adding flexibility to your workflow designs. New input sources for Distributed Map are available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Step Functions is available. For a complete list of AWS Regions where Step Functions is available, see the AWS Region Table. To get started, you can use the Distributed Map mode today in the AWS Step Functions console.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Nov 05, 2025, 07:00 AM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 08:31 AM BENGALURU - IBM will cut roles this quarter, the company said on Nov 4, potentially impacting thousands of employees while it shifts focus towards its high-margin software segment, as Wall Street hones in on the company’s ability to benefit from artificial intelligence-linked cloud demand. “We routinely review our workforce… and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce.” A massive supplier of technology to businesses, IBM joins other companies including Amazon, Meta and Google that have made recent staffing cuts as they race to invest more in the AI boom. Many executives have predicted more efficiency gains as the technology assists workers with coding and other tasks. Under chief executive Arvind Krishna, IBM has doubled down on software as it looks to tap increased spending on cloud services through its “Red Hat” division, as businesses integrate AI technology. However, IBM in October recorded a slowdown in growth in the key cloud software segment, raising alarm bells among investors betting heavily on Big Blue’s ability to benefit more from booming cloud services demand. Its shares, which have risen over 35 per cent in 2025, were down close to 2 per cent on Nov 4. IBM employed about 270,000 workers as at the end of 2024. Some US workers may be affected by the job reductions, but employment in the country is anticipated to remain roughly the same year over year, IBM said.

Title: Burry’s New ‘Big Short’ on AI
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/burrys-new-big-short-on-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:00:30Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 4, 2025 The Big Short is one of my favorite movies (and books). It’s a powerful story of investors who bet against the housing bubble, persevered through adversity, and won big. The story focuses on Michael J. Burry, a small but successful hedge fund manager in California. In the movie, Burry is played by actor Christian Bale. There are others featured in The Big Short who bet against the housing market, but today we’re going to focus on Burry and his new AI short. First, however, some background is in order. Back around 2004-2005, Burry discovered that lenders were giving huge loans to borrowers with bad credit, and as a topper, many of these mortgages were teasers with adjustable rates. The first few years were artificially cheap, then payments would balloon. Burry dissected the data, and discovered a great way to bet against housing using credit default swaps (CDS) on mortgage bonds. Many of Burry’s hedge fund clients thought he was insane. Betting so much of the fund’s capital against housing seemed ludicrous. Burry was forced to restrict fund redemptions, so his investors had no choice but to ride along with him. When the bubble finally burst, Burry’s fund made a killing. After fees, his big short returned almost 500% to investors. Burry had beat the big banks at their own game. But be warned. This story has inspired countless traders to attempt their own big shorts, with mixed results. At best… Michael J. Burry is a reclusive fellow. He keeps a low profile, but occasionally resurfaces on X (Twitter). On X, Burry goes by the handle “Cassandra”. Cassandra was an ancient Trojan priestess dedicated to the god Apollo. She was cursed with the ability to predict the future, but never be believed. The last time Burry reappeared was in January of 2023, when he posted a simple message: Sell. Via ZeroHedge Since then, the market has soared 69% higher. Burry got burnt on that big short. Shortly after, Burry deleted all his X posts and deactivated his account. But now Cassandra has finally returned to X. Just as 13F SEC filings disclosed his hedge fund, Scion Capital, took big short positions on Palantir (PLTR) and NVIDIA (NVDA). As of September 30th (these filings have a delay), Burry’s hedge fund held puts worth $912 million in Palantir and $186 million in NVIDIA (notional). Burry has seemingly initiated a new ‘Big Short’ on AI. It isn’t surprising to me that Burry is betting big against Palantir. It might be the most overvalued large-cap stock I’ve ever seen. The chart shows just how unusual Palantir’s valuation is. To be clear, Palantir is growing fast and appears to have tech which nobody else does. But it still looks way overpriced. Its current price-to-sales ratio is an incredible 126x. The company is valued at $491 billion and only produced $3.9 billion of revenue over the past year. Even during the dotcom bubble, no large company ever reached such lofty heights. Burry followed up his big AI short disclosure with some charts showing how AI bubble spending is similar to the dotcom era: We should remember that these filings have a delay, so these were Scion’s positions as of September 30th. Since then both NVDA and PLTR have risen, which means that thus far, Burry’s bet is down. He could have sold out of these positions, or added to them. We don’t know. Attempting to nail the top on red-hot stocks like these is extremely difficult. Even when he made the housing bubble bet, Burry had to wait years for it to pay off. In the meantime, he had to pay significant premiums on the CDS (his short instrument). For a while, it looked like his housing bet might fail. But eventually the housing bubble did pop, and Burry came out way ahead. We’ll have to wait and see whether he’ll be proven correct with this latest AI short. It’s easy to see that certain AI stocks are overvalued. Timing the short, however, is the tricky part. Today Palantir is down almost 7% today after reporting earnings yesterday. Palantir CEO and co-founder Alex Karp isn’t happy about Burry’s short position, calling it “market manipulation”. He told CNBC the following this morning: “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird. The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats**t crazy. … I do think this behavior is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” Is this the beginning of the crash? Or just a correction after a parabolic move, and there’s more upside ahead? I’m not taking a bet either way, for now. My advice: don’t bet the house on an AI collapse. As Keynes famously said, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this story.

Title: Don’t Panic, But AI Stocks Are Suddenly Lurching Downward
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-stocks-lurching-downward
Time Published: 2025-11-04T21:50:24Z
Full Content:
By Victor Tangermann Published Nov 4, 2025 4:50 PM EST Investors are increasingly becoming concerned that AI companies may be grossly overvalued — and could struggle to justify their enormous hype by successfully ratcheting up profits. So it’s naturally alarming that shares of AI industry stalwarts, including Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon, fell sharply on Tuesday, following concerns over enormous valuations that have propped up the entire US economy for months now. AI chipmaker Nvidia’s shares dipped just shy of four percent, while competitor AMD’s slid just under three percent today. Software giant Palantir was hit hardest, dropping over nine percent, despite beating Wall Street expectations with its Q3 earnings. What all of these companies have in common is an enormous price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), CNBC reports, which measures a firm’s share price relative to its earnings per share. It’s often used to determine whether a company is over- or undervalued. In the case of Palantir, the company’s valuation is upwards of 200 times its forward earnings, suggesting investors could be starting to ask difficult questions about the firm’s ability to sufficiently boost its revenues. The sudden dip comes after months of investor euphoria. The S&P 500 index has risen over 20 percent over the last six months alone, only to decline just under two percent over the last five days, indicating growing concerns over AI hype that grew too much, too fast. Companies have been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into major AI infrastructure buildouts, despite revenues lagging far behind. “We haven’t really seen any major corrections or any real pressure on stocks since April,” Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene told CNBC. “Profits are good, but I think investors are starting to ask themselves, based on the pace of [capital expenditure] investments from some of these key Big Tech companies, ‘Are you going to see the profit growth over the next year to justify the levels of capex?'” Saglimbene argued that he “would fully expect that you’re going to see a little bit of some periods of pullback.” Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon also raised alarms, predicting a “ten to 20 percent drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.” Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the firm would increase its already enormous AI spending significantly this year — news that was met with investor skepticism. The company’s shares slid by more than 11 percent on Thursday and are down over 16 percent over the last five days. It’s a precarious moment, with experts warning that the AI boom cycle is propping up a weakening economy. The consequences of a sudden collapse could be enormous. Meanwhile, some are cashing in on the dipping shares. Most notably, investor Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame disclosed he had placed bets against Palantir and Nvidia this week. Burry famously predicted the US housing market bubble and the following crash in 2008. Whether he’s right about an impending correction remains to be seen. Palantir CEO Alex Karp, for one, is unsurprisingly skeptical of Burry’s bets. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC today. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats*** crazy.” More on the AI market: Meta Stock Plummets as Investors Horrified at How Much Zuckerberg Is Spending on Misfired AI I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: The tech industry came for Steam and whiffed so hard that it's had to admit that it didn't even really like making games in the first place

Amazon's New World wouldn't have to die if the company actually wanted to be an MMO developer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon didn't spin up its game development studios a decade ago just to be a regular game publisher: It wanted to take on Steam, but missed its shot by such a wide margin that we didn't even realize that's what it was trying to do. Now it seems to have at least partially moved on from that ambition, and one big consequence is the end of historical-fantasy MMO New World, which will cease to receive updates and eventually be put to rest. This week: Put off installing Arc Raiders, but was finally convinced to take the plunge by those cool leaping bug bots. What's maddening is that New World itself was not a failure. It was a beneficiary of the early pandemic boom in online gaming, hitting a wild Steam concurrents peak of 913,634 after it launched in 2021. The MMO settled into much lower numbers by early 2022, but was far from a flop, and got an expansion in 2023 and a console port in 2024. New World presumably hasn't been raking in microtransaction cash recently, but when so many MMOs never even make it out of development or blow up on the launch pad, it was at least something: a foothold in an extremely hard-to-break-into space that could be parlayed into more success in the future. But Amazon—at least at the executive level—was clearly never really interested in being an MMO developer. It wanted to own PC gaming, and that's not working out, so now it's turning its attention to bleak games like one where an "AI-powered" Snoop Dogg plays the part of Judge Judy. Google was faster to make its retreat from the same ambition, closing its in-house studio before it ever released a game after it became clear that Stadia was not going to become the next Steam anytime soon. Microsoft, however, still aspires to sit atop the PC gaming throne. It's releasing games on Steam again, but it's also betting big on Game Pass, and you're probably not imagining covetousness in Microsoft CEO Sataya Nadella's recent comment that "Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of [Windows] and done a very successful job of it." (Don't get me started on the term "Xbox PC," which is now appearing in my inbox weekly.) Maybe one day some pure-of-heart PC gamer actually will topple Gaben from his throne, but in the meantime, it's frustrating to watch the tech industry use game developers as a means to impossible ends, tossing them to the curb even when they do make popular games, because for the most part these companies don't actually want to make games, but to bask in recurring revenue. Well, sorry tech industry, but the period where you could take over PC gaming by making one killer app is over. The killer app was Counter-Strike. Even with all the might of Fortnite behind it, the best Epic Games could do was to spend a fortune promoting a modest Steam competitor, which has really been the most honest attempt to take it on. (And at least Epic didn't try to acquire the whole industry, instead throwing money at independent developers like Remedy to support its aims.) Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. What I love to see are game developers whose existence is justified just by making games that people want to buy, not by their role in a plan for PC gaming domination. It's mildly heartening that, at least from the outside, some of Microsoft's studios appear to be operating under that justification. In February, Obsidian outlined a plan to keep making RPGs for 100 years by not chasing unrealistic profit margins, and Double Fine is still making cool, niche games. But it's impossible to look at Microsoft's recent history of studio closures, layoffs, and unrealistic profit expectations and think that these legendary studios are safe from LinkedIn-brained executives who claim that the best way to innovate in gaming "is to have good margins." What happens if Game Pass isn't the future? Nothing good for Microsoft's studios, and the irony is that PC gaming itself is bigger than ever. Games like New World don't have to be abandoned if the companies that make them actually want to be in the business of making games. Let's hope that, unlike Amazon, some part of Microsoft still does.

The numbers are in — and it looks like artificial intelligence is coming for Gen Z jobs. US job postings for young adults aged 22 to 25 – the heart of the job-seeking segment of Generation Z – have plunged 13% since 2022 across AI-exposed industries, according to a recent Stanford University report. It also happens that 2022 is when ChatGPT was first launched – sparking an epic race across corporate America to find ways to use AI to increase efficiencies and otherwise revamp their operations. Major US employers – including Amazon, UPS and Target – have cut thousands of jobs this year as they ramp up automation efforts. On Tuesday, IBM said it will lay off about 1% of its workforce in the current quarter, or approximately 2,700 jobs. “It disproportionately hurts corporate America jobs, specifically around heavy data entry and what would be mundane tasks,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “I think Gen Z could be impacted more than others.” Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on artificial intelligence as US firms hope to beat China in the AI race and reap significant cost savings. The downside of those cost savings is layoffs – particularly hitting jobs like consultants, accounting, finance and entry-level roles that typically appeal to Gen Z graduates, Ives said. Roles that are seen as pathways for young workers in white-collar jobs are in “substantial” decline, the Stanford report warned. But AI will also lead to some job creation in roles like software engineering, development and manufacturing, he added. “AI is definitely playing a role in a tough job market, especially entry level jobs,” Ives told The Post. “I think companies won’t admit it, but it’s definitely playing a bigger role.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Tech firms have announced huge layoffs this year, though few have attributed the cuts to AI. Last week, Amazon launched a round of 14,000 job cuts in an effort to “reduce bureaucracy.” In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce – over the coming weeks, sources told Reuters. It plans to avoid hiring more than half a million jobs over the coming years by automating its warehouses with the latest robots, according to a New York Times report. Ultimately, the firm’s robotics team is looking to automate 75% of operations, the report said. Amazon denied the claims in the report. A spokesperson added that the e-commerce giant plans to hire 250,000 people for the upcoming holiday season, but did not share how many of those positions will be permanent. UPS recently announced 34,000 job cuts, while Target launched a layoff round impacting 1,800 roles. These cuts could grow worse over the next decade, as AI and automation could wipe out nearly 100 million jobs, according to a report released by Sen. Bernie Sanders (l-Vt.). Some Gen Zers might be looking to pivot to industries that are more immune to shocks from tech advancements – and healthcare has emerged as a bright spot. Home health aides are among the roles least impacted by the rise of AI, with nearly 740,000 new positions expected to open up over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although it only has a median annual pay of about $35,000, the role has a low barrier to entry, often requiring only a high school diploma and brief on-the-job training. Over the next decade, the US is expected to see about 1.9 million healthcare job openings over the next year, according to the BLS. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse anesthetists and health services managers offer higher median pay and long-term stability, though these paths typically require more advanced degrees. Even techies like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis have agreed that healthcare remains fairly safe from the AI chopping block. “There’s a lot of things that we won’t want to do with a machine,” Hassabis previously said. “You wouldn’t want a robot nurse – there’s something about the human empathy aspect of that care that’s particularly humanistic.” Advertisement

The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: Elon Musk’s future at Tesla in balance as shareholders consider $1 trillion pay package

Full Content:
Elon Musk’s future at Tesla could hang in the balance on Thursday when shareholders vote on whether to approve his record-shattering $1 trillion pay package. The controversial proposal, which is scheduled to be considered at Tesla’s annual meeting in Texas, would hand Musk an unprecedented payout tied to a series of performance benchmarks. Critics – including key proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis and even Pope Leo XIV – argue the proposed salary is excessive. Meanwhile, Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm and Musk himself have warned that he could leave the company entirely if shareholders reject the proposal. “Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,” Denholm said in a recent letter posted on X. Musk has framed the vote in near-apocalyptic terms – declaring in an Oct. 29 X post that “control of Tesla could affect the future of civilization.” The billionaire has argued that he needs greater voting control offered by the stock grants in order to effectively guide Tesla’s future plans for artificial intelligence, which include the robots and full self-driving technology. Musk would control nearly 29% of voting shares if he hits all targets. The jaw-dropping pay package, unveiled in a September proxy filing, was crafted by Tesla’s board after a Delaware judge struck down a previous $56 billion compensation plan for Musk. The judge ruled that the previous package, which was approved in 2018, was excessive and riddled with conflicts of interest. Under the latest proposal, one tranche of Musk’s pay would be awarded if Tesla hits a $2 trillion valuation and delivers 20 million vehicles. Another would kick in if Tesla is valued at $3 trillion and delivers 1 million of its “Optimus” humanoid robots. The new pay package drew a major rebuke this week from Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which became the largest Tesla stakeholder to say it opposed the plan. “While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” stated Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Tesla shares were down nearly 5% in Tuesday’s trading. Pope Leo XIV previously cited Musk’s pay package as an example of the loss of “the value of human life, of the family, of the value of society.” “Yesterday, the news [arrived] that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world,” Leo told Catholic news outlet Crux in an interview published in September. “What does that mean, and what’s that about?” the pontiff continued. “If that is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.” ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended that shareholders say no, asserting that the pay is excessive and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Tesla’s largest individual investors, including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, have yet to reveal how they plan to vote. Despite the lingering uncertainty, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expects shareholders to give a “bright green light” to the plan. “With the AI Revolution this is a crucial time for Tesla ahead with autonomous and robotics front and center,” Ives said in a note to clients on Monday. “We expect shareholders to show overwhelming support for Musk and the xAI stake further turning Tesla into an AI juggernaut with the autonomous and robotics future on the horizon.” With Post wires Advertisement

Title: Altcoin giant Animoca Brands aims to go public next year, listing will test investor appetite for exotic crypto assets

Another crypto company is headed to Wall Street. Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based blockchain developer and investor, plans to list on the Nasdaq via a reverse merger with Currenc, which is a Singapore-based fintech company. The planned public listing is notable because Animoca stands out from other recent crypto offerings, including Circle and Gemini, because its business does not revolve around exchanges or stablecoins. Instead, the firm’s focus is in altcoins, or cryptocurrencies other than mainstays like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Animoca has invested in over 600 blockchain companies, according to a statement released on Monday. Some of its most notable past investments include stakes in the failed metaverse platform Sandbox. “The proposed merger of Animoca Brands and Currenc will result in the world’s first publicly-listed, diversified digital assets conglomerate,” said Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands. The deal is set to be finalized in 2026. Animoca’s shareholders will own 95% of the company and current shareholders of Currenc will own the other 5%, according to the statement. Reverse mergers and SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, like the one Animoca is pursuing, have become one of the preferred ways for crypto companies to launch on the stock market. In late 2022, the stablecoin issuer Circle prepared to merge with a SPAC, only to see that plan fall through. And Securitize, the tokenization firm with ties to BlackRock, announced last week that it would go public via a SPAC of its own. And in May, American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining and holding company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., announced it was going public through a reverse merger with the company Gryphon Digital Mining. This is not Animoca’s first experience with public markets. It was previously listed on the Australian Securities Exchanges before being delisted in 2020 because of concerns about compliance with listing rules. The Animoca reverse merger coincides with a rough moment for altcoins, as the market has fallen $800 billion short of what past cycles would suggest. Retail investors in South Korea have flocked to crypto-linked equities instead, and last month’s flash crash put a dent in non-Bitcoin tokens. Despite altcoins’ shortcomings, investors have flocked to certain tokens, which have experienced an unprecedented surge under Donald Trump’s administration. Solana and Binance Coin both have notched all-time highs in the past year. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: 5 clear signals that will prove if the Bitcoin bull run is still alive

If everyone is buying Bitcoin why is it falling? $715M says they are not. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto Twitter is filled with claims that “everyone is buying Bitcoin”, from Michael Saylor and BlackRock to entire countries and even banks. Yet despite the accumulation narratives, Bitcoin’s price has slipped sharply, breaking below key levels as ETF flows turned negative. The contradiction between bullish headlines and falling prices emphasizes a crucial point: in markets driven by liquidity and marginal flow, who’s actually buying, and when, matters far more than who says they are. Bitcoin fell through $106,400 as spot ETF flows turned negative over four consecutive sessions. The shift came as BlackRock’s IBIT logged redemptions over the last four days, totaling $714.8 million, removing a significant source of daily demand right as a widely watched cycle pivot gave way. According to Farside Investors, the outflows of $88.1 million, $290.9 million, $149.3 million, and then $186.5 million coincided with the breakdown. They forced selling by authorized participants who redeemed shares for underlying Bitcoin and offloaded them into the market. Thus, the net flow flipped. When creations slow and redemptions rise across the U.S. spot ETF complex, the daily bid that helped absorb volatility turns into a source of supply. Mid-October saw stretches of net outflows across digital asset funds as Bitcoin battled to stay above $106,400. While there were brief inflow days late in the month, the most recent run tilted back into the red, a pattern that aligns with the IBIT prints captured above. The mechanical impact matters because ETF flow translates into spot buys or sells, and the timing overlaps with a break of a level that many traders use to distinguish a late-cycle pullback from a trend resumption. The CME three-month futures premium has cooled to roughly 4 to 5 percent annualized over the back half of the year, curbing carry-trade incentives that pull institutional basis demand into rallies. At the same time, funding on perpetual swaps turned softer or negative at points, a setup that accelerates down moves when longs de-risk and liquidations cluster. In these conditions, slow, scheduled spot accumulation from corporates or sovereign entities does not offset forced unwinds on leverage or redemptions on regulated products that translate directly to spot sells. Macro has not eased the path. The U.S. Dollar Index rebounded toward the 98-100 area in November after a weak first half, while the U.S. 10-year yield, near 4.1 percent, keeps real rates restrictive. A firmer dollar and tight real yields tend to compress global liquidity and weigh on long-duration risk, and bitcoin continues to respond to those impulses at tactical horizons. When flows are roughly flat, the dollar often decides whether a bounce holds or fades. Supply narratives also persist. The Mt. Gox rehabilitation timeline was extended again to October 31, 2026, following partial distributions earlier this year, which keeps a recurring overhang in focus, even if actual sales are staggered. Periodic trustee updates and wallet movements have repeatedly tightened risk tolerance on rebounds. Miners remain another valve. Post-halving economics has also left hashprice near cycle lows relative to the spring spike. That backdrop creates ongoing incentives for treasury monetization on stress days, which can align with soft funding to add procyclical pressure. I recently called $126,000 as the cycle high and $106,400 as the bull-bear pivot. The price just lost that pivot as the ETF bid turned into net selling, while basis stayed subdued and funding cooled. Interestingly, common on-chain and cycle monitors, such as the 2-Year MA Multiplier, Pi Cycle Top, and RHODL, have failed to reach euphoria this cycle, even near the highs. Metrics are already slipping toward distribution and mean reversion as flow support has faded. This could mean the bull run will be extended this cycle, or it could represent diminishing returns when compared to prior cycle transitions. These tools are not standalone timing devices. Still, when they align with daily flow inflection and macro stiffness, traders tend to withdraw liquidity, which amplifies the impact of incremental sells. Nation-state purchases are episodic and small compared to daily turnover, and corporate treasuries operate on idiosyncratic schedules. Banks often facilitate client activity rather than deploying balance-sheet risk daily. None of those actors offset a week where issuers that normally create shares instead redeem, funding drifts toward or below zero, and the dollar firms. The marginal seller rules the tape in that mix. The near-term path depends on whether spot creations reappear and the basis expands. A continued run of net outflow days from the largest U.S. spot ETFs, especially IBIT and FBTC, with CME basis pinned near or below 5 percent annualized and funding flat to negative, would keep the market in a distribution phase. Under that setup, failing to reclaim $106,400 leaves $100,000 as the battleground and opens the mid to high $90,000s on further red sessions, particularly if the macro stays tight. A more neutral outcome, with oscillating but smaller flows, a basis stabilizing in the 5-7 percent zone, and a range-bound dollar around 97-100, argues for digestion between $100,000 and $106,000 while liquidity rebuilds. The upside case requires a return of multi-day net creations in the $300 to $800 million range across the complex, based on pushing above 8 to 10 percent, and a softer dollar. That mix would allow a retest of $110,000 to $115,000 and reopen the debate around the cycle top if flows persist. One way to track the state of play is to focus on daily issuer-level flows, then layer in derivatives and macroeconomic factors. The last four trading days flipped the spot-ETF bid into a sustained net seller, exactly as Bitcoin lost its pivot. With CME basis subdued and funding soft, the marginal price was driven by de-risking rather than dip-buying. A firmer USD and sticky real yields rounded out a flow-led break, not a referendum on long-term adoption. Until daily creations return and $ 106,400 is reclaimed, this remains a distribution-and-digest phase within the broader cycle. Lastly, unless the historic Bitcoin cycle pattern has been disrupted by the influx of corporate treasuries and ETF flows, then Father Time has already spoken. If Bitcoin were to reach a new all-time high by the end of the year or in 2026, it would mark the latest cycle high ever.

Title: IBM layoffs: Tech giant to cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth — Who will get affected?

IBM layoffs: Amid over one lakh job cuts in major tech companies across the world, International Business Machines Corp (IBM) is set to reduce thousands of roles to focus on software growth, reported Bloomberg News. The job cuts will take place in this quarter as the company shifts focus to software and service. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly,” the report said, quoting a company spokesperson. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce.” According to Reuters, IBM last month recorded a slowdown in growth in the key cloud software segment. Its shares, which have risen over 35% this year, were down close to 2% on Tuesday. Some US workers may be affected by the job reductions, but employment in the country is anticipated to remain roughly the same year over year, the spokesperson said. The company employed about 270,000 workers as of the end of 2024. In recent months, several tech companies, including Amazon, TCS and Microsoft among others have announced layoffs as the focus shifts to artificial intelligence. According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs - over 112,732 tech workers have been laid off across 218 tech companies in 2025 alone. Last week, Amazon announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people, with more cuts expected next year. The online retailer began laying off employees across multiple divisions as part of a plan. Amazon will offer most affected workers 90 days to look for a new role internally and said its recruiting teams would prioritize those candidates, reported Reuters. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm's total workforce count witnessed a 19,755 fall to 593,314 as of the second quarter of the financial year 2025-26. Microsoft, the second most valuable publicly listed company after Nvidia globally, has so far laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025. However, CEO Satya Nadella recently said that the tech giant plans to expand its workforce, but the focus will now be on a more strategic and leveraged approach post-AI revolution.

Fans of the Just Cause series will have to say their goodbyes to Rico Rodriguez as Just Cause 5 won’t be happening. Creator of the Just Cause Series Christofer Sundberg announced that Just Cause 5 at Avalanche Studios is basically a “no-go.” Co-founder and creator of Just Cause, Sundberg left Avalanche Studios in 2019. After gazing at leaked screenshots of the now-canceled Contraband game, he said, “#JC5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.” According to Sundberg, he made a “qualified guess”, but later followed up with replies and revealed that deeper issues plague Avalanche Studios, specifically talent drain that began right during the troubled production of Just Cause 4. Just Cause 4 was released nearly seven years ago on December 4, 2018, and received mixed reviews from the get-go, mainly due to glitches, weather mechanics, and a pivot from the franchise’s core chaotic mayhem. However, post-launch updates appeased longtime fans of the series. In his post, Sundberg took partial blame for the troubled development of Just Cause 4, stating: The problems with JC4 were partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles, and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise. However, fans aren’t giving up on the Just Cause series. One user declared that Just Cause 5 might save the company. However, Sundberg shot him down and said, “I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off, and make games; the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not fit into one.” Unfortunately, Avalanche’s problems have only mounted since the studio halted development on Contraband, which was supposed to be a 1970s co-op smuggling game. The project was initially proposed by Sundberg and his team to Microsoft earlier in 2017. However, Microsoft’s restructuring plans rolled in, leading to the cancellation of Contraband and massive layoffs at Avalanche. By late September, Avalanche announced that it would close down its Liverpool office and cut down staff in Malmo and Stockholm, amid “industry challenges.” Buy Just Cause 4 on Amazon CHSundberg – X

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Numerous companies have called out AI for being the reason for the culling With layoffs hitting global industries across their workforces, companies are claiming a new culprit: the rise of artificial intelligence. Numerous brands, including major tech corporations like Amazon, have pointed to AI as the reason for the most recent wave of job cuts. But some labor analysts claim that blaming AI is simply a way for these companies to avoid taking responsibility when they downsize. Even as companies have been “blaming the promise of productivity with artificial intelligence for their decisions,” there is “uneven evidence that the promised cost-savings from AI are actually worth what companies are putting into it,” said NBC News. This has left some people “questioning whether AI could be serving as a fig leaf for companies that are laying off employees for old-fashioned reasons,” such as a company’s poor financial performance. It is “much easier for a company to say, ‘We are laying workers off because we’re realizing AI-related efficiencies’ than to say, ‘We’re laying people off because we’re not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,’” David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said to NBC. Even if AI wasn’t the reason for a particular layoff, companies would “be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI.” Escape your echo chamber.

The most notable example of this is Amazon, which has announced a new wave of 14,000 job cuts. This “came just a few months after CEO Andrew Jassy said the rollout of AI technology was likely to spell job cuts,” said Al Jazeera. But while experts are skeptical, AI “may be” at fault for the Amazon cuts. This “latest move signals that Amazon is likely realizing enough AI-driven productivity gains within corporate teams to support a substantial reduction in force,” Sky Canaves, an eMarketer analyst, said to Reuters. Despite these changes at Amazon, many people have “voiced skepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment,” said BBC News. There is a “real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labor market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements,” Martha Gimbel, the executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University, said to the BBC. Whether AI is truly at fault or not, there’s no question that the technology is replacing certain jobs. In July 2025, Microsoft released a research paper outlining 40 occupations the company thinks could be outsourced to AI. At the top of the list were interpreters and translators, followed by historians, passenger attendants, sales representatives, writers and customer service representatives. The job that Microsoft felt was the safest from AI was a phlebotomist, followed by nursing assistants, waste removal workers, painters, embalmers and plant operators. Understanding the “effects of AI on the economy” will become “one of society’s most important” efforts, the paper said. This has especially been true in the “last several years,” as “generative AI has come to the fore as the next candidate general purpose technology, capable of improving or speeding up tasks as varied as medical diagnosis and software development.” Its extensive reach has already been “reflected in the astounding rate of AI adoption.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

David Ellison isn’t afraid to get in the ring. As the Paramount chief builds a Hollywood juggernaut that could soon swallow Warner Bros. Discovery whole, a different type of construction is taking place 3,000 miles away: Sources say that President Donald Trump has greenlit plans to host one of the first UFC fights under Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal with the MMA league on the lawn of the White House. Dignitaries from around the world will attend a dinner and then head to the Octagon, the eight-sided ring where the main event will play out. Trump and UFC CEO Dana White are spearheading the telecast. The discussed date is June 14, 2026 — which coincides with Trump’s 80th birthday.

In rapid-fire fashion, the 42-year-old Ellison has become show business’ ultimate disruptor. The industry’s first millennial mogul wants to change the DNA of Hollywood while building a new type of entertainment leviathan out of the husk of a once-legendary film and television studio. And Paramount, which declined to comment, is just the beginning. “We’re going after Warners,” Ellison told confidants even before the Paramount deal got the Trump administration’s approval. “I want to be in the top three, not the bottom three.” By the accounts of many industry insiders, Ellison has been busy leveraging his family’s extraordinary wealth and access to President Trump to prepare for a buying spree. With the help of his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison (the world’s second-richest person behind Elon Musk), the Silicon Valley scion wants to take on Netflix, Amazon and Apple; in the hypercompetitive Ellison family, there’s no prize for being runner-up. If the Ellisons pull it off, they’ll control a media empire with unprecedented reach and cultural influence. “It’s the Wild West, and these are the new cowboys,” says producer Jon Peters, who ran Sony Pictures from 1989 to 1991. Peters says he has taken a $400 million-plus stake — roughly 4% — in Paramount since it began trading on the Nasdaq as PSKY. “Things have changed,” Peters adds, “and now we’re moving into the biggest revolution that you and I will ever see in our life, which is AI.” When Skydance took over Paramount, it pointedly referred to itself as a media and technology company. Ellison has repeatedly said that he wants to “embrace AI,” and in meetings he alludes to having developed revolutionary ways to understand what consumers want by accessing vast troves of data. He’s fond of boasting that Oracle’s technological know-how will transform Paramount+ from a second-rate app to a dominant player with a better user experience. (Where all that data comes from remains a mystery.) Some industry observers are skeptical that it will be enough to compete with Netflix and its mighty algorithm. They also believe that even if traditional studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. combine, Netflix and the other streaming giants are so much better established that it will be nearly impossible to catch up. “Studios are irrelevant; they’re on the ropes. They’re dinosaurs, and the age of dinosaurs is over,” says Schuyler Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker. “Their only move now is to consolidate, but there’s no hope even if they get bigger. They’re too late to the party.” Not according to David Ellison, who projects an image of Paramount as a land of abundance. He wants “more content, not less,” says one source with direct knowledge of his thinking. The proof is in the mad dash his film chiefs are making to build their slate from its current eight annual releases to 15 by 2026, 17 by 2027 and 18 by 2028. Cindy Holland, who helped Netflix develop its original programming strategy and is now running Paramount’s direct-to-consumer operation, is opening the purse to bring better programming to Paramount+. Hollywood may be wary of the Ellison family. The WGA called the prospect of Paramount buying Warner Bros. Discovery “a disaster for writers, for consumers, and for competition” and vowed to work with regulators to block the merger. But an industry still reeling from the collapse of Peak TV has been reenergized by the emergence of a new, deep-pocketed buyer. And analysts credit Ellison for embracing an expansive vision. “They clearly have a long-term point of view,” says Jessica Reif Ehrlich, Bank of America Securities senior media and entertainment analyst. “They have a plan to invest in more compelling content, and they are executing on it.” Since taking over Paramount, Team Ellison has embraced Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” spending money freely, like purchasing Bari Weiss’ The Free Press — a fledgling Substack-based news outlet — for $150 million. It has also slashed staff and dispensed with top Paramount executives at a dizzying rate, replacing them with executives with unfashionable — by Hollywood standards — viewpoints, from vocal Israel supporters (CBS News editor-in-chief Weiss) to political conservatives (Paramount co-chair Josh Greenstein), and jumped into business with a new brand of power brokers, namely White. Those who remain have faced pointed questions, often delivered in blunt tones, that betray irritation at how inefficiently the new regime feels the legacy media companyhad been run. Taking a page from the MAGA playbook, Ellison doesn’t seem to care about optics. An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. A source close to Paramount says the October layoffs were not motivated by MAGA politics or gender. But Israel is an important issue. Larry Ellison is reportedly a close friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is a prolific donor to Friends of the IDF. Weiss has been so vocal in her support of the country that she faces frequent death threats. She and her wife, The Free Press co-founder Nellie Bowles, require a detail of five bodyguards that costs the studio $10,000-$15,000 a day. There has also been a noticeable step-up in security measures around the company’s executive leadership (one insider says the entire C-suite has received threats). Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. Around the studio lot and offices, open debate about business strategy, even arguments that can grow heated, are more frequent than under the previous regime. Greenstein, a former top Sony executive enlisted to run the studio with Skydance veteran Dana Goldberg, is said to have a differing professional style from his boss, Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who was installed as Paramount’s president. A person who observed them together compares them to “oil and water.” Ellison has not been immune to pushback from his staff. Greenstein and Goldberg tried — and failed — to dissuade their boss from giving Will Smith and his company Westbrook an overall deal with the studio, arguing that the Oscar-slap controversy and a dodgy box office track record would result in more headaches than hits. Despite the disagreements over strategy, there is a shared sense of urgency around the need to fundamentally transform Paramount, as the new executive leadership recognizes it must move fast to pull off its grand plans. In addition to signing talent deals with Smith and Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers behind Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” the team is trying to assemble a slate of films that can attract audiences to theaters at a time when the box office is in a slump. Ellison personally courted “A Complete Unknown”’s James Mangold and is shelling out up to $100 million to produce “High Side,” a motocross thriller that will be the director’s next film with Timothée Chalamet. Insiders at Paramount insist that the film will cost less and no official budget has been set. Some long-gestating productions, such as the Miles Teller sports drama “Winter Games,” have been put into turnaround, while there has also been a focus on reinvigorating certain franchises. The hope is to have a fresh “Star Trek” movie, though the studio has moved on from the idea of bringing back Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the ensemble from the J.J. Abrams reboot. It is also working on sequels to “Top Gun” and “Days of Thunder,” with the films’ star, Tom Cruise, recently visiting the Paramount lot to congratulate the Skydance team on its takeover and to discuss a return to those franchises and other possible collaborations. (Some of the films that Paramount is greenlighting, including a movie about a cowboy and his dog searching for his missing daughter that’s been likened to a Western version of “Taken,” were described as “America-centric” and geared toward the middle of the country.) Not everything has gone smoothly. The Skydance team was shocked when Taylor Sheridan, the creator of many of Paramount+’s biggest franchises, such as “Yellowstone” and “Tulsa King,” defected for a lucrative deal with NBCUniversal. Ellison had spent time cultivating Sheridan, flying down to Texas with Shell, Greenstein and Goldberg, where the new mogul suggested possible shows that could be additions to the Sheridan-verse. The overtures backfired, with Sheridan preferring a less corporate approach. Although Sheridan, whose content plays big in red state America and presumably would have fit in seamlessly with the new mentality, has three years remaining on his deal with Paramount, his exit leaves a big hole. “It’s a huge loss for them,” says Ehrlich. “If you look at Paramount+, [Sheridan] is responsible for 90% of their successful programming.” Before he leaves, though, Sheridan will help Paramount deliver on one of Ellison’s biggest priorities; he’s been tapped to write the screenplay for “Call of Duty,” an adaptation of the popular video game franchise that encapsulates the kind of patriotic, flag-waving films that the studio wants to make. Directing the film is Peter Berg, who recently said on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” “I think Trump’s doing some great things” — the type of sentiment that could land talent on a blacklist anywhere but Paramount. In person, Ellison has an “aw-shucks” demeanor and strikes people who have worked with him as wonky, unfailingly polite and a little shy. But since he took the reins at Paramount, he’s instilled a very different climate from the left-leaning one found at most major studios. Prior to the merger, television sets in executive offices were usually turned to CNBC or CNN. Now, some employees have conspicuously changed the channel to Fox News, according to one executive. Another source, however, disputes this and says most of the offices are still being renovated and have television sets that have yet to be mounted or plugged in. Over on the Melrose lot, Greenstein boasts about hitting the shooting range, while at CBS News’ midtown headquarters, the race and culture unit — formed in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 — has been dissolved. There’s a reason for the cultural shift. After all, Larry Ellison’s loyalty to the president has already paid off. The Trump administration greenlit the Paramount Skydance merger, despite antitrust concerns, and allowed the Oracle co-founder to be part of a consortium to acquire TikTok that also includes conservative-leaning Lachlan Murdoch. Now, Ellison advisers are privately crowing that they are the only viable choice to buy Warner Bros. Discovery given that rivals would face obstacles from U.S. regulators, whereas the Ellisons could get the deal done. Trump already has given Weiss a vote of confidence, saying that CBS News has “great potential” and that he expects coverage to be “fairer” now. For his part, Trump told a press gaggle aboard Air Force One in mid-October that Larry and David Ellison “are friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine.” Then, with a line that could have been lifted from “The Godfather,” the president added, “And they’ll do the right thing.” Most of Hollywood is buzzing about what the U.S. cultural landscape might look like if the Ellisons succeed in acquiring CNN — and the rest of Warner Bros. Discovery. The Ellisons have made two offers for Warner Bros. Discovery after floating a trial balloon in September about its plan to bid, which had the effect of putting the company in play. Netflix is reportedly considering making its own offer, though some industry sources believe the streamer is mostly trying to drive up the price Paramount Skydance will need to pay. The expectation is that the Ellisons will prevail, and when they do, they’ll have access to a far richer and deeper library than the one they control at Paramount. The Burbank studio boasts DC Studios and its arsenal of superheroes, certain rights to “Harry Potter” and HBO, still the preeminent tastemaker in the television world. However, all that premium content might not be enough to resolve the fundamental problems with the business models of legacy media companies like Paramount — namely, that linear broadcast and cable channels still account for as much as 80% of Paramount’s annual revenues. And television is losing audience rapidly to streamers. That’s created the conditions in which two of the five remaining traditional studios feel the pressure to merge — to get bigger in order to withstand the headwinds. “Despite the volatility of the movie industry, for 100 years it was one of the most stable industries in the history of American business,” says Snap chairman and former Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton. “The same six players were there from the very outset, with the possible exception of RKO. And those same players stayed there without consolidation. It was almost impossible to have a new entrant because you needed a big library and distribution, and obviously that took years and years to create. Then technology companies came in. They became incredibly disruptive. That’s in large part the reason why you’re seeing what you’re seeing happening now [with the Ellisons].” The Ellisons should be careful what they wish for; most media mergers ultimately aren’t worth the time and effort. For every smart acquisition, like Disney’s purchase of Marvel, there’s a corporate catastrophe on the scale of AOL Time Warner. Synergies often fail to materialize, and it takes upwards of three years for companies to integrate. David Ellison is aware of that tangled history, telling acquaintances that he doesn’t want any purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery to mirror Disney’s $71.3 billion deal for much of 21st Century Fox — a pact that is now widely considered to have been too costly. “Almost every major media deal has been a disaster,” says Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst with TD Cowen. “People always convince themselves that even though they’ve all blown up in the past, this time it will work for them, and they’re almost always wrong.” While David Ellison is the frontman in the family’s Hollywood forays, there is a sense that he is moving in lockstep with his father, who brings a mentality far different from what has reigned in Hollywood for more than a century — that the mogul with the most content wins. Instead, he follows a different guiding principle. “Larry Ellison has a fundamental belief that the guy with the most data wins,” says Derek Reisfield, the first president of CBS New Media (now CBS Interactive) and co-founder of MarketWatch. “That’s been his mantra at Oracle. That’s what is going on with the Warner Bros. Discovery bid. And Larry wants to salt the earth so the competitors can’t come back. By buying all this now and doing it quickly when he has an advantage, it’s sort of game over for everybody else.” Among Paramount’s competitors, Netflix is said to be most shaken by Ellison’s arrival — and his seemingly endless supply of capital. (A spokesperson for Netflix denies that characterization.) Paramount’s resurgence comes as Netflix is being targeted by the MAGA faithful with calls for consumers to cancel their subscriptions due to what they label as “woke” content aimed at kids. And Wall Street seems to have its concerns, handing Netflix, on Oct. 22, its single worst day since 2022. Whether or not the Ellisons capture the Warners flag, they face morale problems. The first round of layoffs cut deep enough. But another 1,000 pink slips are expected globally in the second round. The prospect of full AI integration spells doom for many at a time when spirits are already low. Some say they could overlook the studio’s Trumpian turn, which could have reverberations right down to the news division. But they are incensed by the casual bloodletting of Oct. 29, carried out in a drip-drip throughout the day, stoking greater anxiety. “I’ve lost a lot of friends. A lot of really great writers and a lot of really great journalists have lost their jobs to pay for Bari’s six bodyguards and $150 million deal,” says a CBS News staffer. “And I think that’s bullshit.” Another Paramount executive was shocked by how coldly the company dispensed with people who had worked there for decades. “They didn’t show a lot of respect,” the exec says. “I’ve been through other mergers, and there’s no other word to describe this one than merciless. It’s a new way of doing business.” The Business of Entertainment

Here is a tally of who's had layoffs in 2025 so far. Global job losses in fashion and footwear are climbing in 2025. Shoe firms and fashion retailers — including Nike, Puma, Saks Global and Target, among others — are cutting jobs as part of a larger trend across corporate America and beyond. So far in 2025, the tally has reached a minimum of 17,267 job cuts. Global shipping and logistics firm United Parcel Service Inc., which ships many of the online shoe orders, conducted sweeping cuts this year that saw 48,000 positions eliminated thus far. UPS is moving more operations toward automation. It also will see a 50 percent cut in its Amazon package volume by the middle of 2026.

Intel is slated to cut 24,000 jobs, while Microsoft is expected to shed 9,000 employees. Consulting firm Accenture is believed to be cutting at least 11,000 this year, mostly in roles that do not match current AI needs. Other sectors are cutting jobs too, Chevron is shedding 8,000 jobs while competitor BP cut 7,700 roles, and beauty firm Estée Lauder is cutting 7,000 positions this year. You May Also Like A report last month from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said there were nearly 950,000 job cuts in the U.S. from January through September, representing the highest year-to-day total since 2020 when nearly 2.1 million cuts were announced and the fifth highest year-to-date total in the 36 years Challenger has reported. It noted that many of the cuts are due to AI and automation gains. A flurry of job elimination announcements in October adds to that 950,000 tally. And while the government sector has born the brunt of the jobs lost thus far, the Challenger report noted that tech and retail have also been impacted. Overall, Challenger said U.S. retailers thus far through September have announced 86,233 job cuts, up 203 percent from the 28,440 cuts announced during the same year-ago period. The tally for U.S. retail does not separate out data either for different retail sectors or by distribution channel. “Now is when we typically see retailers bulk up for the holidays, but so far, plans have been slow to come, reflecting caution. With lower consumer confidence and tariff pressures ahead, we predict the hiring season will be muted,” Challenger’s senior vice president and labor expert Andy Challenger said. Below is the list of fashion firms cutting jobs. Adidas AG Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said in January that the company will shed 500 “obsolete” positions at company headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. The job cuts weren’t part of any cost-savings plan but aimed at “reducing complexity and ensure sustainable success in the future.” Amazon.com Inc. The online marketplace platform, said in October that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs. It’s the latest in a line of job cuts since the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in the job cuts were an undisclosed number from its Zappos division. Amazon acquired Zappos in July 2009 in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.2 billion. Burberry Group plc The British fashion firm said in May it would eliminate 1,700 jobs, or 18 percent of its worldwide workforce. The move is part of a strategy to cut about $130 million in costs by 2027. Burberry posted an operating loss of 3 million pounds and a 17 percent drop in revenue for the year that ended in March. Carter’s Inc. The company said in October that it would lay off 300 corporate staffers, or 15 percent of its workforce, by the end of this year. The company also said it plans to close 150 North American stores over the next three years, about 50 more doors than initially expected. The cuts were disclosed when the children’s retailer said third quarter profits were down, impacted largely by tariffs. In addition to apparel, the retailer also sells shoes and socks. Hudson’s Bay Co. The Hudson’s Bay retail chain, Canada’s oldest department store for over 350 years, shut down operations in May following the conclusion of its liquidation sale. The shut-down resulted in the loss of 8,347 jobs. Kohl’s Corp. The department store retailer said in late January that it had cut about 10 percent of its corporate jobs. The expectation was that half of those cuts would be from the elimination of open positions. Kohl’s also said in early January when it was still led by then CEO Tom Kingsbury that it was closing 27 store locations. The retailer has been under the leadership of interim CEO Michael Bender since May. Lululemon The yoga-inspired apparel brand said in June that 150 jobs would be cut at corporate headquarters as part of a change-up of its organizational structure. The eliminated positions were from Lululemon’s store support centers. A company spokesperson told Footwear News that the change-up was to allow the company to “operate with more agility and further invest in our growth.” Macy’s Inc. The department store retailer is closing a distribution center in South Windsor, Conn., starting on Dec. 28, 2025. A Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice indicated that 106 employees will be impacted by the closure. The warehouse is connected to Macy’s Backstage operation, according to the WARN notice. Backstage is Macy’s off-price banner. The closure is part of the retailer’s “Bold New Chapter” initiative, a three-year turnaround strategy started in 2024 aimed at leveraging synergies across its brands between warehousing, legal, finance and back-end operations that include its supply chain network. Nike Inc. The sportswear and footwear brand also known as Swoosh told employees in August that it planned to reduce its corporate staff by 1 percent. The move is a follow-up to the company’s disclosure when it posted fourth quarter results in June that would realigning its operations and review cost-cutting measures as it continued with its turnaround strategy. When Nike reported first quarter results on Sept. 30, it said that 8,000 employees were redirected to its “Sport Offense” initiative that aligns its three brands — Nike, Jordan and Converse — “into more nimble-focused teams by sport.” The brand also laid off some tech employees in May and June, moving some of that work to third-party vendors. It wasn’t immediately clear how many jobs were impacted by the shift. Nike cut over 1,600 jobs in 2024 as part of its $2 billion cost-savings plan. Puma SE The sportswear brand’s new CEO Arthur Hoeld said Thursday that the company would cut its “white collar” workforce by 900 jobs, bringing the total job cuts to 1,400 for the year. The reduction in staffing follows the 500 jobs cut in March. In total, Puma will have cut about 20 percent of its corporate workforce this year. Hoeld also said that Puma likely wouldn’t return to healthy growth until 2027. The disclosures were made as the company posted third quarter earnings results. QVC Group QVC Group, parent of the QVC and HSN home shopping TV networks, said in March that it would lay off 900 employees, or 5 percent of its global workforce, as part of a company reorganization. About 700 were from the HSN operation, following its move from a St. Petersburg campus in Florida to a Studio Park in West Chester, Penn., the home base for QVC. The home shopping network is shifting from primarily a cable TV model to a live social shopping platform. To that end, QVC Group is deepening its partnership with TikTok, a social and e-commerce platform that provides 24/7 shoppable livestream content. The company in February changed its name to QVC Group from Qurate. REI Co-op The retailer in January said it would cut 428 jobs, including 180 full-time roles and 248 part-time guides. The move is connected with the outdoor specialty retailer’s decision to shutter its 38-year-old adventure travel business Experiences. More layoffs are expected in 2026 when the outdoor retailer closes its Paramus, N.J. store in the first quarter, followed by its Boston, Mass., location and its high profile 40,000 square-foot SoHo, N.Y., door later in the year. Saks Global The parent of Saks Fifth Avenue in August said it was cutting 90 employees, bringing the total jobs cut this year to 1,236. Saks Global in April cut 446 positions when it shuttered a fulfillment center in La Vergne, Tenn., as well as 550 workers who held positions considered duplicate roles across both store and corporate functions in connection to its Neiman Marcus integration. Saks Global acquired Neiman Marcus in December 2024 in a $2.7 billion transaction. And in February, Saks Global cut about 150 from its corporate staff across finance, legal and operations. Target Corp. The mass discounter said in October that it was eliminating 1,800 corporate positions, which includes 800 open jobs that will go unfilled. Michael Fiddelke, Target’s incoming CEO — he takes on the role starting on Feb. 1, 2026 — and current chief operating officer said in a memo to employees that the retailer’s changes to its corporate structure was due to “too many layers and overlapping work” that has resulted in slowed decision-making. VF Corp. As part of the firm’s strategy to turnaround its business, an additional 400 more positions would be cut across the apparel and shoe giant’s global operations. The company said in January that cuts were forthcoming as part of its reorganization efforts, but didn’t disclose the total number of employees who would be impacted. Last November, VF said it would cut over 242 jobs due to the planned closure of its distribution in Martinsville, Va., with the shutdown to occur in March. Only $24.99 for one year!

Title: Rise of the AI Job-Killing Machines

Amazon, Paramount Skydance and others have made mass layoffs. Is artificial intelligence the culprit? By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America? Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.” A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Related Stories 'Kevin Costner Presents: The First Christmas,' 'Prep & Landing' Specials Set for ABC Holiday Programming Schedule 'Monday Night Football': How to Watch the NFL Game Live Online Without Cable Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI, saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative. He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%). Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago. In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.” In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.” Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees. A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg. AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap. The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report. Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps. But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.” “AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,”actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation. Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs.

Title: Rise of the AI Job-Killing Machines

Amazon, Paramount Skydance and others have made mass layoffs. Is artificial intelligence the culprit? By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America? Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.” A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI, saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative. He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%). Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago. In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.” In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.” Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees. A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg. AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap. The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report. Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps. But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.” “AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,”actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation. Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs. Just one example: Google, which didn’t exist three decades ago, employed 190,167 people as of the end of September. Some Hollywood leaders, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, have pushed the idea that AI is a net positive for creatives. “AI isn’t replacing storytellers — it’s creating tools that empower them to tell stories they never could before,” he said last month on an episode of the “Aspire With Emma Grede” podcast. In the same breath, however, Sarandos wondered whether making a “$300 million or $400 million movie” makes sense if the “monetization model” doesn’t justify the math.

Title: America’s wealthiest billionaires got $698 billion richer this year, while the average home earned $83,000—and the gap’s set to get wider under Trump

Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies. While Americans are pinching their pennies amid SNAP cuts, soaring housing costs, and mass layoffs, the ultra-rich are seeing unprecedented wealth gains. In the coming years, we could even have our first trillionaire: Elon Musk. Now, a new report from Oxfam has revealed that the 10 richest U.S. billionaires added $698 billion to their net worths in the past year. Nearly the entire ultra-rich cohort is made up of tech leaders profiting from the gold rush in tech and AI, including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Dell founder Michael Dell. On average, each person on America’s top 10 rich list gained $69.8 billion over the past year—they made 833,631 times more than what the typical American household takes home. While Musk defends his eye-watering $1 trillion pay package, the average U.S. household only brought in $83,730 last year, according to U.S. Census data. While billionaires are getting richer, Americans are scraping by on their measly paychecks. Over 40% of the U.S. population—including nearly 50% of children—are considered to be poor or low income, according to the report. And looking at trends within the last few decades, the worsening wealth divide is even more stark. Between 1989 and 2022, a rich U.S. household at the 99th percentile (or top 1%) gained 101 times more wealth than the average home. In fact, the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans today own 12.6% of assets and 24% of the stock market. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the U.S. owns just 1.1% of the exchange. Women and people of color have been hit hardest by mounting inequality; the average male-headed household gained four times as much wealth compared to the average female-led home. The fortunes of white households were bolstered 7.2 times more than the average Black household, and 6.7 times higher than the typical Hispanic/Latino home. And despite making up one-third of the U.S. population, Black and Hispanic/Latino households only hold 5.8% of the country’s wealth. What’s worse, America’s wealth gap is only expected to grow wider, the report warns, thanks to the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill, job scarcity, and an impending recession. History seems to be repeating itself; the wealthiest 0.0001% control a greater share of wealth than in the Gilded Age, according to the report. Billionaires have become king in America, and the new administration is passing legislation to safeguard their fortunes. “The Trump administration risks exponentially accelerating some of the worst trends of the past 45 years,” the Oxfam study notes, “having already overseen in less than one year a massively regressive tax reform, major cuts to the social safety net, and significant rollbacks for worker’s rights.” President Trump passed his One Big Beautiful Bill this July, which entails reducing the tax bill of the top 0.1% of earners in the country. By 2027, it’s expected that the statute will shave $311,000 off the tax costs of the ultra-rich, while the poorest Americans—making less than $15,000 annually—will be forced to pay even more in taxes. Among the 10 largest economies in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. is ranked second-to-last in using its tax and transfer system to fight inequality. In that cohort, America also has the highest rate of relative poverty. While America is home to more billionaires than any other country in the world, the average U.S. citizen isn’t getting a slice of the monumental economic success. Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandi, told Fortune last month that lower-income households are “hanging on by their fingertips financially.” Cost of living is raging, high-paying job opportunities are scarce, and layoffs are on the rise. To add fuel to the fire, America is descending into a recession; and 22 U.S. states are already seeing their economies contract, putting tight finances on the line. “The grip feels more tenuous because no one’s getting hired. You can sustain that for a while, but you can’t sustain that forever. If the layoffs do pick up, that lower-middle-income group is gonna get nailed—and they have no options,” Zandi said. “They have debt: They have auto debt, they have student loan debt, they may, if they’re lucky, have a mortgage, but they’re gonna struggle, and their world is going to descend into recession pretty quickly.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Goldman Sachs’ CEO debunks AI job replacement hysteria because he says humans will adapt like they always do: ‘Our economy is very nimble’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential and storied Wall Street firms, isn’t convinced an AI jobs apocalypse is on its way. In an interview with CNN, Solomon questioned the impact of the AI-linked layoffs that have recently caused widespread anxiety, from average job seekers to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While technological change may be moving faster than usual, we’ve seen this story before, the CEO said. “There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.” The most recent of these AI-linked layoffs arguably includes the 14,000 employees cut by Amazon last week. During the company’s quarterly earnings call that week, CEO Andy Jassy said the job cuts were “not even really AI-driven, not right now at least.” Still, Jassy earlier this year warned Amazon will not need as many employees in the future thanks to AI efficiency gains. Other AI-linked layoffs include those at Meta, which cut 600 jobs in its AI division, as well as Salesforce, which cut thousands of customer-service jobs in favor of AI agents. Finally, Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs earlier this year; CEO Satya Nadella said the company will add jobs in the future, but “with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI.” While many of these layoffs have grabbed headlines, a survey of Goldman Sachs investment bankers last week found only 11% of clients are actively cutting jobs because of AI. But the same survey found companies’ adoption of AI tools in their main business processes is heating up. The investment bankers found 37% of their clients, which span industries like real estate, tech, and finance, are using the technology for regular production. In the next year, the bankers expect more than half of their clients will follow suit, and in three years’ time, 74% of them will be incorporating AI into their businesses. Solomon, for his part, claims corporate AI implementation may mean fewer white-collar jobs, but said these positions will be picked up in other parts of the economy. Still, Solomon said the growing enthusiasm for AI could be a double-edged sword for the economy. While he has previously stopped short of calling the recent AI market exuberance a “bubble,” he warned that just like in previous waves of technological change, not everyone will come out winning. “The technology is exciting—there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) delivered a massive earnings beat this morning, but the stock is selling off in premarket trading anyway. That’s the tension worth watching right now. Uber reported Q3 earnings this morning with EPS of $1.20, crushing the $0.70 consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $13.47 billion, missing expectations of $13.54 billion by $70 million. The stock declined 9% in premarket trading to $92.25, suggesting investors are focusing more on the revenue shortfall and guidance implications than the headline EPS surprise. Trips and Bookings Drive the Momentum The real story here is operational velocity. Gross bookings reached $49.74 billion, up 21% year over year. Trips increased 22% YoY, marking what CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called “one of the largest trip-volume increases in the company’s history.” Monthly active platform consumers grew 17% YoY, indicating consistent user expansion across the platform. Both segments showed strength. Mobility revenue hit $7.68 billion, up 20%, while Delivery revenue jumped to $4.48 billion, up 29%. Adjusted EBITDA expanded 33% YoY to $2.26 billion. Free cash flow reached $2.23 billion, a signal that profitability is translating into real cash generation, not just accounting improvements. The $70 million revenue miss is modest in absolute terms but meaningful in context. With gross bookings accelerating and trips surging, you’d expect revenue to track higher. The gap suggests either mix headwinds (lower-margin business growing faster) or pricing pressure in core markets. I’d keep an eye on this during the earnings call. What’s not in doubt is margin expansion. Operating income hit $1.11 billion, and net income reached $6.63 billion. That includes a $4.9 billion tax valuation release benefit, so strip that out and the underlying profitability picture is still strong. EPS: $1.20 (vs. $0.70 expected)Revenue: $13.47B (vs. $13.54B expected); miss by $70MGross Bookings: $49.74B (vs. implied ~$48.7B); up 21% YoYAdjusted EBITDA: $2.26B (up 33% YoY)Free Cash Flow: $2.23BTrips: Up 22% YoYMonthly Active Platform Consumers: Up 17% YoY The adjusted EBITDA growth outpacing revenue growth shows operational leverage kicking in. That’s the metric that justifies the current valuation multiple. For Q4 2025, management guided for gross bookings of $52.25 billion to $53.75 billion, representing 17% to 21% YoY growth on constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.41 billion to $2.51 billion implies 31% to 36% YoY growth. The company also noted a 1 percentage point currency tailwind expected to boost Q4 growth. The guidance range suggests confidence, though the revenue miss today tempers enthusiasm slightly. Khosrowshahi’s commentary leaned bullish, emphasizing investments in “lifelong customer relationships,” local commerce expansion, and AI and autonomous vehicle potential. The tone was optimistic but not reckless. You’ll want to listen for clarity on the revenue miss. Was it mix shift, pricing pressure, or timing? Also watch for any commentary on competitive dynamics in core markets and how the company plans to sustain delivery growth, which is now outpacing mobility on a percentage basis. The path to $108.88 (current analyst price target) depends on whether margin expansion continues without sacrificing volume.

Title: Denny's to go private in $620 million deal for the 72-year-old breakfast chain

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 4, 2025 / 10:59 AM EST / CBS/AP Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors. The deal, announced Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises. Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday. Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading. Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus. Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box. Treville Capital is an investment firm whose chairman is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and former president of the Walt Disney Co. Denny's reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. Valade said Denny's board believed the deal announced Monday was in the best interest of shareholders and the best path forward for the company. "Denny's is an iconic piece of the American dream, with a renowned brand, a strong franchise base and loyal customers," said Rohit Manocha, co-founder at TriArtisan, in the statement. Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022. If approved by Denny's shareholders, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage.

Blackrock diving tower, Galway Friday, 3 October Met Éireann has revealed that Storm Amy led to an October record for wind speed in Donegal. Malin Head, Donegal recorded its highest October 10-minute mean wind speed in 65 years at 111kmh. The storm brought widespread wet and very windy weather on Friday 3rd and Saturday 4th as it passed close to the northwest coast of Ireland moving towards northern Scotland. The highest gust recorded was 148kmh and Donegal had been issued a red warning ahead of the violent gusts. There were higher than usual temperatures recorded for October and rainfall was also well above average. As Amy pulled away on Sunday, October 5, high pressure built over the country from the south, which brought calmer weather. The following two weeks stayed mild and mostly dry, apart from patches of light rain or drizzle at times, but it was disappointingly cloudy. There were a few sunny breaks, mostly in the southwest. Later in the month, low pressure returned with plenty of rain crossing the country bringing heavy falls of rain or showers at times, in between short dry periods. All mean air temperatures across the country were above their long-term average for the month. The national mean air temperature of 11.61C placed October 2025 as the 24th warmest in 126 years, but the coolest since 2020. The month’s highest temperature of 19.7C was reported at three stations, Shannon Airport, Co Clare, Phoenix Park in Dublin and Dublin Airport. The peak in temperatures points to a larger trend that has been emerging, with four of the top ten warmest Octobers having occurred since 2001. None of the top 10 coolest Octobers have occurred since 2001. Storm Amy brought violent storm-force winds in early October. Tens of thousands of properties were left without power as strong winds caused chaos and more than 100 flights were across the country. Blackrock diving tower, Galway Friday, 3 October Today's News in 90 Seconds - Tuesday, November 4 The highest 10-minute mean wind speed was recorded at 111kmh on Friday, October 3, at Malin Head, Co Donegal. Meanwhile, a gust of 148km/h was also recorded that day, the month’s highest gust. October was a dull month right across the country, with record low October sunshine at Malin Head and Casement Aerodrome, Co Dublin. In particular, Malin Head recorded its dullest October on record and the dullest October on record at any station. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

November 04, 2025 09:31 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 4 November 2025 – On 30 October 2025, Novo Nordisk announced the submission of an unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera, Inc. (Metsera)1. Today, Novo Nordisk confirms that it has submitted an updated, unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera. The updated proposal has been declared superior by Metsera’s board of directors. The acquisition of Metsera, including its early and development-stage incretin and non-incretin analogue peptide programmes, would provide Novo Nordisk the opportunity to maximise the potential of Metsera’s complementary portfolio and capabilities. An acquisition would be in line with Novo Nordisk’s long-term strategy of developing innovative and differentiated medicines and treating millions more people living with obesity and diabetes and their associated comorbidities. About the updated proposal Under the terms of the proposal, Novo Nordisk would acquire all outstanding shares of Metsera’s common stock at a price of 62.20 USD per share in cash (equal to an approximate aggregated equity value of 7.2 billion USD or approximate enterprise value of 6.7 billion USD) and contingent value rights (CVRs) for up to 24.00 USD per share in cash (or an approximate aggregated value of up to 2.8 billion USD) based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. The cash consideration will be paid at signing in exchange for non-voting preferred stock representing 50% of Metsera’s share capital and the CVRs will be issued upon the closing of the acquisition in exchange for the remaining shares. Novo Nordisk believes that the proposal, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the best interest of patients who will benefit from our commitment to innovation, as well as Metsera’s shareholders. This offer highlights Novo Nordisk’s commitment to investing in the US and interest in continuing to grow the scale of its US investments.

Under the terms of the Pfizer agreement, Pfizer has the right to negotiate with Metsera adjustments to the Pfizer agreement so that our proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal. Following this negotiation period, if Metsera’s board of directors concludes that the Novo Nordisk proposal continues to be a superior proposal, Metsera would be entitled to terminate the Pfizer agreement and enter into a binding agreement with Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes.

Title: Wall Street is suddenly sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations as Palantir tumbles

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AI trade is taking a hit on Tuesday. The sell-off in high-growth tech stocks accelerated late in the session, dragging major indexes lower on fears about valuations touching unsustainable levels. Concerns about equity valuations intensified on Tuesday after Palantir stock tumbled following its third-quarter earnings report, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. The AI software giant beat estimates for the last three-month period, pulling $1.18 billion in revenue, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. But shares were down as much as 9%. Other leaders in the AI trade sold off in tandem, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down nearly 2%. The 10-year Treasury yield was down two basis points to trade around 4.08%. Here's where major indexes stood around 3:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday: S&P 500: 6,771.90, down 1.17% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 47,029.06, down 0.65% (-307.62 points) Nasdaq Composite: 23,379.36, down 1.91% Other big tech stocks selling off on Tuesday include: Doubts are swirling around whether some companies have seen valuations go too far too fast, and whether firms will be able to deliver on their AI ambitions after spending billions on the technology. Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio hovered around 240x Tuesday morning. That compares to Nvidia, which has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 29. Also weighing on sentiment on Tuesday were comments from top banking executives, who said that the risk of a market correction is rising. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon both pointed to risks that the market could see a correction of up to 20%. Pick, however, added that he didn't see this as a negative event necessarily. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," he said at the Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit in Hong Kong. Markets have also been uneasy about the return on investment on AI so far, JPMorgan's Market Intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. Analyst said that clients have been concerned about narrow market breadth, adding that "there is a global risk off tone." The endless hype around the technology itself might also be starting to wane. "Some are doubting whether AI can possibly live up to the hype in terms of future returns," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Tuesday's sell-off. The AI trade has flashed other warning signs in recent weeks. Shares of Meta and Microsoft tumbled after the firms said they would boost capex spending plans, a sign investors are growing skeptical over the buckets of cash being poured into AI. Meanwhile, "The Big Short" investor Michael Burry recently revealed a bet against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday, adding to the selling pressure in the tech sector. It isn't the first round of volatility for Palantir, which plummeted around 40% from its early-year peak through April amid the broader market selloff. Shares declined another 18% from mid-August through their low in September after the short-seller Andrew Left said he was taking a bet against the company. This all comes at a time when the market is also waking up to the reality that more rate cuts might not be a sure thing. Jerome Powell said exactly that at the Fed's October meeting last week, and the outlook has grown muddled, especially as the government shutdown forces markets to operate in a data blackout. Jump to

Title: Wall Street's Biggest IREN Bull Hiked Price Target to $142 After $9.7B Microsoft AI Deal

Wall Street continues to try and stay ahead of the hot-handed IREN (IREN) after yesterday's $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to supply 200 megawatts (MW) of AI data center capacity. The company's biggest sell-side fan is Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch. Bullish on the stock this past summer when it was trading for $10 and continually hiking his price target since, Knoblauch yesterday raised again, this time to $142 from $100. That implies more than a 100% upside from yesterday's close of $67.75. Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, meanwhile, said the deal with MSFT cements IREN's position as one of the few infrastructure players owning its own power assets. He hiked his IREN price target to $125 from $75 and reiterated its outperform rating. The pact could generate $2 billion in annual recurring AI cloud revenue for IREN by 2027, on top of roughly $500 million from existing operations, Chhugani said. Unlike competitors such as CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), IREN’s 2.9 gigawatt (GW) portfolio allows it to expand in line with demand without relying on co-location partners, a structure which will boost profitability, Chhugani continued. Chhugani now forecasts $2.5 billion in AI cloud revenue by 2027, up from $1.1 billion previously, and values IREN’s Sweetwater site at $5 million per megawatt, based on recent M&A multiples. Further, the Microsoft deal taps only about 10% of IREN’s total power capacity across British Columbia and Texas, leaving scope to scale further with Microsoft or other hyperscalers. Roth Capital has also lifted its price target to $94 from $82. Shares are lower by nearly 5% early Tuesday alongside a general swoon in markets, with Nasdaq futures down 1.5% and bitcoin threatening to tumble below $100,000 level.

Title: Elon Musk's $1.5 trillion Tesla pay deal set to be rejected by Norway wealth fund

Please let us know Topic:Business, Economics and Finance Elon Musk could receive a $US1 trillion compensation package if Tesla investors approve it later this week. (Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes) Norway's sovereign wealth fund says it will vote against a proposed $1.5 trillion pay deal to Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. The world's largest sovereign wealth fund holds the seventh-biggest stake in the electric car maker, and is so far the biggest shareholder to say how it plans to vote. Opponents of the pay deal face an uphill battle to stop Mr Musk's proposed compensation package, which will be formally voted on on November 6. Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has announced it will vote against ratifying Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's proposed compensation package that is potentially worth $US1 trillion ($1.54 trillion) at an annual general meeting later this week. Investors in the electric vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever chief executive compensation agreement. Critics have called the pay deal excessive but face an uphill fight against it. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with chair Robyn Denholm warning that Mr Musk could leave the $1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected. Opponents worry that it will give the world's richest man too much unchecked power. Mr Musk's new trillion-dollar pay package will almost certainly pass, given broad investor support. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, also allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him some 13.5 per cent of voting power. Elon Musk became CEO of electric car company Tesla in October 2008. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The Norwegian wealth fund is the largest investor so far to say how it plans to vote. The next largest to do so, Baron Capital, plans to back Mr Musk's pay package. Tesla's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's net worth hit $US500 billion ($755 billion) on Wednesday, the "Real-Time Billionaires" tracker reported. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Mr Musk's compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, deliver high payouts even if the chief executive only met some goals and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Both also opposed a shareholder vote last year on a 2018 $56 billion package for Mr Musk that passed with overwhelming support from Tesla's army of mum-and-dad investors. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Mr Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12 per cent stake worth $17 billion, also voted "no" to Mr Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. NBIM on Tuesday also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for re-election, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis, while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Mr Musk. Tesla says its chief executive would earn "nothing" unless the company's market value grew substantially and that the maximum award would only be paid if the group reached several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase.

Title: Amazon cancels what could have been the biggest Lord of the Rings video game ever
URL: https://winteriscoming.net/amazon-cancels-what-could-have-been-the-biggest-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-ever
Time Published: 2025-11-04T14:00:01Z

Those awaiting the next big Lord of the Rings game are in for a disappointment, as Amazon has axed what promised to be a very exciting new adventure in Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings has given fans a plethora of fun video games over the years. Whether based on Peter Jacksonâs iconic trilogy or tied into the original books, a great Lord of the Rings game lets gamers enjoy the experience of Middle-earth in a variety of eras.Â One upcoming project that had fans excited was a reported Amazon Game Studios MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) that was untitled but set to expand on this world. This seemed the perfect concept as MMORPGs are a mainstay for fantasy fans such as Warcraft. So one based on the most iconic fantasy tale ever should be a hit, right? Sadly, it appears itâs not happening, as former Amazon Games engineer Ashleigh Amrine shared on social media that she was part of a huge round of layoffs at the company that also appears to have ended production on its upcoming Lord of the Rings video game. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she wrote. There wasn't much word on the details of the game other than it would allow players to span the events of both The Hobbit and the main Lord of the Rings trilogy. Itâs part of Amazon doing widespread layoffs, eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. Thatâs a blow to LOTR fans that adds to the complex history of this game.Â The winding road to a Lord of the Rings MMORPG rivals the quest to take the One Ring into Mordor.Â There had been a good entry made in 2007 with The Lord of the Rings Online, which is still running 17 years later and has been given numerous updates. But Amazon has been trying to move in on that space with an even more ambitious project, and it seems to be struggling to pull it off.Â Due to how complex a MMORPG can be to set up and maintain, creating one that brings the world of Tolkien to life is a challenge. In 2019, Amazon announced plans for a game by the Orange County team who would later craft the successful 2021 game New World and a partnership with Chinese company Leyou. In just two years, that title was canceled after Leyou was acquired by Tencent. In 2023, Amazon announced they were returning to the idea with the Embracer Group. In 2024, Amazon Games CEO Christoph Hartmann gave an update to fans.Â "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over. While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing that is different from all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.â Sadly, any plans are now undone by these massive layoffs. Itâs a blow to fans of the property and the games themselves. The last major Lord of the Rings game was 2023âs Gollum, which was slammed by both fans and reviewers as probably the worst LOTR game ever.Â The Lord of the Rings Online game is fun in how it allows players to craft a character of a certain class for adventures. Yet it has been showing its age in its updates and a brand new MMORPG utilizing today's advanced technology could have been a hit. Having gamers able to experience the events of the movies would have been the icing on the cake. Thereâs a chance the project could live on in some sort of form, yet the outcome doesnât look good. The gaming industry has been affected over the last few years by corporate attrition with numerous studios shuttered and countless games canceled. So for those hoping for another fantastic MMORPG set in Middle-earth, that quest seems to be over for now.Â

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock should be added to your watch list.

Over the past decade, Adobe stock attracted buying interest at this level 7 times and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 40.2%. The stock has been beaten down, falling close to 23% year-to-date, due to intensifying competition from AI-powered creative tools and investor concerns about Adobe’s high subscription fees amid rising alternatives. However, is the price movement sufficient by itself? Fundamental analysis is also essential. For ADBE Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to evaluate the strength of this buying opportunity.

Title: 5 Best Mutual Funds To Buy In 2026 For Growth, Income And Diversification
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-mutual-funds-buy-2026/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T13:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Looking for the best mutual funds to buy in 2026? As markets shift and volatility remains high, choosing the right funds is key to balancing growth income and diversification. These five mutual funds stand out for their performance, reasonable expense ratios and strong management — offering investors reliable options for the year ahead. Mutual funds provide investors with professional portfolio management without picking individual stocks. They deliver instant diversification, spreading risk across dozens — or even hundreds — of holdings, which cushions portfolios against market volatility. Most funds maintain low minimum investments and allow automatic dividend reinvestment, helping returns compound over time. For investors seeking steady growth or income in a volatile market, mutual funds offer a practical, low-maintenance solution. The five mutual funds highlighted here were chosen based on key performance and cost criteria: Together, these metrics point to funds with consistent management quality, solid fundamentals and sustainable long-term potential. The following five mutual funds represent diverse approaches to wealth building, from international value opportunities to domestic equity strategies. Each brings unique strengths that could benefit different types of investors depending on their goals, risk tolerance and existing portfolio composition. This international value fund focuses on undervalued companies outside the U.S., following a classic value-investing strategy. It seeks businesses trading below intrinsic value with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. With an 8.25% forward dividend yield, TBGVX is ideal for investors seeking income and capital appreciation. Its disciplined approach to international markets and diversification makes it a standout in global equity portfolios, even with a higher expense ratio. The International Vector Equity Portfolio uses a systematic, factor-based international equity strategy, focusing on small-cap and value stocks across developed markets. By holding thousands of positions, the fund ensures broad diversification and reduces company-specific risk. DFVQX delivers strong historical returns with a remarkably low expense ratio, allowing investors’ money to compound efficiently. Its evidence-based strategy suits cost-conscious investors seeking international exposure. OWSMX invests in small and mid-cap U.S. companies with strong growth prospects. Holding 40–60 stocks allows for focused research and active portfolio management, helping investors capture the small-cap premium. Small-cap stocks are positioned for a potential rebound after years of underperformance versus large caps. With nearly $9 billion in assets and flexible positioning, OWSMX provides targeted exposure to this overlooked segment of the market. The Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund invests in dividend-paying stocks across all market caps, emphasizing sustainable payout ratios. The fund balances income generation with long-term capital growth. VSEQX offers a 10.10% forward yield — exceptional for an equity fund — and an ultra-low expense ratio, ensuring investors keep more returns. For those seeking dividend income alongside growth, this fund provides one of the strongest combinations of yield, quality, and cost efficiency. The BlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund combines a diversified equity portfolio with an options overlay. By writing covered calls, the fund generates additional income while limiting volatility. XCIIX delivers a 7.13% yield with consistent multi-year performance. Its enhanced income strategy balances risk management with equity exposure, appealing to investors seeking stability and income in 2026. These five mutual funds provide clear paths to build wealth in 2026 — from international value to dividend income to small-cap growth. Each fund combines experienced management, reasonable fees and strong historical performance. While past performance does not guarantee future results, these funds are well-positioned for investors seeking diversification, income, and growth potential. Evaluate how each aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance and portfolio strategy before investing.

Title: Kelleher eyes cup win to keep 'special journey' going

It's close to a decade since Fiacre Kelleher left Ireland to join Celtic. And while he did not make his mark with the Bhoys, stints at a number of English League clubs followed. And now he's back home. On Sunday next he will lead out Cork City against Shamrock Rovers in the Sports Direct FAI Cup final. Kelleher, no doubt echoing the views of many, sees it as a "David v Goliath" clash. The Premier Division champions against the side who propped up the table, with relegation for the Leesiders confirmed a few weeks out from the season's end. But speaking to RTÉ Sport in advance of the Aviva Stadium showpiece, the 29-year-old does not accept that Goliath will have it all their own way, and said: "We play this fixture ten times and Rovers will probably win nine times. "But like the rest of the Cork City fans travelling up on the day, we are full of hope, it's a one-off and we will fancy our chances. If we're at our best and have a little bit of luck on our side, the day can be ours. Hopefully." Getting to a cup final has softened the blow of a third relegation in six seasons for Cork, a renewed focus for all involved, with Kelleher adding: "It has given us all something to look forward to, something that the club needed and us as players needed after the relegation. It has come at a good time, the guns are firing and we are ready to go for Sunday. "Seani (Maguire) has been telling us how big a day it is and how enjoyable it can be for us and our families. The realisation of how big an occasion it actually is really dawning on me now and we need this to be a big day for us." After a season with Celtic and then a year on loan at Peterhead, Kelleher's career took him south where he had spells at eight different clubs. He was there when Ryan Reynolds and co brought a touch of Hollywood to Wrexham and more cash. As he put it himself they were then able to "afford players that were more experienced than me". His final season in England saw a promotion push that fell just short with Colchester in League Two. In June of this year, the Blackrock native signed a long-term deal with the Turner's Cross outfit. And Kelleher still feels he has lot more to give. "It's not done yet," he boasts. More chapters to follow after what has gone before. "It's been crazy, magical, all sorts. I've seen everything. I've played down in the lower divisions and have met all sorts of characters. It has been special, my own journey, one that I have enjoyed. I'm still incredibly proud that I get to play football every day and it's something that I really don't want to give up, even though some day it will happen. "Coming home and playing with my home club is extra special and to top it off you get to play in a big final." One man who will not be present at the Dublin 4 venue on Sunday owing to his presence between the posts for Brentford in the Premier League will be Kelleher's brother Caoimhín. The older sibling very much in awe of what the latter has achieved so far in his career. "I don't think anybody is as laid back as him. I'm a bit more emotional and intense and that's why he is so good, he can keep it under wraps. "He is nothing but full of support for me. He's gutted he can't be there because he plays on Sunday. "It's probably something we don't appreciate at the moment. He does all these special things; it's one thing after another, he just keeps topping it. "In a few years when he's done we will then only realise what a special career he has had. I mean, what a special career he has had all ready. "I took my own little boy over to his first Brentford game against Manchester City. It's incredible, to have my own brother who has played for Liverpool and is now a No 1 goalkeeper in the Premier League is special." Taking his place at the heart of the Cork City defence, Kelleher will be tasked with keeping tabs on those who will provide the firepower for Shamrock Rovers. It's a big task, but much homework has been done by Ger Nash and his backroom team on how the Hoops' threat can be quelled, with Kelleher saying: "We've done a lot of prep. The relegation came a few weeks ago, which was difficult. "In the week or two after it has given us enough time to focus on this fixture, to focus on our preparation, on their threats and on how they might hurt us. "I feel I'm more than prepared to deal with the likes of Burke (Graham) Gaffney (Rory) and Mandroiu (Danny), all those wonderful players. On the day anything is possible and we do fancy ourselves."

Title: OpenAI’s $1T IPO: a Split from Nvidia’s Costly AI Dominance?

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a landmark initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The filing could come as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential listing by 2027, as OpenAI looks to expand beyond its private funding base and tap public markets for growth capital. The move follows a corporate restructuring that established the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and reduced Microsoft’s ownership to around 27%, giving Sam Altman’s company greater strategic and operational independence. This IPO represents more than just a record-breaking valuation; it marks the beginning of OpenAI’s next phase of industrial growth. With rising compute demands and a heavy reliance on Nvidia’s hardware, the company is seeking record amounts of new capital to build its own energy-efficient infrastructure and diversify its chip supply chain. As OpenAI prepares for its public listing, the company is also redefining its financial and business structure to support the next phase of growth. Its restructuring and forthcoming IPO represent the foundation of a long-term strategy: to create the resources, autonomy, and scale needed to lead the next era of intelligent computing in a way that makes sense for investors. In essence, OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO isn’t just about valuation: it’s about taking the steps to make it more market-friendly, enabling the kind of financial scaling that makes sense for a new entrant to the Mag 7, one who wants to dictate the future of artificial intelligence. In recent weeks, OpenAI completed a sweeping corporate restructuring that established the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit entity designed to anchor the company’s mission around the safe and ethical development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The Foundation now holds a 26% equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, a public benefit corporation structured to balance two often competing forces, namely mission oversight and capital flexibility. At the same time, Microsoft’s ownership has been reduced to around 27%, signaling OpenAI’s clear intent to lessen its dependence on a single strategic partner and broaden its governance base. This new hybrid corporate structure provides OpenAI with the flexibility to raise capital from public markets while maintaining its nonprofit influence at the board level. This change invites a key question: how will OpenAI reconcile the commercial pressures of a trillion-dollar enterprise with its foundational commitment to developing AGI safely and responsibly? CEO Sam Altman’s vision for OpenAI will require massive investment, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, to expand compute capacity and secure reliable renewable energy sources. Looking ahead, OpenAI may also develop its own custom AI chips to reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia and strengthen control over its hardware stack. It’s an ambitious step, but one that could be essential to sustaining the race toward AGI. An IPO would provide OpenAI with the capital it needs to accelerate its long-term vision, while also rewarding major early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. With revenues projected to reach $20 billion but losses climbing due to the soaring cost of Nvidia hardware, going public is both a strategic necessity and a natural next step. Ultimately, OpenAI aims to build a vertically integrated AI economy—one that unites chips, compute, and energy into a self-sustaining industrial ecosystem capable of powering the next era of intelligent technology. As the IPO comes into view, one of the clearest signals from OpenAI’s next phase is a push to escape the cost and energy bottlenecks tied to its current hardware platform. The strategy centers on both reducing dependency on Nvidia’s GPU monopoly (and its rising costs), as well as improving efficiency in infrastructure built for AGI-scale demands. Nvidia’s GPUs remain the backbone of most AI training operations, including those of OpenAI. However, these GPUs come with steep costs and fast-growing energy demands. Supply-chain tightness and per-unit price increases have amplified these operating expenses, while US power grids strain under the scale of these large AI training clusters. Chinese competitors, such as DeepSeek, appear to be outpacing Nvidia’s GPUs in terms of energy efficiency. This highlights a strategic gap, and if OpenAI wants to scale successfully, it needs to address this gap. In fact, there are reports that the company is already buying up all the RAM it can, some saying it accounts for 40% of the global DRAM demand. Since supply can’t possibly keep up, this has had an unfortunate effect of pushing prices to historical highs: anyone looking to buy RAM right now will have to reckon with a 171% year-on-year increase in the price tag. This October, OpenAI entered into a multi-gigawatt deal with AMD (Instinct MI450 and future generations), on track for a 1 GW deployment in the second half of 2026, and up to 6 GW over time. At the same time, the company is exploring Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and other accelerator platforms to further diversify its compute stack – and, ideally, optimize its energy costs. The shift toward a more varied compute ecosystem could increase OpenAI’s GFLOPS per watt, while reducing its cost per watt and mitigating its supplier risk. Overall, it could position OpenAI as a more resilient infrastructure player, not just an LLM model operator. OpenAI’s IPO may be the culmination of one wave – and the spark of the next. As infrastructure, software, and energy converge, companies moving into publicly traded markets could redefine how investors access the growing AI narrative. AI stocks are surging – and have been for much of the last two years. Nvidia recently reached a whopping $5T market capitalization: a historic milestone not just in the tech sector, but for any company. And it doesn’t look like the growth’s going to stop there. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang claimed the company is looking at a $500B worth of AI chip orders in 2026, which sparked number of analysts to claim that this kind revenue would mean the stock still has a lot of upside to it. CoreWeave, an AI-infrastructure provider, has seen its share prices rise rapidly since its IPO in March, currently trading at $126 – over three times its price at launch. If OpenAI’s IPO unfolds smoothly, it could ignite the next wave of AI investment, positioning the company as the software counterpart to Nvidia’s hardware dominance. Together, they would represent a kind of “completion” of the AI ecosystem that investors have long been anticipating. OpenAI’s public debut would likely act as a catalyst for competition among chipmakers, cloud providers, and energy firms, all racing to deliver the lowest cost per watt for AGI-scale compute. This global reshuffling echoes broader geopolitical dynamics, as nations like Saudi Arabia pursue ambitious AI strategies positioned between U.S. and Chinese interests, leveraging their energy resources to become major players in the next era of artificial intelligence. The core of the AI space may see a shift away from Nvidia – today’s GPU supply’s dominant force – and toward vertically integrated ecosystem players with hardware, compute, and energy in-house. At the very least, that’s what OpenAI envisions. OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO could mark a defining moment in its evolution, from a research pioneer to one of the most successful SaaS, and finally a full-scale industrial powerhouse. Yet the move raises a critical question: can a publicly traded company truly uphold its mission of “safe AGI” when market expectations demand relentless growth? The debate over ethical AI is intensifying across industries, from corporations pursuing AGI to governments deploying AI for surveillance, as seen in ICE’s use of AI to monitor social media activity. As OpenAI channels public capital into more efficient hardware and energy systems, it faces the complex challenge of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. If successful, the company could not only lessen its dependence on Nvidia but also redefine what true AI leadership means, measured not just by model intelligence but by efficiency, autonomy, and the ability to balance moral restraint with profit.

Title: Tylenol to join Kleenex, Huggies and Listerine in $48.7 billion takeover deal between Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/04/tylenol-takeover-kimberly-clark-kenvue-48-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:47:11Z
Full Content:
Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue’s stock jumped 12% Monday afternoon, while shares of Kimberly-Clark, based outside of Dallas, slumped by nearly 15%. Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive … especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger. Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Norway wealth fund says it will vote against Musk's $1 trillion Tesla pay package

Business A Tesla logo is seen at a Tesla showroom in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song OSLO / BOSTON :Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Tesla's sixth-largest outside investor, said on Tuesday it would vote against ratifying a proposed pay deal for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion. Musk's pay package is still seen as likely to win, given broad investor support in the past and the backing Tesla enjoys from its large retail shareholder base. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him 15.3 per cent of voting power including restricted stock granted in August. The opposition from stewardship-minded Norges Bank Investment Management was no surprise. But its direct criticism of the compensation and planned votes against two Tesla board directors add uncertainty to the outcome of a ballot set for Thursday, corporate governance experts said, and underscore how other European investors may also turn against the electric-vehicle maker.

Loading Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning that Musk could leave the $1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected."European voters are much more likely to be swayed by where Norges goes, because of the general support of ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles and concerns into their investment philosophy," said Francis Byrd, a partner at consulting firm Alchemy Strategies Partners.Byrd and several other consultants said they expect Tesla's recommendations to prevail at the meeting, since top investors have stuck with him so far.

Business A Tesla logo is seen at a Tesla showroom in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song OSLO / BOSTON :Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Tesla's sixth-largest outside investor, said on Tuesday it would vote against ratifying a proposed pay deal for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion. Musk's pay package is still seen as likely to win, given broad investor support in the past and the backing Tesla enjoys from its large retail shareholder base. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him 15.3 per cent of voting power including restricted stock granted in August. The opposition from stewardship-minded Norges Bank Investment Management was no surprise. But its direct criticism of the compensation and planned votes against two Tesla board directors add uncertainty to the outcome of a ballot set for Thursday, corporate governance experts said, and underscore how other European investors may also turn against the electric-vehicle maker.

Title: Wall Street Journal Insults Reader Intelligence, Depicts Lenders as Addressing Loan Risks When That Horse Has Left the Barn and Is in the Next County

Seriously, how dumb does the Wall Street Journal think its readers are? Or does the abject lameness and stenography-taking manifested in its lead story, Wall Street Intensifies Scrutiny of Fraud After Spate of Loan Losses, instead reflect lack of competence on its reporting staff? Now admittedly this piece is fuzzy on timing, which again may reflect, erm, artful drafting or lack of attentiveness. But it reads as intended to reassure investors about loan standards. Indeed, the industry is going through one of those periodic Come to Jesus1 moments when it gets serious about loan standards after a string of losses and even resulting crises. But getting religion now does nothing to cure past sins. And they are legion. The elephant in the room, which this article ignores, is the wide-spread practice of making “cov-lite” loans, as in ones with minimal or even no covenants. Particularly with risky borrowers, sound practice requires imposing covenants, as in post-loan issuance requirements, such as keeping certain minimum net worth, asset and interest coverage levels, and financial disclosures. Mind you, the last time I read covenants was in the 1980s, when they were taken seriously. Then, breaching covenants gave the lenders the right to accelerate the loan, as in demand all future interest and principal payments immediately.2 That would result in bankruptcy in pretty much all cases. But that threat is a potent weapon, allowing lenders to demand more information, force a restructuring if they find real problems, and perhaps also replace key top executives. Needless to say, cov-lite lending become widespread when memories of past excesses fade and investors are reaching for returns, meaning too much demand for higher-yield paper gives borrowers more power than they ought to have. The protracted post-crisis period of negative real interest rates was destined to drive investors into riskier assets. We’ve been linking to mentions of cov-lite lending for years. There was no point then in inveighing against it since lenders could not be protected from their greed. A quick search shows how long this sort of thing has been going on. Some examples from a search with a date range of 2010 to 2020: The reemergence of cov-lite loans Financial Times ‘Cov-lite’ loans soar in dash for yield Financial Times, 2013 Leveraged loans are way past “cov-lite” Financial Times, 2018 Cov-lite loans: the new normal, but at what cost? Hermes [highly regarded UK pension fund manager], 2019 This tweet gives an idea of the extent and implications of this practice. Cov-lite loans, now 75% of private equity backed rated borrowers, gut essential financial oversight by ditching quarterly tests & meaningful covenants. Caveat Emptor for this obliterates early warning systems, letting PE firms plunder unchecked, prioritizing their profits over… pic.twitter.com/jLWJxjp1Rj — John E. Montana (@JohnEMontana) September 24, 2025 A sign that risk tolerance has reached dangerous levels was industry publications describing the revival of payment-in-kind loans. These are one that rather than pay all or any of the interest due in cash, that amount is added to the principal balance. The last time these were common was in the very last phase of the leveraged buyout boom, from 1987 to 1989. Asset manager TCW applies porcine maquillage in The Big PIK-ture: As a form of interest payment where interest is accrued by increasing the loan principal rather than paid in cash, PIK interest represents a nuanced tool within credit markets, particularly in the middle market private credit space….. Any private credit manager would agree: first lien senior secured lenders1 seldom prefer PIK interest as their primary form of interest payment. Cash interest payments provide immediate income and liquidity that are critical for many investors, particularly those focused on current income. Therefore, an increase in PIK interest – whether at the individual borrower level or across a portfolio – should prompt a thorough review of underlying credit fundamentals. The primary driver behind the recent growth in PIK interest has been the rapid normalization of interest rates. From 2022 through 2024, SOFR2 (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) rose sharply from near zero to a high of approximately 5.5%. (See Figure 1.) Since most middle market borrowers generally have floating-rate senior secured loans priced as a fixed spread over one- or three-month SOFR, this translated into a significant increase in cash interest expense owed by middle market borrowers. Since the end of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), many capital structures were constructed under the assumption of a persistently low interest rate environment, often near zero, and most borrowers and lenders didn’t anticipate such a rapid and sustained increase. As a result, borrowers with highly leveraged balance sheets faced increased debt service burdens that the underlying businesses were unable to sustain with free cash flow generation alone. In some cases, this led to liquidity crises, where cash flow generation from business operations was insufficient to meet scheduled principal and cash interest payments. Converting some, or all, cash interest to PIK allows borrowers to defer cash outflows, preserving liquidity to maintain operations, invest in growth, or execute turnaround plans. For lenders, PIK accrual increases the principal balance, preserving lenders’ contractual economics and potentially enhancing lenders’ recovery. PIK clearly isn’t the first choice for lenders and can be potentially value destroying for equity investors as well. Translation: even though the Fed has signaled since before the 2014 Taper Tantrum that it wanted to normalize interest rates, investors acted as it that was na ga happen on their watch. So lenders chose to allow stressed borrowers to pretend to stay current by allowing payment in kind. An alert reader might have said earlier, if these bad practices are so long standing, why have there not been more blow-ups? The PIK example shows that investors (as in actual fund investors not the fund manager) are being sold out to preserve the fiction that borrowers would not have defaulted. Other factors: One is that even though loan terms became more permissive, that does not necessarily mean all caution was thrown to the winds in terms of who got loans. There presumably was generally not-bad borrower due diligence before credit was extended. Second is that in a low interest rate environment with too much competition among lenders, some (many? most?) stressed borrowers could likely have refinanced before they got in real trouble. Third is that there has been a ton of stimulus, benefitting corporations more than individuals, which also would generally keep bad outcomes at bay. In the US, Covid relief was particularly business-friendly. Biden and Trump post Covid have kept up large fiscal deficits. So with this background, it’s easier to see the Journal parroting fund manager sleight-of-hand. The first part of this con is to depict the recent blow ups as the result of fraud, as opposed to long-standing lax lending standards resulting in a predictable crunch as the economy weakens and interest rates rise. Second is the pretense that lenders can do anything about outstanding loans. They can’t suddenly demand that borrowers make more disclosures than their credit agreements stipulated. These debtors are nearly all private companies, so transparency is limited. Even if they hire the business analogue to private investigators, such as so-called channel checkers like Gerson Lerhman to get a better grip on company performance, what do they do if they find something amiss? Absent an actual covenant breach, they can’t deploy the big hammer of payment acceleration. To the Journal’s spin: A string of alleged frauds by corporate borrowers is spurring a reckoning across Wall Street, sending bankers and investors scrambling to prevent future blowups. Lenders are increasing due diligence and demanding a longer history of financial data from companies. Some are inserting conditions that permit them to do more frequent checkups before agreeing to make loans. A group of the biggest names in banking, investment management and accounting have formed a task force that will take a deeper look at the nature of the problem and how to protect investors. The frauds that have emerged so far, which involve small to midsize companies in sectors such as autos and telecommunications, haven’t sparked widespread trouble in the market or economy. But they have generated fallout for both regional banks and Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, and the string of revelations has made it harder to dismiss any one case as an isolated event. Consistent with the headline, and the notably frequent use of the “f” word, lenders are supposed victims, as opposed to perps who handed out money on overly generous terms. Even though the first line does make the “alleged fraud” concession, the entire piece is framed around the idea that the only hazard is fraud, as opposed to marginal-at-best borrowers hitting the wall as the economy deteriorates. One does not have to look hard to find more balanced reporting. Bloomberg does focus on the fraud aspect in Credit Fraud Fears Loom After BlackRock’s HPS Zeros Out Bad Loan, if nothing else because BlackRock stuffed up so badly. But a few days ago, Bloomberg also warned of how more and more borrowers can’t service their debt in The Ranks of Corporate Zombies Are Growing. Key sections: The tally of “zombie companies” in the US that aren’t earning enough to cover their interest expenses stands at the highest since early 2022, with almost 100 gaining the designation in October. The main reason: Companies that gorged on debt at near-zero interest rates in the pandemic era have since been hurt by tariffs and higher funding costs. The odds of getting much relief on either front aren’t improving, with the US signing trade deals that lock in some of the higher tariffs and the Federal Reserve signaling that it might not continue to cut rates at its December meeting. Zombies will have to take steps to fix their balance sheets, such as boosting earnings or arranging costly new financing, or potentially face default. It won’t be easy. “Even if the Fed were continuing with cuts, the borrowing costs for small companies, zombie companies, are still multiples higher than historic averages,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “A lot of these companies were barely scraping by at zero rates.” Read that last sentence again. It is a terse indictment of the lending practices that are producing the current crunch. The UK’s This Is Money makes clear that the idea of taking comfort from the ideas that the distressed companies are mainly small and midsized. Remember the banks in the US savings and loan crisis individually were way below too big to fail status, yet collectively presented a systemic risk. From Lenders urged to come clean over loans to so-called ‘shadow banks’ on November 2: Some of Britain’s biggest lenders have been accused of failing to come clean about the full extent of loans to so-called ‘shadow banks’ as fears grow that a recent spate of corporate collapses in the US could trigger another global financial crisis. HSBC and Barclays were among big European banks accused of ‘very poor disclosure’ over how much money they have lent to this opaque part of the financial system, also known as the ‘non-bank’ lending market. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that ‘alarm bells’ are ringing after the collapse of sub-prime vehicle finance provider Tricolor and another US firm, car parts maker First Brands, earlier this year…. Shadow banks have become a vital source of funding for consumers and firms as big name lenders have retreated from riskier funding deals since the 2008 financial crisis. They promise higher returns for investors than the big banks, but lack transparency and are unregulated, meaning they don’t have to disclose financial details. Mainstream banks are exposed to this risk too as they lend direct to the shadow banks. A risky form of this lending, known as ‘private debt’, has expanded rapidly in recent years and is set to account for £2.1 trillion of all lending in 2029, up from £1.2 trillion last year…. …it [Barclays] declined to say how much it had lent to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) – a broader group of non-banks that include insurers, pension providers, private equity groups and hedge funds. NDFIs provide services similar to those of traditional banks but crucially do not take deposits from the general public and are not regulated as lenders. In a recent note, credit ratings agency Fitch warned that lending by these non-banks, while still niche, was becoming increasingly complex, meaning ‘a financial shock event could reveal unexpected transmission channels’ to the wider system. It risks creating a domino effect similar to the 2008 crash when a collapse in the US mortgage market spread to other parts of the banking sector through a web of interlocking deals and financial products. Mind you, this picture does not contain much evidence of the leverage on leverage which enabled the 2008 credit crunch to threaten to destroy the financial system. In January 2007, we cited Gillian Tett at the Financial Times describing the astonishing gearing driving the so-called “wall of liquidity.” But the flip side is the unwind of the massive Japanese real estate/stock market bubbles didn’t feature big blowups until 1997, years into its protracted zombification, due to the authorities loosening up a bit on the assumption recovery was starting to take hold just before the Asian crisis hit. So a gut-wrenching market upheaval is not necessary to have seriously bad debt overhang outcomes. Nevertheless, things are set to get worse before they get better. So take precautions if you can. ____ 1 I heard this expression often from a terrific Jewish lawyer. 2 Obviously there is A Process. I do not recall what percentage of lenders is required to notify a bond trustee (and I assume these lenders have a similar party in the mix) to trigger the process, or mere documentation of a breach by any lender suffices. I assume there is a notice process, and that the borrower is also given a limited amount of time in which to cure the breach. Another great post. Yes, the ‘f’ word is being bandied about by the increasing number of lenders being caught up in the Big Credit Squeezola. And now we have the ‘z’ word surfacing in a number of places. This ( Private capital zombie firms will pile up in next decade, says EQT chief ) from the FT two days ago. The mainstream financial press is nothing if not derivative. The zombie talk is entirely too charitable. Here we have private equity, or private credit if you will, engaging in a dictionary of extend and pretend…secondaries, PIK, cove-lite and the latest genius move…tertiaries. As you might expect tertiary investors are intended to, (indeed required) to pay off the secondary investors clamoring for their payday. Perhaps we need a new word to define this Mulligan stew of bad investment. How about the ‘p’ word. Nah! Ponzi would never appear on the paragon pages of Bloomberg or the Financial Times. in contemporary ‘golf speak’, a mulligan is a back-slapping practice…among certain factions, to enable an individual a do-over…usually for an aberrant tee shot. with reference to PE tertiaries squeezing secondary investors…in a credit crunch… can such an event be compared to the 2008 performance….as in privatize profits and socialize losses? As an aside, the manufacturing sector is the one being hit hardest by bankruptcies. 32% by mid 2025 if one goes by this heat map (page 7 of the document). I worked a stint for a venture capital company back in early 2008, before the great recession hit. The VC’s investment fund had a portfolio of debt investments owed to them by a variety of small and mid-sized companies, all of which had exorbitant interest rates. A substantial number of these loans were non-performing, where the contractually required payments of principal and interest were no longer being made by the borrower. The latest kill the finance guys were celebrating was a loan taken out by a new client company to finance the buyout of its retiring owner, with an interest rate of 24%. This loan was so incredibly big in relation to the company’s balance sheet that it stood less than a snowball’s chance in hell of surviving it. Apparently, a prerequisite for doing God’s work requires one to keep a safe distance away from both Christian morality and economic reality. Your email address will not be published.

What to Know: Bitcoin’s price remains above the critical $100,000 mark, consolidating near $103,700 after a brief pullback of over 3% in the past 24 hours. Despite short-term volatility, analysts point out that $BTC continues to trade around its 50-day trend average near $108K, suggesting the broader bullish trend remains intact. Institutional inflows have continued to pour into spot Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge toward the end of the year. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT recently surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform and became the largest venue for Bitcoin options globally, hitting almost $38 billion. These inflows have helped maintain market liquidity and reduced volatility as the crypto market is still dealing with the post-October crash aftermath. Several quantitative models predict that if $BTC sustains its support above $100K, a December 2025 peak between $135K and $140K remains on the cards. While Bitcoin’s price action dominates headlines, this growing institutional interest has reignited focus on Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling networks. These are solutions designed to enhance $BTC’s speed, interoperability, and functionality for decentralized finance. One of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a Layer-2 platform designed to make Bitcoin faster and more adaptable for modern DeFi applications. As Bitcoin pushes toward its forecasted $135K–$140K range by late 2025, the broader narrative around Bitcoin’s scalability will only intensify. Historically, Layer-2 ecosystems (from Ethereum’s Arbitrum to Polygon) have seen exponential growth following main-chain rallies. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could be next in line to capitalize on this pattern. It’s one of the best crypto presales of 2025, raising over $25.7M at the time of writing. Built as a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper will combine scalability, low transaction costs, and EVM compatibility, enabling developers to dApps that leverage Bitcoin’s security without facing its throughput limits (an average of 7 tps now). The project will use a Canonical Bridge to turn $BTC into wrapped $BTC. This will be used in the L2 ecosystem for dApps and other operations. And a Solana Virtual Machine will speed up transactions to exponentially more than Bitcoin’s current capacity. Transaction settlement will happen on Bitcoin’s Layer-1, which ensures absolute security for peace of mind. This hybrid model allows Bitcoin to become a true DeFi hub for dApps, smart contracts, NFT marketplaces, and even decentralized exchanges. And $HYPER will be used as the main token in this ecosystem. Moreover, $HYPER’s economics are designed to encourage early participation and long-term sustainability. With a capped supply, transparent vesting schedule, and presale nearing completion, market watchers see potential for a strong post-listing debut once trading begins in early 2026. According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could trade at $0.08625 in 2026, potentially reaching $0.253 by 2030. That could be anywhere from a 552% to a 1,814% increase in 1–5 years. The current presale price stands at $0.013215 per token, with a few hours left before the next price increase. The project also offers 46% staking rewards, offering good passive income for long-term holders. For investors capitalizing on Bitcoin’s future price, $HYPER represents an asymmetrical opportunity. It gives you exposure to Bitcoin’s growth story with the upside potential of an early-stage infrastructure token. ➡️ Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper right now. With Bitcoin dominance surpassing 53% and DeFi liquidity migrating back to $BTC-linked projects, $HYPER could become one of the more compelling blockchain narratives in 2025’s infrastructure cycle. Investors looking to diversify within the Bitcoin ecosystem can join the presale before the price rise — currently at $0.013215. 👉 Buy $HYPER on the official site.

Business Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., November 29, 2023. Noah Berger/AWS/Handout via REUTERS Amazon's $38 billion cloud deal with OpenAI marks a major endorsement for the e-commerce giant's cloud business after recent setbacks, including ceding market share to rivals and an outage that disrupted large parts of the internet. After years of leading the cloud computing industry with its highly profitable Amazon Web Services business, Amazon has watched Microsoft and Alphabet's Google snatch big-ticket contracts with their AI-steeped clouds. Its lead in the cloud market slipped to 29 per cent as of September, from 34 per cent a few months before ChatGPT was launched in 2022, according to data from Synergy Research Group. Amazon was considered a laggard in the AI race by many investors because it was late to launch a flagship large language model and for failing to offer a consumer-facing chatbot like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Title: BofA boss Brian Moynihan forced by board, restless shareholders to hold first investor day in 14 years: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/04/business/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-to-hold-his-first-investor-day-since-2011/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
It took him long enough. This week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan will hold his first “investor day” since 2011 – breaking 14 years of silence that nicely highlights the positively awful job he has done communicating with investors. Insiders say that 66-year-old Moynihan, who only recently laid out a succession plan, was likely prodded to call the Wednesday powwow by his board, which is fielding shareholder demands for a clear plan to boost the bank’s stock price – and a strategy to compete against its archrival, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase. BofA is the US’s second-largest bank by assets, right behind JPM. But by many other metrics, it’s an also-ran. Its stock perennially lags JPM’s – and all the other big banks, for that matter. It fails to win big banking assignments that go to JPM and Goldman Sachs. Nor does it capitalize on trading volatility because it’s been so risk averse. Insiders blame Moynihan, a lawyer by training who cut his managerial teeth as general counsel of Fleet Boston, which was among the multitude of acquisitions that led to the creation of the modern BofA. He took over as CEO in 2010, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that nearly caused BofA to collapse. Moynihan won praise for his early caution, but according to critics inside and out of the bank, he’s been running the place the same way ever since by scaling back on risk and merely managing the bank’s balance sheet. It’s the reason why the stock has lagged JPMorgan and all of the Big 6 banks. Critics say part of Moynihan’s problem is that he never left Boston. He still manages BofA’s sprawling operations there with a few confidantes, even though its main headquarters is in New York (with a huge hub in Charlotte where it was once domiciled before its massive expansion). The investor day is being held not in NYC but in Boston. Another problem is BofA’s board. It’s considered among the most CEO-friendly in finance, which is why Moynihan didn’t set a succession timetable until recently (he wants to stay in job for the next five years). “The board and those that he surrounds himself with have allowed him to operate this way for some time,” said one BofA insider. “At some point, it becomes overly obvious how much of an outlier you are to your peers.” A BofA spokesman said it’s “completely untrue” that the board prodded him to hold the annual meeting or announce his succession plans. “The day gives us a chance to tell the comprehensive story of our franchise, how we are growing each of our businesses, and the opportunities for growth in the future,” the spokesman said, adding that analysts are starting to buy into Moynihan’s future growth plans. As many as 25 analysts now have buy recommendations on BofA stock. Whether it’s because of pressure from the board, his employees, investors or all three, Moynihan has been more visible lately. In addition to creating a succession plan and elevating a trio of executives to pole positions to succeed him, Moynihan has been doing media as he attempts to explain BofA’s new strategy. His new soundbite is “responsible growth”. Company insiders say Moynihan is still a firm believer in avoiding balance sheet risk, so don’t expect big trading profits when the markets get crazy like you see from Goldman Sachs. BofA also doesn’t post surprise trading losses. One metric Moynihan’s flacks keep touting: The bank recorded more than a dozen years of consistent growth in its sales and trading division. Which means when you cut through the spin, his strategy is more of the same. It’s important to note Moynihan’s caution has cost his shareholders money. In 2021, his team misread interest rates and dived headfirst into super safe treasuries that got crushed when inflation spiked and the Fed raised interest rates. A key reason that BofA — despite its massive balance sheet — remains an also-ran is that he hasn’t allowed traders to use that balance sheet even to support client deals, thus it doesn’t get the best client assignments, insiders say.

Never miss a story. On Wednesday, Moynihan won’t be the only one doing the talking; more than a dozen BofA executives are expected to speak including the three men poised to take his job: Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking, chief financial officer Alastair Borthwick and Jim DeMare, head of global markets. DeMare is seen to have the inside track on the inside track because of the bank’s new found love of taking capital markets risk, albeit in a responsible manner – whatever that means. Advertisement

Title: The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has rejected Elon Musk's $1 trillion Tesla pay package

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The bank behind the world's largest sovereign wealth fund has just dealt a blow to Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, said on Tuesday it had voted against the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. The bank said that while it appreciated the "significant value" created under the billionaire's leadership, it had concerns about the size of the package, dilution, and the lack of mitigation of Musk's "key person risk" for Tesla. The fund, which is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional investor, also voted against Musk's previous pay package in 2024. In January, leaked messages revealed an icy text exchange between the Tesla boss and Norges' CEO Nicolai Tangen, with the billionaire telling Tangen that "friends are as friends do." Norway's sovereign wealth fund is the largest institutional investor to publicly say how it has voted on the $1 trillion pay package. The fund has a 1.2% share in the EV giant. Tesla's CEO compensation plan has come under fire from some investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Retirement Fund. Proxy firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also urged shareholders to vote against it, prompting Musk to label them "corporate terrorists" in a recent earnings call. Several other big investors, including Florida's State Board of Administration and ARK Invest's Cathy Wood, have expressed support. Vanguard and BlackRock, Tesla's two largest institutional shareholders, have not yet said how they are voting. The 2025 CEO compensation plan would award Musk around $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares, assuming he hits a series of ambitious goals over the next decade. These include raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion, selling 1 million Optimus robots, boosting annual earnings way above those reported by tech giants Meta and Google, and planning his own succession. Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment. Jump to

Title: Is AI coming for your job? Maybe, but permanent displacement would be a historical first
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/04/is-ai-coming-for-your-job-maybe/87065768007/

As the job market cools and companies announce layoffs or drops in hiring tied to artificial intelligence, Americans are asking a familiar but urgent question: Is automation coming for their jobs? Once confined to routine and administrative tasks, AI can read medical scans, develop software, and take on projects that used to require a human touch. Amazon confirmed Oct. 28 that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs, citing an announcement from earlier this year that said the company expected to reduce its workforce as it implements generative AI and agents that “should change the way our work is done.” Leaders at companies like Salesforce have made similar announcements this year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the trend is something policymakers are watching closely. “You see a significant number of companies either announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring, or actually doing layoffs, and much of the time, they’re talking about AI,” Powell said Oct. 29. “We don’t really see it in the initial claims data yet. Now, it’s not a surprise that we don’t. It takes some time for it to get in there.” It wouldn’t be the first time innovation reshaped the workforce. More than 100 years ago, the United States shifted from an agrarian to an industrial economy. A similarly large transformation, from an industrial to a digital economy, is taking place now, according to Darrell West, a Brookings Institution senior fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation. While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much AI is driving layoffs or drops in hiring, signs of its growing impact are hard to miss. From Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski in May telling CNBC the Swedish fintech company reduced its workforce by 40% to Ford CEO Jim Farley in June saying AI will “replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S,” AI is making its mark on the U.S. workforce. Max Leaming, ManpowerGroup’s head of data science and AI solutions, pointed out one of the first areas affected by AI is software development. It’s not a surprise, he said. It could make sense that AI is learning to do some of the work done by the people it interacts with most. Leaming is keeping an eye on Project Mercury, an internal initiative at OpenAI Bloomberg uncovered and found had hired investment bankers to train AI for financial modeling and analysis — things typically done by early-career workers. Leaming said there may be broader implications if this plan works, and the pattern spreads. “Who replaces these managers? If you’re not hiring entry-level people into these technical roles, who is learning those roles to fill the management position somewhere down the road? I don’t know the answer to that," he said. An October Yale Budget Lab study found the broader labor market has not experienced “a discernible disruption” since ChatGPT’s release, noting that widespread technological impacts are typically felt over decades, not months or years. A recent survey highlighted by The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found only 1% of service firms reported they have let workers go due to AI in the last six months, down from 10% in last year's survey. However, 13% said they anticipate layoffs in the next half-year. If AI is widely adopted, an August Goldman Sachs report estimated 6% to 7% of U.S. workers could lose their jobs. Earlier this year, a World Economic Forum report estimated that new technology, alongside other economic and demographic trends, will create 170 million jobs and displace 92 million others by 2030. “Any efficiency that displaces workers was temporary,” Leaming said of past technological revolutions. “If we wind up with a permanent state of displaced, disenfranchised workers with AI, it’ll be the first time in human history that has happened.” Some experts believe AI will create enough new roles to offset job losses, but that could depend on how policymakers and employers react now. Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, speaking at a Harvard Business Review event, said AI will create as many jobs as it replaces if workers are effectively trained, according to Axios. “This is a system-wide transformation that’s going to affect large numbers of people,” West said. “In the past, when we’ve had big economic changes, there have been programs to help people make the transition and to get them the skills that they’re going to need in order to qualify for new jobs.” Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 2024 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, said society generally has two paths forward regarding AI. If companies largely use the technology to automate work, he expects there will be fewer jobs. “I’m not predicting a job apocalypse in the next year or five years,” Acemoglu said. “But if AI pervasively goes into an automation direction, there will be fewer jobs. There'll be some job creation, but not enough.” But if companies embrace pro-worker AI, designed to complement humans and empower employees, he said the technology, alongside retraining, could provide a boost to real wages, and “even limit the extent of inequality.” A report from the National Science Association and the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity found AI is expected to disrupt about 25% of all jobs in the next three years. “However, this figure is somewhat misleading, as certain industries and jobs within them are likely to face more substantial job loss due to automation and AI implementation than others,” the report says. It identified five industries most likely to experience a displacement of workers, as they rely heavily on technological skills. Those sectors were: wholesale trade; retail trade; finance and insurance; educational services; and real estate, rental and leasing. It also identified five industries least likely to be impacted by AI, as they require more human judgment or manual dexterity. They are: management of companies and enterprises; mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; government; agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; and administrative and support services. While AI can already fill in spreadsheets, it can’t grab coffee with a friend of a friend and strike up a business partnership. Leaming said workers should lean into their humanity and personal relationships if they want to bring their companies value. “People who tend to grow their careers like that are of a certain personality type. They tend to be more social,” Leaming said. “But I think that’s the real protection against AI taking your job.” Reach Rachel Barber atrbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_

Title: LIZ PEEK: AI layoffs could spark a socialist surge if America ignores the warning signs

Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.' What if Sen. Bernie Sanders is right and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is wrong? What if the AI revolution causes mass layoffs of American workers, as the Vermont senator warned in a recent Fox News op-ed? And what if Powell is wrong that the softening labor market is due primarily to supply issues — lower immigration and a lower labor participation rate — rather than AI-produced "efficiencies"? What will be the response of policymakers? What should it be? SEN SANDERS: AI MUST BENEFIT EVERYONE, NOT JUST A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES AI will soon become a political battleground. Democratic socialist Sanders, ever the class warrior, has already questioned whether AI will help all Americans or only "a handful of billionaires." Like the trade deals that sent millions of jobs overseas, Sanders worries that the massive investment flowing into AI could result in up to 100 million Americans losing their jobs over the next decade. He could be right; imagine the repercussions. Young people are already losing faith in capitalism and cozying up to socialism. Two-thirds of Democrats now view socialism more positively than capitalism. Nothing could undermine our capitalist system faster than widespread job losses stemming from a tech breakthrough cheered by the investor class. This is the critical issue of our day — one getting scant attention, even from self-described "data-driven" Powell, who is perennially looking backward rather than forward. In his latest press conference, Powell answered one question about employment by saying, "The supply of workers has dropped very, very sharply due to mainly immigration, but also lower labor force participation. So, and that means there’s less need for new jobs, because there’s -- there isn’t this flow into the pool of labor where people need jobs." Excuse me, what? The economy is growing, yet hiring is declining. Though the government shutdown has blocked the usual monthly labor reports, plenty of data suggests the job market is weakening. Companies are increasingly citing AI investment as a factor in lower headcounts. TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA Corporate America is spending tens of billions of dollars on AI, promising shareholders great gains in productivity. But where will that productivity come from, other than reducing headcounts? Certainly, people armed with artificial intelligence can deliver information and analyses more rapidly, making themselves and their organizations more productive. But ultimately, it will also make some people redundant and slow new hiring. The impact on America’s labor market will be profound — and is largely being ignored. Amazon recently announced it was laying off 14,000 employees. A top human resources official at the firm sent a note titled "Staying nimble and continuing to strengthen our organizations." She wrote that "the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." What kinds of workers are at risk? Factory workers and truck drivers, for sure, who are already being replaced by robots and AI — but also white-collar employees. Fortune notes that the Amazon layoffs "show it’s coming for middle management first." The world’s largest retailer employs about 1.5 million people; 14,000 is a drop in the bucket. But the trend is worrisome — and for those 14,000 people, devastating. Amazon is not alone. UPS recently announced it has cut 48,000 jobs this year — 14,000 management positions and 34,000 in operations. UPS started the year with about 500,000 employees. Target also made headlines recently, saying it will cut 8% of its corporate workforce — its first significant layoffs in a decade. JOBS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FROM AI, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas cites market and economic conditions as the main reason for most corporate layoffs to date but also points to AI. That makes sense. After all, the economy is growing briskly — second-quarter real GDP growth was 3.8%, and it looks like we’ll see robust expansion for the third quarter as well. There has never been a faster adoption of new technology. Already, an estimated one-third of Americans use AI; ChatGPT receives 5.4 billion visits per month. Global AI revenues are expected to total $391 billion this year and could reach $3.5 trillion by 2033. These estimates may be optimistic, but top tech firms are investing about $400 billion this year alone to expand capacity, according to The Wall Street Journal. They clearly believe the projections. Bernie Sanders aside, no one should want to halt the AI revolution. Artificial intelligence promises extraordinary advances in medicine and other sciences — and could radically improve education for America’s children. It’s also largely American companies that will benefit from the explosion in AI spending, reaping the profits and influence that come with global dominance of a new technology. Rising productivity will spur hiring in certain industries and boost real wages. It will also allow for the retirement of the 20-plus million baby boomers still working. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But there may well be a period of adjustment when layoffs exceed job creation. Unemployment may rise, fueling anger at the innovations producing more out-of-work Americans and resentment toward the companies behind the disruptions. Sen. Bernie Sanders joined the co-hosts of "The View" to discuss his new book on Monday, October 20, 2025. (ABC/TheView) Lawmakers and financial leaders need to be prepared for this possibility — one that could deepen voters’ growing affection for socialism and rejection of capitalism. That would be a disaster for a country that has outperformed every other nation on Earth, producing unprecedented opportunity and wealth. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Otherwise, it will be Bernie Sanders and his left-wing colleagues dictating the response. Sanders advocates a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay, giving workers significantly more power and imposing a "robot tax" on big tech companies. Such measures would slow American competitiveness and growth, as they have in Europe. We cannot allow that to happen.

Title: Trump Just Issued A ‘Very Big’ China Warning As Bitcoin Teeters On The Verge Of A Major $100,000 Price Crash

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has suddenly plummeted, diving toward the closely-watched $100,000 per bitcoin level (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issues a stark, $38 trillion U.S. bankruptcy warning). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has soared since the reelection of U.S. president Donald Trump last year, rising on a wave of enthusiasm for bitcoin and crypto, but its rally has stalled in recent months despite U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent quietly sending the market a “signal” last week. Ahead of the bitcoin price crashing toward $100,000, U.S. president Donald Trump warned China is trying to take on the U.S. as the world’s “capital of crypto.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Trump warned that if the U.S. doesn’t dominate the crypto field, then China will, comparing the battle to lead in development of the technology to the artificial intelligence race. "I don’t want to have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto," Trump told CBS’s 60 Minutes. “Because in crypto it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two. And right now we’re number one by a long shot. I want to keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto." Trump added that, "China is getting into it very big, right now," perhaps referring to Hong Kong’s plans to ease rules to encourage crypto trading activity in the city. However, crypto trading and mining remains illegal in mainland China following a 2021 ban. Despite Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world,” the bitcoin price has this year failed to make gains much above the levels it reached at the end of 2024. “Bitcoin’s price has been moving sideways since July this year,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments, pointing to the possibility the bitcoin price could recover to beyond its all-time high of $126,000 per bitcoin if macro factors align. “If, however, bitcoin drops below $100,000 and consolidates under that level, it could decline further into the $96,000-$93,000 range. Still, I see the $100,000 level as a psychologically significant threshold, so much will depend on how the market behaves there. Most likely, the price will once again rebound from this level, just as it did in June 2025. In simple terms, this area represents a strong support zone.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Alongside the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto, Wall Street has been piling into bitcoin via crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since they were given the green light by regulators in early 2024. Led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, bitcoin ETFs have bought up 1.5 million bitcoin worth $160 billion—just over 7% of bitcoin’s 21 million bitcoins—though Wall Street’s demand for bitcoin ETFs has failed to prevent the bitcoin price collapse from its all-time highs. “Unless ETF inflows or other marginal buyers step in with sufficient spot demand to absorb this distribution, there remains a tangible risk of bitcoin retesting the $106,000 - $107,000 support zone and, if lost, potentially extending toward the $100,000 region or lower over the coming weeks," analysts with the Bitfinex crypto exchange said in emailed comments.

Title: Norway wealth fund to vote against Musk's Tesla pay deal
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1104/1542051-norway-wealth-fund-to-vote-against-musks-tesla-pay-deal/

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said today it would vote against ratifying Tesla CEO Elon Musk's proposed compensation package, containing shares worth up to $1 trillion, at an annual general meeting this week. Investors in the electric-vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever CEO compensation agreement, which critics have called excessive. So far, the Norwegian wealth fund is the largest outside Tesla investor to say how it plans to vote. The next-largest to do so, Baron Capital, said yesterday it would back Musk's pay package. The company's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning last week that Musk could leave the company if the deal is rejected. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk - consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12% stake worth $17 billion, also voted "no" to Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. Various groups have tried and failed to block record payouts to Musk, including a $56 billion compensation plan for 2018 that investors reapproved last year, though legal challenges remain. NBIM also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for reelection, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Musk. Tesla says its CEO will earn "nothing" unless the company's market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is only paid if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase. Yet Musk could still reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting many of those targets, according to experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends. Top US investment firms are under pressure from Republican politicians to pay less attention to environmental, social and governance concerns at companies in which they invest and Musk has been an ally of President Donald Trump. The political pressure makes it harder for large investors to vote independently, said Matt Moscardi, CEO of director analytics firm Free Float Analytics. Top investors, Moscardi said, "at this point, almost can't vote against management." Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Bitcoin’s Last Support Before $100K Breaks as 'Mag 7' Skew Flips, Oracle CDS Surges

Bitcoin BTC$104,084.39 has fallen below a key support level that had been holding back a slide toward $100,000, amid weakening momentum in tech stocks. The leading cryptocurrency fell below $106,000 during Asian trading hours, penetrating the level that had offered support multiple times in recent weeks, according to CoinDesk data. Major altcoins such as ether ETH$3,454.90, XRP$2.3695 and solana SOL$162.28, with SOL sliding to $157, the lowest since Aug. 3. Ether also fell to its lowest since August, with a bear cross of key moving averages pointing to strengthening of downside momentum and XRP hit a three-week low. BTC's breakdown shifts focus to the $100,000-$101,000 area, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. A violation there could open the door to a deeper test near $94,000, or even a full retracement toward $85,000, the maximum pain zone that also aligns with strong on-chain support, Thielen said in a note to clients. "While such a move would be extreme, downside risk remains contained as long as bitcoin holds above its prevailing downtrend line," he added. BTC's dour price action follows dwindling odds of rapid Fed rate cuts and signs of bullish turnaround in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies. Furthermore, there are signs of overexuberance in the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla — which is typically seen at major market tops. "The put-call skew in the Mag7 complex inverted for the first time since December of last year (i.e. implied volatility of calls traded over puts). This phenomenon has only happened a handful of times. The move implies investors are overwhelmingly positioned for continued upside," analyst Neil Sethi said on X, quoting Goldman Sachs. "Historically, such low skew readings have tended to coincide with short-term consolidation or reversals as optimism peaks," Sethi added. At the same time, the credit default swap (CDS) tied to Oracle, which measures the cost of insuring against a potential default, has surged following the company’s massive third-quarter AI investment disclosures – reaching levels not seen outside periods of significant macro stress. This, according to some analysts, represents investor anxiety regarding the booming AI spending. AI optimism has been one of the major drivers of the bull market in both stocks and wider risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, since 2023. All things considered, bulls might be better off being cautious rather than overly exuberant.

Title: The great AI displacement begins: White-collar jobs targeted in corporate America’s efficiency push

Major companies like Amazon and NestlÃ© are cutting thousands of jobs due to AI. This wave of automation uniquely targets white-collar and cognitive roles. Corporate leaders state this strategic shift is happening during robust profitability. Every job level is expected to be transformed by this AI-driven restructuring. This wave of automation uniquely targets white-collar and cognitive roles. Corporate leaders state this strategic shift is happening during robust profitability. Every job level is expected to be transformed by this AI-driven restructuring. Corporate leaders state this strategic shift is happening during robust profitability. Every job level is expected to be transformed by this AI-driven restructuring. Every job level is expected to be transformed by this AI-driven restructuring. The CEOs of the world's largest corporations are now openly declaring that artificial intelligence will systematically reduce their human payroll. WhenÂ Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged this summer that the company's adoption of AI would shift its workforce needs, telling employees Amazon would "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," it was just the tip of the iceberg. We're seeing numerous examples of corporate confirmation of what many workers have long feared: The AI revolution is coming for knowledge workers, and the job landscape will never be the same. This corporate vision is already materializing into pink slips across corporate America. UPS revealed it had cut 34,000 operational jobs. NestlÃ© plans to reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years to achieve âoperational efficiencyâ by âleveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.â In a telling move, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents. AndÂ Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate positions, although CEO Andy Jassy later stated these cuts were not "really AI-driven, not right now, at least," suggesting cuts that are more explicitly connected to AI could be coming. What makes this trend particularly alarming is its timing. Unlike traditional layoffs that occur during economic downturns, these staff reductions are happening during a period of robust profitability. This signals a fundamental transformation in the organization of work itself, driven not by financial necessity but by a strategic pivot to automated systems. The very nature of value and labor is being redefined by corporate executives. A new target for automation This new wave of automation differs fundamentally from its predecessors. Past technologies mimicked the human body, replacing manual or routine physical tasks. Artificial intelligence, in contrast, targets the human brainâs cognitive abilities. It doesnât just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions. This shift places white-collar analytical roles, traditionally among the most secure employment categories, directly in the crosshairs. The data confirms the widespread vulnerability. A Society for Human Resource Management study found that 12.6 percent of U.S. jobs, approximately 19.2 million positions, face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI, with middle- and high-income professions especially exposed. Shifting skills and corporate motives Some observers urge caution, suggesting the fear of mass job losses is overstated. They argue that jobs are not disappearing but transforming, requiring new hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with uniquely human capabilities. One digital agency CEO estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that âtrue end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.â Other experts express skepticism about corporate motives. One finance professor suggested that some layoffs, framed as part of an AI transformation, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than reflecting genuine technological necessity. In an uncertain economy, announcing an "AI transformation" reassures investors that management has a forward-thinking plan, regardless of the immediate human cost. The scope of this change is vast, impacting every level of an organization. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that every one of the retail giant's 1.6 million U.S. jobs will be changed by AI, "whether it's getting the shopping carts off the parking lot, or the way our technologists work, or certainly the way leadership roles change." This sentiment echoes across corporate America, revealing a top-down re-engineering of the workplace where no position is considered sacred. As corporations rush to replace human decision-making with algorithmic efficiency, the American worker is left navigating an uncertain future. The promises of new types of jobs and increased productivity are cold comfort for those whose livelihoods are deemed redundant. This corporate-led revolution, justified by the relentless pursuit of efficiency, is reshaping the economic order with profound consequences for liberty, livelihood, and the very definition of work in a free society.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned that every one of the retail giant's 1.6 million U.S. jobs will be changed by AI, "whether it's getting the shopping carts off the parking lot, or the way our technologists work, or certainly the way leadership roles change." This sentiment echoes across corporate America, revealing a top-down re-engineering of the workplace where no position is considered sacred. As corporations rush to replace human decision-making with algorithmic efficiency, the American worker is left navigating an uncertain future. The promises of new types of jobs and increased productivity are cold comfort for those whose livelihoods are deemed redundant. This corporate-led revolution, justified by the relentless pursuit of efficiency, is reshaping the economic order with profound consequences for liberty, livelihood, and the very definition of work in a free society.

A Society for Human Resource Management study found that 12.6 percent of U.S. jobs, approximately 19.2 million positions, face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI, with middle- and high-income professions especially exposed. Shifting skills and corporate motives Some observers urge caution, suggesting the fear of mass job losses is overstated. They argue that jobs are not disappearing but transforming, requiring new hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with uniquely human capabilities. One digital agency CEO estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that âtrue end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.â Other experts express skepticism about corporate motives. One finance professor suggested that some layoffs, framed as part of an AI transformation, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than reflecting genuine technological necessity.

Meta borrowed $30 billion in debt, signaling that even cash-rich tech giants can no longer fund the astronomical costs of the AI race from revenue alone, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. While Meta's stock price fell due to shareholder anxiety over spending, the bond offering was met with overwhelming demand, indicating debt investors' strong confidence in the company's robust financial health and ability to repay. The primary driver for this debt is the need to fund expensive AI infrastructure, specifically data centers filled with advanced and costly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) required to train sophisticated AI models. The move highlights a stark divide where established giants like Meta and Oracle can access low-interest debt, while unprofitable AI startups are forced to cede ownership through equity fundraising, giving the titans a major advantage. This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation.

This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation. In a stunning financial maneuver that signals a new phase in the artificial intelligence arms race, Facebook's parent company Meta turned to the debt markets this week, borrowing a staggering $30 billion. The move reveals a fundamental shift for cash-rich tech behemoths, as even the most profitable companies are finding their war chests insufficient to bankroll the astronomical costs of the race for superintelligence. This pivot to massive debt accumulation marks a pivotal moment, raising profound questions about the sustainability of the AI boom. For decades, internet titans have been defined by immense cash flows, able to fund ambitious projects from profits alone. That era may be closing. Meta's decision to issue bonds comes despite the company taking in over $100 billion in annual revenue. The sheer scale of this borrowing indicates that the financial requirements for leading the AI revolution are unprecedented, dwarfing even the most ambitious tech projects of the past. A market of contradictions The debt offering occurred on the same day that Meta's stock price plunged more than 11 percent, a reaction from shareholders spooked by aggressive spending and disappointing earnings. This divergence paints a complex picture: equity investors are growing anxious, while debt investors displayed overwhelming confidence. Demand for Meta's bonds was reportedly four times greater than the supply, a clear signal that the credit market views the social media titan as a safe bet. This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI. The core of this is the data center, massive facilities packed with advanced computer chips called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These incredibly powerful and expensive processors are uniquely capable of handling the immense calculations needed to train sophisticated AI models. Acquiring these chips and building the facilities to house them requires capital on a scale rarely seen outside of national defense budgets. Meta is not alone in this debt-fueled pursuit. Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage. For pioneering AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, the situation is entirely different. These companies, despite their groundbreaking technology, are not yet profitable. The debt market is a hostile territory for them, as lenders would charge exorbitant interest rates to compensate for the risk of failure. Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble? The markets, for now, are shrugging off the possibility of a burst. The confidence in Meta's bond offering suggests that institutional investors believe the AI revolution is real and that its leaders will be rewarded. However, the parallel decline in Meta's stock price serves as a cautionary tale. It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency." The ultimate gamble The ultimate conclusion of this high-stakes financial drama remains unwritten. The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector. It demonstrates that the pursuit of artificial superintelligence is now the primary strategic objective for the worldâs most powerful companies, an objective so costly that it requires mortgaging future profits for decades to come. The success or failure of this gamble will not only determine the winners and losers in the AI race but will also reshape the global economic landscape for a generation.

The success or failure of this gamble will not only determine the winners and losers in the AI race but will also reshape the global economic landscape for a generation. Watch this Fox Business report onÂ Trump's AI and tech investments being lauded. This video is from theÂ Newsclips channel on Brighteon.com. Sources include:Â Techexplore.com msn.com barrons.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com The debt offering occurred on the same day that Meta's stock price plunged more than 11 percent, a reaction from shareholders spooked by aggressive spending and disappointing earnings. This divergence paints a complex picture: equity investors are growing anxious, while debt investors displayed overwhelming confidence. Demand for Meta's bonds was reportedly four times greater than the supply, a clear signal that the credit market views the social media titan as a safe bet. This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI. The core of this is the data center, massive facilities packed with advanced computer chips called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These incredibly powerful and expensive processors are uniquely capable of handling the immense calculations needed to train sophisticated AI models. Acquiring these chips and building the facilities to house them requires capital on a scale rarely seen outside of national defense budgets. Meta is not alone in this debt-fueled pursuit. Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage. For pioneering AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, the situation is entirely different. These companies, despite their groundbreaking technology, are not yet profitable. The debt market is a hostile territory for them, as lenders would charge exorbitant interest rates to compensate for the risk of failure. Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble? The markets, for now, are shrugging off the possibility of a burst. The confidence in Meta's bond offering suggests that institutional investors believe the AI revolution is real and that its leaders will be rewarded. However, the parallel decline in Meta's stock price serves as a cautionary tale. It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency."

Title: AI Is Taking Its Toll On Jobs - What To Know

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind Some major companies have recently triggered a wave of layoffs, eliminating tens of thousands of jobs. Most cited artificial intelligence (AI) integration and automation as factors behind these moves.In this photo illustration, a phone screen displays an AI logo on May 16, 2025. AI use in customer service is rising, with 70 percent of interactions expected to involve AI in 2025, according to Wifi Talents. Oleksii Pydsosonnii/The Epoch TimesExperts say that while a significant portion of jobs cannot be replicated by machines, AI will likely usurp white-collar analytical roles and robotics will replace manual labor jobs.Amazon announced on Oct. 28 that it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate positions to stay “nimble.”UPS, meanwhile, revealed that it had cut 34,000 operational jobs during the first nine months of this year—a significantly larger reduction than the 20,000 layoffs announced in April—as part of its “efficiency reimagined” initiative.Nestlé said on Oct. 16 that it will reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years in an effort to achieve “operational efficiency” by “leveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.”In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

An online AI chat is very common these days. Instead of 0, I type in HUMAN. Sometimes it takes typing human 2 or 3 times. I have also run into AI while using the telephone customer service. No matter what the "choices" from the AI are, I just repeat HUMAN until they transfer to a living, breathing person. PS - I wonder if some young entrepreneur will develop an AI customer service with a thick East Indian accent. 8 posted on 11/03/2025 10:40:21 PM PST by Ronaldus Magnus III (Do, or do not, there is no try ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind I recently read that 1/3rd of hollywood jobs have disappeared. 48,000 gone.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Experts say that while a significant portion of jobs cannot be replicated by machines, AI will likely usurp white-collar analytical roles and robotics will replace manual labor jobs.Amazon announced on Oct. 28 that it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate positions to stay “nimble.”UPS, meanwhile, revealed that it had cut 34,000 operational jobs during the first nine months of this year—a significantly larger reduction than the 20,000 layoffs announced in April—as part of its “efficiency reimagined” initiative.Nestlé said on Oct. 16 that it will reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years in an effort to achieve “operational efficiency” by “leveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.”In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

The Arri Alexa digital movie camera was released in 2010. Since then, movie producers had a more plentiful, less expensive, and better filming options than Hollywood could offer. The James Bond movie "Skyfall" (2012) was filmed using Alexa digital cameras and won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.

It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Economists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts.

Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited). Airbus: Used Palantir to improve assembly of the A350 by about 30%—fewer delays, fewer mistakes, and more planes finished each month using the same factories and workers. BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail.

Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited).

BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last 1 posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. 2 posted on 11/03/2025 8:53:54 PM PST by dpetty121263 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited).

BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail.

Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” Guess there is always starvation...can’t work so no eats. “Salesforce...replaced 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.” I HATE any sort of automated phone “agent.” It usually takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get past the thoroughly useless bot to a (sometimes) helpful human. What a ridiculous time suck. I have NEVER gotten anything remotely useful from a phone AI agent / bot. AI is taking a toll on jobs not by replacing workers with itself, but by diverting resources to a company named nVidia. Not sure if AI has anything to do with it but... Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” wanna keep your business going? Have a human answering the phone instead of a computer. I threw contracts to providers simply because a human answered the phone. All it takes is one trip through “automated phone hell” to make up the price difference for parts. In the old days of touchtone phones, I would just press 0 to find a human. An online AI chat is very common these days. Instead of 0, I type in HUMAN. Sometimes it takes typing human 2 or 3 times. I have also run into AI while using the telephone customer service. No matter what the "choices" from the AI are, I just repeat HUMAN until they transfer to a living, breathing person. PS - I wonder if some young entrepreneur will develop an AI customer service with a thick East Indian accent. An online AI chat is very common these days. Instead of 0, I type in HUMAN.

Most I suspect due to the terrible scold movies and tv shows they make but AI is replacing background players and set design builders etc. The writing from AI is a rehash of the bad storylines already made. We are so screwed. AI = affordable Indians & outsourcing The MAJORITY of layoffs are still due to the same issue: BAD MANAGEMENT. Amazon, FEDEX and UPS all overstaffed during the lockdowns. The Auto companies and Power Companies made terrible Billion-dollar bets on Green Technology that is worthless. Fear is effortless. You just surrender to it. Courage takes faith—faith in God, faith in reason, faith in the idea that progress and truth exist beyond our own anxieties. Fear shrinks the world. Faith and critical thought expand it. “What To Know”. Et tu, Epoch Times? Et tu? Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited). Airbus: Used Palantir to improve assembly of the A350 by about 30%—fewer delays, fewer mistakes, and more planes finished each month using the same factories and workers. BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail. These aren’t future promises—they’re real improvements in speed, cost, reliability, and output. This is what applied AI actually looks like in the real world.Stronger companies create real jobs.

Several major US corporations in the last month have announced plans to cut thousands of workers as layoffs in the American economy have reached their highest level since 2020, when much of the global economy was shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As reported by Bloomberg on Monday, major firms including Target, Amazon, Paramount, and Molson Coors in October announced plans to lay off a combined total of more than 17,000 workers for a wide variety of reasons ranging from the impact of artificial intelligence to declining sales. Taken together, these layoffs point to a significantly weakened labor market, which had already ground to a halt over the summer when the last jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed the economy created just 22,000 jobs in the month of August. And while the BLS has stopped releasing monthly employment reports during the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, Bloomberg pointed to data collected by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing that there have been “almost 950,000 US job cuts this year through September, the highest year-to-date total since 2020—and that was before the heavy October run of announcements.” Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, told Bloomberg that he has detected a definite shift in the jobs market in recent weeks. “We’re not just in a low hire, low fire environment anymore,” he explained. “We’re firing.” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, said in an interview with Reuters that he also expected the labor market to get worse in the coming months due to “adverse policy shocks emanating from Washington,” as well as “the change in behavior among corporates who hoarded labor for the past four to five years,” and were thus reluctant to carry out layoffs. “That was never an indefinite behavior,” he said. “We’re going to see migration up in the unemployment rate.” John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News last week that he didn’t think that the layoffs announced over the last month were just a blip. “These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,” he emphasized. One challenge for economists in assessing the current state of the economy is the vast gulf between the experiences of America’s highest-earning households and households at the bottom of the economic ladder. According to a Monday report from CNBC, recent corporate earnings reports have shown signs of a so-called “K-shaped” economy in which well-off consumers are maintaining or increasing their spending while low-income consumers are being forced to cut back. “Last week, Chipotle reported it’s seeing consumers who make less than $100,000 a year, which represents roughly 40% of the company’s customer base, spending less frequently due to concerns about the economy and inflation,” CNBC noted. “Coca-Cola said in its third-quarter earnings that pricier products like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes are driving its growth. Procter & Gamble reported similar results, saying wealthier customers are buying more from club retailers, which sell bigger pack sizes, while lower-income shoppers are significantly pulling back.” A Monday report from Fortune similarly picked up on evidence that the US is in the midst of a K-shaped economy, as it found that the percentage of Americans taking on subprime loans in the third quarter of 2025 reached its highest level since 2019. This is significant, Fortune noted, because an increased reliance on subprime loans “adds to signs that many are facing increased financial pressure” to make ends meet. What’s more, Fortune pointed to a recent analysis from Moody’s showing that the top 20% of households in the US are now responsible for economic growth, while the bottom 80% have essentially been stagnant. Lucia Dunn, an economist at Ohio State University, told Fortune that this economic disparity could increase instability if not addressed. “We are losing the middle class,” Dunn said. “And when you get to a society where there are a lot of people at the bottom and then a small group at the top, that’s a prescription for real trouble.” The reports of the layoffs in corporate American come as a new analysis released Monday by Oxfam offered the latest look at extreme wealth inequality in the US, with the the 10 wealthiest Americans gaining nearly $700 billion so far this year—and as millions of people have lost crucial federal food assistance due to the government shutdown and the Trump administration’s refusal to release full benefits.

Title: Palantir is proud of its 'disciplined' hiring practices

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Palantir is proud of its "disciplined" hiring practices. The defense tech company reported earnings that beat estimates on Monday, and CEO Alex Karp touted Palantir's approach to talent recruitment in his shareholder letter. Karp notes that while the company has "grown quite significantly," it has kept to its "constraints." "Our head count is one manifestation of this disciplined approach," Karp wrote in the letter to shareholders. "The casual expansion of our ranks would have diminished the need to lean even more heavily on the strength of our software and the Ontology and to ensure their continued maturation. "The alternative would have been to rely on an army of bright minds to do work that would have obscured the platform's weaknesses and ultimately hindered its development," Karp added. The message of maintaining a lean head count arrives at a moment when other companies are pivoting to leaner workforces. There have been significant layoffs at multiple large companies, particularly in middle-management roles. Throughout the year, Microsoft has laid off around 15,000 employees in total with multiple rounds of cuts. In October, Amazon announced it is cutting about 14,000 corporate jobs, or roughly 4% of its white-collar workforce, as part of an effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, the retail giant, also announced in the same month that it would lay off 1,000 corporate employees to eliminate what the company called "overlapping work." During Amazon's latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said that the company's rapid growth in recent years created "a lot more layers" that have slowed decision-making, and that the layoff is about "culture" instead of cost cutting or AI. To make the job market picture more unclear, the government shutdown is preventing the release of job data from September onwards. Based on the most recent available data from August, the labor market missed expectations by a wide margin. Jump to

by Michael Snyder | Nov 3, 2025 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. What is the Fed not telling us? The numbers clearly indicate that big trouble is brewing in the banking system. I wish that I could specifically tell you which banks are in the most trouble, but at this stage, we simply aren’t being told anything. They probably figure that the best approach is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible. But they won’t be able to keep a lid on what is going on indefinitely, and when word finally gets out, people could start to panic. In recent weeks, bank reserves have fallen to alarmingly low levels. In fact, last week they fell to the lowest level that we have seen in more than four years… US bank reserves have crashed to a four-year low, plunging to about $2.8 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve data, sending fresh warning signals across Wall Street and Washington. The steep decline marks the second straight week reserves have stayed below $3 trillion, a critical threshold analysts say could test the banking system’s liquidity strength. By itself, this doesn’t necessarily signal that we are facing a major crisis. But everyone agrees that what we are witnessing is certainly unusual. What is causing far more alarm is what occurred on Friday. All of a sudden, there was an insane amount of demand for overnight repo cash… Federal Reserve reportedly pumped about $29.4 billion into the markets via overnight repos. That’s a big number and it signals something I’m watching closely. According to the data for “Overnight Repurchase Agreements — Treasury Securities Purchased by the Fed” the figure for Oct 31, 2025 is $29.400 billion. In other words: The Fed is quietly stepping in and stepping up. To me, this is clear evidence that something just broke. Who suddenly needed that much cash? And why did they need it? The chart that I have posted below comes directly from the Federal Reserve, and it should chill you to the core… But that wasn’t the end of it. By the end of the day on Friday, it was quite obvious that something extremely strange had just happened… Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage. The Fed’s Standing Repo Facility lent a total of $50.35 billion on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of $51.8 billion. So what is the bottom line? The bottom line is that it very much smells like a major crisis is brewing. But let’s wait and see what happens on Monday. If we see figures on Monday that are fairly normal, perhaps we have more time before things start breaking loose in the markets. However, if we see even larger numbers on Monday, hold on tight. In either case, the financial markets will not be able to stay disconnected from the real economy forever. Just like in 2008 and 2009, large employers all over the United States have been conducting mass layoffs. Sadly, this time around that includes some of our largest and most prosperous employers… The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. We haven’t seen anything like this in many years. Bankruptcies are soaring, delinquency rates are spiking, thousands of stores and restaurants are permanently shutting their doors, and just about everything keeps getting more expensive. What we are now facing is being described as “Depression 2.0”. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning and most of the population understands this. In fact, one recent survey discovered that 57 percent of Americans expect economic conditions to get even worse over the next year. Many of you are going to be facing some very hard decisions in the coming months. If you currently have a job that you highly value, I would recommend holding on to it as tightly as you can. But if you feel that it is absolutely necessary to go somewhere else, you will just have to do what you have to do. Just understand that if you leave your current position it will not be easy to find a new one at all. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Many of them didn’t have anything to fall back on, and so large numbers of them also lost their homes. This is one of the reasons why it is so critical to have a sizable emergency fund. At this point, even the mainstream media is stressing the importance of this… Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the economy crashes, that leaves no room to breathe. Having three to six months of essential expenses tucked away can make all the difference when cash flow dries up or jobs disappear overnight. Keep your emergency savings in an easily accessible account, not tied up in volatile investments. It’s not about hoarding—it’s about buying time and peace of mind. When others panic, you’ll have the stability to make smart, calm decisions. I expect things to start moving very quickly now. If the problems in our banking system bubble to the surface and start becoming highly visible, it will create a lot of fear. And it is just a matter of time before our absurdly overvalued stock market takes a dramatic tumble. Of course, all of this is happening at a time when so many other elements of “the Perfect Storm” are coming together. We are right on the brink of multiple major wars, global food supplies are rapidly getting tighter, we are being told that the next worldwide pandemic could break out at any moment, and on average, the U.S. has been getting hit by a “billion-dollar disaster” about every two weeks. I expect so much chaos to be unleashed during the weeks ahead, and that means that we should expect the turmoil that we are currently witnessing on Wall Street to escalate quite a bit more.

Title: ZCON Is Where All the Executives Want to Be, but the Creators Are in Control

Last week saw the Sundance Institute form a union, thousands of layoffs at Paramount, and buyouts at YouTube. It also brought two events that point toward the future: ZCON and Square Peg Social. Now in its third year, ZCON is a two-day, invitation-only event in Los Angeles that centers on (yes) Gen Z and the people who love them. That assortment of attendees included creators (of course) as well as CEOs, CMOs, and studio executives. Sessions included “Rewriting the Rules of Branded Entertainment” and “The New Hollywood.” Auli’i Cravalho (“Moana”) highlighted her impatience with the old ways (“We are told that we’re too young, to wait our turn”); Owen Thiele (“Adults”) premiered “Girl Room,” a show co-created with Amazon Prime for TikTok and for Instagram; and Paralympian Ezra Frech declared, “Gen Z is the most inclusive generation of all time,” reframing disability as a great way for brands to resonate with consumers. Related Stories ‘Morte Cucina’ Review: Revenge Is a Dish Served with Style in Sumptuous Food Porn Thriller Lynne Ramsay Is Still Cutting ‘Die My Love’ — in Her Mind, at Least Held at the LA Preserve (a lush oasis off Hollywood’s scrabbly St. Andrews, the street made famous by Jane’s Addiction), the space flowed with bright and shiny 20-somethings with energy and agency. This generation isn’t intimidated by the attention of major brands, nor necessarily impressed by it. They expect it. For a long time, festivals were ground zero for young people who wanted to prove their value as hot commodities. Seeing so many young creators (and the creator adjacent) echoed similar groups at the Sundance Film Festival and SXSW. Of course, ZCON and Sundance are very different; brand partnerships are the lifeblood here, not distribution, and the event is owned by UTA. If Sundance is powered by pick-me energy and SXSW by VC hustle, the invite-only ZCON is doing something else altogether. It isn’t a tentpole so much as an extension of an ongoing conversation between founders and brands. A Gen Z nonprofit already knows that, say, Amazon’s global creative director is dying to know what they’ll do next, and development execs are on watch. Overseeing it all is Olivia Frary, a UTA Next Gen exec who came to the agency when it acquired Gen Z marketing company JUV Consulting in 2024. “For years, every single person on our team would end a call by just saying, “If there’s someone that you would want us to meet, let us know,” she said. “Even when we were super startup vibes, we would always kind of stress that was the best thing you could do for us, regardless of if you wanted to hire a Gen Z consultancy. A lot of [those connections] are showing up here that knew us when we were those crazy kids.” Now those same kids are shaping not only the culture, but also how it’s sold — at least until Gen A comes along. And if history is any guide, nothing will be more cringe to that generation than being called an influencer. For now, this cohort is enjoying the primacy so much that ZCON participants eagerly embraced an afternoon “recess” that featured a cavalcade of bubbles and dancing with a live DJ. Cringe to anyone else; here, it’s what happens before the final panel, “What Does a Happier Internet Look Like?” I’m going to wrap with a tease about digging into Square Peg Social, the inaugural, invite-only mentorship program created by Lars Knudsen and Ari Aster — a collaboration between established filmmakers and emerging voices. We previewed it this summer; nearly 1,800 applied. In the end, 37 writers, directors, and producers spent four days in direct mentorship with the creators behind not just Knudsen and Aster’s films (“Eddington,” “Midsommar,” “Beau Is Afraid”), but also “One Battle After Another,” “Iron Claw,” “Roofman,” “Rebel Ridge,” and more. Next week, I’ll share both the executive and filmmaker rosters (both are long and impressive; expect multiple stories). It would be the snarky/lazy thing to contrast the differences between Square Peg and ZCON (Art! Commerce!), but in truth they had more in common than not. Both are declarations of community, however self-selected. Because no matter where you land in this brave new world, one thing’s certain: No one will make it alone. (Bubbles remain optional.)

Title: Who’s Hit Hardest By Corporate America’s Mass Layoffs

ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. Amazon, Target, and UPS are some of the corporations that have recently announced job cuts. A slew of mass layoffs has hit corporate America, further exacerbating a stagnant job market. Other companies that announced mass layoffs include Intel, Nestle, Accenture, Ford, and Microsoft, among others. CBS also announced mass layoffs and has been mired in controversy; the company let go of veteran journalist Lisa Ling and a Variety report alleges that popular CBS anchor Gayle King will also be departing from the network. In addition, CBS dismantled their Race and Culture division and a former news producer named Trey Sherman accused the company of firing every person of color in his division. Some reports indicate that Amazon may have reduced staff because of the rise of AI but an Amazon spokesperson disputed this claim, according to CNN. Economic Times suggested that job cuts may be due to rising costs and slowing consumer spending. In addition, mass layoffs within the federal government have been ongoing since the start of 2025. The mass layoffs within several different industries coupled with the rising costs makes for a dangerous cocktail that threatens worker wellbeing. It's important to examine who is most impacted by these mass layoffs. Research reveals that women and non-white employees are more likely to be laid off than their counterparts. According to a 2016 Harvard Business Review report, when layoffs occur, women and racial minorities are more likely to be ousted. A 2021 study exploring the demographics of those laid off during the start of Covid-19 from January 2020 to August of 2020 mirror these findings; the research indicated that women and racial minorities were more likely to be laid off during this timeframe. The researchers theorized that this finding could be attributed to factors like direct discrimination against these groups and the fact that women and people from underrepresented racial groups are more likely to occupy lower status jobs than their counterparts. Mass layoffs can have deleterious and detrimental impacts on worker wellbeing, trust and psychological safety. A 2025 study exploring the impact of layoffs on employees within IT companies revealed that mass layoffs impacted employee engagement, loyalty, and organizational success. A 2022 study found that when companies didn’t meet employee expectations following downsizing, employee trust toward the organization was reduced as well as employee commitment and turnover intentions increased. Companies that must downsize should understand how to do it in a way that is ethical, empathetic and honors employee dignity. When layoffs are necessary, here are some best practices to consider: Companies should avoid faceless firing if possible, explained Tom Lakin in a 2022 Raconteurarticle. This type of firing lacks humanity and feels transactional. Lakin also suggested transparency as a necessary ingredient in your mass layoff strategy. Communicate with employees as much as possible why the layoffs are taking place (did the company over hire for example?) A 1994 article on ethical downsizing explained that employees should also be given as much advanced notice as possible, whenever possible, so they can plan accordingly. Candor, consistency and courtesy are the three C’s that managers should adopt and will go a long way during the layoff process. Layoffs are always going to be difficult; Those who are tasked with delivering the news of a layoff should be trained on ethical layoff practices. Mass layoffs can completely transform an organization. With the rise of AI and different industries experiencing financial strain due to varying factors, companies must figure out how to salvage employee trust and wellbeing. With more consumers considering how corporations treat employees in their buying decisions, gone are the days when companies could discard their employees without a second thought. In an era where more care and consideration are not only expected but demanded, staff reductions must be done in an ethical way that honors the dignity and humanity of every employee that is impacted. It’s not just the right thing to do; we live in a time when people are rising up and refusing to tolerate disrespect at the hands of corporations; the sustainability of any organization is determined by how well its employees are treated, especially during times of great change.

Title: Treasury Dept. says inflation is running 'above target' as Trump insists there is 'no inflation'
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-inflation-treasury-tariffs-rcna241696
Time Published: 2025-11-03T21:50:01Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Treasury Department said Monday that inflation "remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter," even as President Donald Trump and administration officials continue to assert that there is "no inflation." Speaking on CBS News' "60 Minutes" on Sunday, Trump said, "We have no inflation, we have no inflation." Trump claimed that he had "already taken care of" inflation, calling 2% "the perfect inflation." But inflation came in at 3% on an annual basis in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Food prices for both groceries (food at home) and food services (food away from home) increased moderately in the third quarter," Treasury said in a new "Economy Statement." The statement released Monday is a regular economic update prepared for the Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee. The committee consists of nonpartisan bond market executives from firms such as Citigroup, Pimco, JPMorgan and BlackRock, and provides input to the Treasury on government debt and financing issues. A White House spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Treasury statement. One of the major drivers of food inflation was record beef prices, due in part to lower herd counts. "We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs," Trump said Sunday on CBS. Overall, the Treasury Department said that "economic growth solidified in the third quarter with steady business investment and consumer demand." The third quarter is considered the three-month period from July 1 to Sept. 30. CEOs of retail and food companies have noted that while consumer spending overall continues at a decent pace, lower-income consumers are faring much worse than middle and upper income Americans. “Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits,” McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC in September. “We needed to step in.” Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, said the company also saw “divergency in spending between the income groups” last quarter. Wages for the average worker only slightly outpace inflation. As of August, median pay increased at a 4.1% rate, compared with inflation, which is pacing at 3.0% on an annual basis. Inflation has risen every month since April, when it was recorded at 2.3%. On the topic of the labor market, which many economists and analysts view as rapidly weakening, the Treasury said it sees the market for job seekers as "relatively steady" although "monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly." Employment growth "is below the roughly 100,000 jobs added per month in the first quarter of 2025," Treasury said. This "likely reflects the drop in population growth related to the forced and self-deportation of illegal immigrants." It further added that, "although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand." GDP, the primary measure of the country's economic output, rose 3.8% in the second quarter. Third-quarter GDP data was set to be released on Oct. 30, but has been delayed by the government shutdown. There also have been no official jobs reports since September due to the shutdown. Private payroll processor ADP said on Oct. 1 that private companies had shed 32,000 jobs in September. The delayed October jobs report could show another contraction. "Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025," the Treasury said. It noted that "the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment" due to the departure of federal employees who opted for deferred resignations earlier this year. Artificial intelligence could also play a role in the changing labor market dynamics. "Artificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to," the Treasury said. "Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage." "Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks," the report concluded. The Treasury said it would be "monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely" and said the administration would pursue "supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms" that it says will "protect the American consumer."

A linkup with an artificial intelligence player helped power shares of a top cloud-computing services company higher Monday, while an acquisition in the consumer goods space sent the two stocks on divergent paths. Major U.S. equities indexes ended the first trading day of November mixed, kicking off a market week that will bring a wave of big-name quarterly reports. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%. The Dow ended the session 0.5% lower. For more from Investopedia on the day's major market news, click here. IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit. The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings per share guidance, highlighting global customer adoption of its new diagnostic tools, which IDEXX says can help veterinarian teams increase clinical insights and streamline their workflows. Paper products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) said it would buy Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine parent company Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at around $49 billion. Kenvue, which completed a spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, has been navigating litigation over allegations that its talcum powder causes cancer and statements from the Trump administration linking Tylenol to autism. Kenvue shares rose more than 12% Monday following the announcement of the deal, which came at a significant premium to Friday's closing price for Kenvue stock, while Kimberly-Clark shares plunged more than 14%. The latter company's shares were the worst performers on the S&P 500 today. Amazon (AMZN) shares jumped 5% after ChatGPT owner OpenAI signed an agreement to buy more than $38 billion worth of capacity its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. OpenAI said the deal to use AWS infrastructure would provide it with access to a significant number of Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processing units that could be employed to train its AI models. Nvidia shares gained 2.2%. Moderna (MRNA) stock sank 8.3% Monday, reversing a portion of the gains posted last week amid reports that the vaccine maker had held strategic talks with a major pharmaceutical company about a potential partnership or sale. Waning enthusiasm around a possible deal and concerns about the company's financial situation overshadowed Moderna's announcement that it administered the first dose in an early stage study of its experimental multiple myeloma therapy. KeyBanc downgraded Charter Communications (CHTR) stock to "sector weight" from "overweight" after the cable and internet provider reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit in its most-recent quarterly release. Analysts cited competitive headwinds to Charter's broadband subscriber growth, which can affect its free cash flow. Its stock fell about 5%.

Title: The MMO being led by former WoW designer Greg Street looks to be dead as his studio officially closes after NetEase ends funding: 'While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment'

Greg Street said in October that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't secure new funding, and now the curtain has fallen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Less than a month after warning that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't find a new publisher for its in-development MMO, studio head Greg Street says the worst has come to pass, and the studio will close its doors on November 17. Street said in a message posted to LinkedIn that it's possible the studio will secure funding after that closure date, but "it will depend on how much of the team remains." "While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street wrote. He also thanked NetEase "for taking a chance on us." Street was heading up development of the League of Legends MMO when he opted to leave Riot Games in 2023 and launch Fantastic Pixel Castle to develop an all-new MMO for NetEase called Ghost. Fantastic Pixel Castle was one of several veteran-led studios launched by NetEase in 2022 and 2023, but the company took a sharp turn away from that strategy in late 2024, shuttering Worlds Untold, Jar of Sparks, T-Minus Zero, and now Fantastic Pixel Castle, all within the span of a single year. None of the closed studios was able to launch a single game. Sadly for Street's hope that Fantastic Pixel Castle employees will be able to find "stable" employment elsewhere, this sort of thing is not unique to NetEase. The past few years have seen thousands of game industry employees put out of work as studios of all sizes impose layoffs or close entirely, as the industry shifts away from the unsustainable excesses of the Covid-19 pandemic in favor of the unsustainable excesses of the AI bubble. October alone saw major layoffs at Amazon, Heart Machine, and Funcom, which also opted to close Metal: Hellsinger studio The Outsiders.

Title: Another MMO dead: ex-World of Warcraft and League of Legends lead's new studio "will close its doors" this month without releasing its flagship game Ghost

"Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Fantastic Pixel Castle, the indie studio from former League of Legends and World of Warcraft lead Greg Street, is closing. Street, who was previously World of Warcraft's lead systems designer, and then later lead gameplay designer on League of Legends and executive producer on Riot Games' elusive MMO, predicted last month that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't find a publisher for its flagship fantasy MMO, revealed in 2023 and codenamed Ghost. Well, unfortunately, Street's concerns have proven to be valid, as the MMO veteran announced on LinkedIn that "Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17." Street appeared to throw out a Hail Mary to potential investors who could still fund Ghost if enough of the studio sticks around despite the planned closure. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains," he said. "While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there." Fantastic Pixel Castle lost funding from NetEase last month, likely the catalyst to its closure following a weeks-long search for a new investor. Still, Street remained open to the possibility of a new backer in his announcement. "To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one," he wrote. This news follows closely on the heels of mass layoffs at Amazon and the end of new development on Amazon Games' MMO New World. In other words, it's been a rough few days for MMO fans, although there's still a small chance Ghost is funded before the studio shutdown.

Such adjustments include, but are not limited to, real estate optimization and transformation initiatives, certain litigation charges and loss contingencies, costs related to acquisitions/divestitures and the related amortization, impairment and related charges, depreciation, equity compensation, tax benefits, and other adjustments. For example, stock-based compensation may fluctuate based on the timing of employee stock transactions and unpredictable fluctuations in the company's stock price. Any associated estimate of these items and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

I started working at Amazon on October 26, 2020 after spending over 14 years writing documentation for open web developers at Mozilla. My five years at Amazon Web Services involved: I was a victim of the October, 2025 layoffs at Amazon, just days after my five-year anniversary with the company. Thus I’m looking for a new role as a technical writer, senior technical writer, developer documentation writer, or code example developer. It’s a strange feeling; I have not had to look for a job very many times in my career, and it certainly isn’t an easy feeling knowing that everything you say and do could affect your future in a very visceral way. But I’ve never had difficulty finding work in the past, and if it weren’t for the current shortage of good technical writing job openings, I’d have no concerns this time around. However, with the broad assumption by management at many companies that AI will do all the writing work, as well as other factors, it’s not generally a good market for prospective technical writing employees. In my favor is the fact that I’ve got years of experience writing at a variety of companies. From operating system tech (both desktop and mobile) to the open web to cloud technologies, I’ve done in-depth documentation in a broad spectrum of the developer documentation field. That’s a big point in my favor. So is my talent for reading and writing code in a variety of languages, and my ability to pick up new languages quickly as needed. Not in my favor is that I need a remote position. I’m not able to relocate and I live in an area without many large employers that might need developer documentation. But I’ve spent decades working entirely from home, so I’m well-versed in applying myself appropriately to my job in my home environment. I learned a great deal at AWS, including a good deal about working with AI tools. I’m nowhere near an expert, but at the pace AI tooling is currently evolving, I feel that few people truly qualify as “experts” unless learning about AI is the majority of what they do. The job search is just beginning. I’ll be sure to post updates as things progress. Here’s hoping that my streak of finding jobs quickly continues! You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: The Double Bind of the AI Bubble Means We’re Screwed Whether the Tech Succeeds or Fails

The stock market is largely being propped up by a promise of AI that has yet to deliver—setting up what could be a disastrous bubble. But the AI land rush isn’t merely a risky gamble. Wall Street is staking the health of the markets—and that of the broader economy with it—on a bet against the common good. It seems to be a lose-lose situation for those outside Wall Street and Silicon Valley: If the frenzied investment in artificial intelligence is overheated, as even OpenAI’s Sam Altman has warned, the markets could be hit hard enough to shake the economy as a whole—making an impact worse than that of the dot-com bust 25 years ago. But if the gamble pays off, it’ll mean a boom for a technology that could bring about widespread unemployment and social disruption. “If this works as fast as VC money seems to be hoping, society seems wholly unprepared for the consequences,” as Daniel Barcay, executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, tells Vanity Fair, citing potential mass unemployment and political instability. “If the market is over its skis, then what we’re likely to see is a race to the bottom of these dark monetization patterns. We were promised curing cancer, but we’re getting AI slop.” AI has already led to significant layoffs across a number of industries, including at Amazon, which announced it would slash 14,000 white-collar jobs last week. And Americans appear concerned that it’s just the beginning, with more than two thirds of respondents in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll worrying that swaths of the workforce could be permanently displaced. That’s for good reason: A report released by Senator Bernie Sanders last month (which ironically made use of ChatGPT) estimated that close to 100 million American jobs could be eliminated in 10 years by AI. Other reports have reached similar conclusions. And while not all the data is quite so pessimistic, purveyors of the technology themselves have warned about looming job losses: Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, cautioned in an interview with Axios earlier this year that the tech could get rid of half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. As he described the scenario, AI could mean “cancer is cured, the economy grows at 10% a year, the budget is balanced—and 20% of people don’t have jobs.” Amodei said he had an “obligation” to warn of the potential consequences of AI. But other AI leaders have outright framed such workforce reductions as a selling point for their tech: “Stop Hiring Humans,” read a controversial ad from AI start-up Artisan. Some of that can be dismissed as bluster. But then, the scale of the investment in AI right now may only be able to be justified if the hyperbolic predictions about AI come to pass. Roughly a third of the S&P is riding on just seven tech companies, which are trading at values that far exceed their revenues. “There have been numerous similarities between this bubble and the internet bubble of 1999–2000,” as Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, tells VF: Investors are taking “aggressive action,” he says, while “standard protocols and risk controls are at least partially sidelined due to the air of urgency created by the euphoria.” Except, as MarketWatch noted last month, AI is currently seeing 17 times more investment than there was in the dot-com mania at the turn of this century. For that investment to pay off, the technology needs to deliver on its society-altering promise. So far, it’s mostly delivering slop. Indeed, even as companies rush to integrate the technology into their operations, they aren’t seeing much return on investment thus far. A McKinsey report in June shared that while almost 8 in 10 companies are using AI, that same number report seeing little to no impact on their bottom lines. Other research paints an even bleaker picture: In August, an MIT study found that 95%—95!—of companies using AI pilots saw no return on their investments of $30 billion to $40 billion. And a Gartner survey of human resources leaders, released last week, found that 88% said their businesses had not seen much value from their AI initiatives. Investors’ hope, of course, is that this will change and the gains will materialize. But it’s far from guaranteed that they will. And if the bubble bursts, the fallout could be worse than that of the dot-com meltdown, given how much the fortunes of AI and the economy as a whole are now intertwined. With uncertainty from Donald Trump’s impulse-driven tariff regime, political chaos in Washington, and ominous headwinds on the horizon that have investors seeking refuge in stable assets like [gold](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/investors-are-so-confident-in-the-trump-economy-theyre-turning-to-gold?srsltid=AfmBOoo9cBcUb77xGTK94jVn97gHpTuUrjJzT_ZnoW1ggd0JilzSBJFB) and silver, the only thing that seems to be propping up the markets is investors’ belief in the future of AI. “Big Tech is spending big on AI data centers, often financing them with unsustainable debt that puts the financial system at risk,” Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a critic of both Silicon Valley and Wall Street and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, tells VF. “At the same time, we know that companies are already using AI to surveil workers’ every move and force schedules on them that maximize profits at the expense of their well-being. And the recent layoffs are a warning sign that AI could cause significant job losses.” “I worry that the Trump administration is asleep at the switch,” she adds. “Absent strong financial safeguards and labor practices, it’ll be workers, small businesses, and families who will pay the price.”

Title: So AI Is Coming For Your Job. We Have To Think About Jobs Differently

The Walrus Fact-based journalism that sparks the Canadian conversation When it comes to the future of work, there is only one certainty. Anyone who tells you that they know what is going to happen is either lying to you or trying to sell you something. We are in uncharted territory. And there is a lot of uncertainty. What we do know is that a lot is going to change. When I first started working on AI, there were three major camps when it came to thinking about jobs: Before ChatGPT, most people didn’t actually know much about how quickly deep learning was progressing. So position three was a pretty popular stance, and those who believed in option one were considered insane. But things have changed a lot in the past few years. Position three is now rarely discussed. It is just assumed that AI will have a massive impact on the labour market. And although position one is still quite taboo in academia, it is generally accepted as a possibility. But most researchers, myself included, fall into the category of position two. AI, in combination with advanced robotics research, has put a lot of jobs under the pressure of potential automation. Already, AI is being used in manufacturing, health care, therapy, management, programming, the arts, and construction, to name a few—it has basically penetrated every industry. In 2013, a now infamous Oxford University study predicted that approximately 47 percent of American jobs would be at risk of automation in the near future. The researchers may have been a little ambitious, but right now it’s not feeling like they were that far off. The reality is this: a lot of tasks that were traditionally considered to be safe from automation are no longer safe. Jobs that require artistic abilities or cognitive skills are now being automated. At the same time, the ability of machines to perform physical tasks is increasing as robots are fitted with AI systems that allow them to better sense and react to the world around them. AI’s automating powers are indiscriminate. They are affecting blue-collar manufacturing jobs and white-collar office jobs. Many who spent years, and thousands of dollars, developing specialized skills now need to live with the fact that AI can do their job faster and often better. It is a terrifying reality. What makes it even scarier is that we have no clue exactly how it is going to play out. There are just too many variables. For example, it is possible that a lot of companies will put off automating their staff and instead opt for retraining their current employees for new positions or finding ways to have them work with AI. This approach could spread out the potential economic disaster that would occur if there was suddenly mass unemployment due to rapid automation. Mass unemployment is bad (obviously) for a number of reasons. Economically, it presents a gigantic threat. If companies are producing more goods than ever due to automation, who’s going to buy them? There’s mass unemployment, and the people don’t have money to support businesses. Whether or not companies take this approach is not really in our hands. Even if they do, it’s possible that an unrelated financial recession will occur, forcing companies to lay off their employees, as is normal during a recession. However, this time, it may be different as they offset these layoffs by bringing in automation technology. Now, when the recession ends, the companies have no incentive to rehire their old employees. The prefabricated argument often used to confront fears of automation is that innovation inevitably creates new jobs. Although some jobs may be eliminated, the economic benefits of automation will create incentives for companies to create new jobs elsewhere in the economy; therefore, there is not actually anything to worry about! As much as I would love to believe in this take, as it is so comforting, it unfortunately does not hold up when put under the microscope. There are several major problems that emerge under scrutiny, even if we assume that this statement is partially true and that new jobs will materialize that we cannot foresee right now. The first problems are to do with speed and scale. When we typically talk about automation or innovation, it is in a very narrow sense. There may be a new innovation that automates a specific job in the dairy industry or in stock trading. But these instances are isolated. The automation in the dairy industry is not directly transferable to other industries. An automatic cow-milking system doesn’t have disruptive powers in other industries. However, the cost savings produced by the innovation could affect other parts of the industry. As production rises, the need for new jobs in other areas of the dairy industry may be created, offsetting the lost jobs milking cows. But AI is not a one-dimensional technology. It isn’t even a single piece of technology. It is a collection of technologies and methods for collecting and processing data that can be applied in numerous ways. It is not contained to a sole application. It is what’s known as a general-purpose technology. Other examples of general-purpose technologies are the internet, computers, and, most notably, the steam engine. General-purpose technologies cut across industries. They do not have a sole purpose but instead can be applied to an infinite number of tasks. They become productive forces that humans interact with, and leverage, to create and innovate. As it is a general-purpose technology, AI has the ability to disrupt countless industries at once. Where efficiencies in one area may have, at one time, resulted in new jobs in another, it is now possible that the other area will be experiencing the same efficiencies due to AI. Therefore, they may be creating some new jobs, but they will also be eliminating others. Although new jobs will be created to deal with AI, there is no certainty that they will replace all the jobs that are lost from the potential coming wave of automation. But scale is not the only problem with AI’s automation effects. Speed is also a major fear. AI developed in the shadows for a substantial period. Now that it has arrived in the mainstream, it seems to have entered with significant momentum, which means that it may hit countless segments of the economy fast and hard. Lots of people across industries may lose their jobs in a very short period of time. The creation of new jobs for the now unemployed workers will not happen as fast as the workers lose their jobs. In other words, if AI automation hits the job market hard and fast, we need to be prepared for a prolonged period between the layoffs and the emergence of new jobs. This period is likely to be both economically and mentally scarring for those who get caught in the middle. Sadly, this situation is not where the problems end. Again, even if we accept that new jobs will appear, and even if a miracle occurs and they appear jaw-droppingly fast, there is still a problem. The idea that new jobs will emerge brushes over the question of whether the new jobs will be appropriate for those who have lost their jobs. Not all jobs are the same. Due to the nature of AI, it is likely that it will heavily affect workers who are deemed to be “skilled workers.” This does not only mean people with a university education. It also includes those who perform tasks that traditionally require a large amount of acquired knowledge that is not common. This knowledge can be acquired through education or on-site experience. Workers are skilled because they have invested in themselves, acquiring this specialized knowledge. But now AI is able to acquire and act on the same knowledge. For many, massive investments they have made into acquiring knowledge and skills may be wiped out overnight. That doesn’t just mean financial investments in formal education but also years of practical work and experience that previously led to them being deemed skilled or valuable in the job market. The skills that will be needed for many of the new jobs that are created in a post–AI automation world will require fundamentally different skills to those which multiple generations have trained for. For many, massive investments they have made into acquiring knowledge and skills may be wiped out overnight. The skills gap that may be created could produce gigantic economic and social problems. Those who have their skills completely devalued by the economy will either need to retool or take low-skilled jobs. Low-skilled jobs will not be able to provide a standard of living or social status similar to what the previous jobs did. This downgrading will almost certainly lead to adverse mental effects and resentment of the system that betrayed these workers. That is doubly true for those who feel as if they did everything right. They did everything they were told to do to gain financial security, only to have it ripped out from under their feet. Imagine being forty-five years old with a young family and twenty-two years of work experience. Then, suddenly, you are told you need to start from the bottom. Your skills are no longer valuable. The further along you are in your career, the more devastating needing to retrain can be. However, it is not just those who are far along in their careers that are at risk. University education has long been positioned as the fastest and most efficient way to gain knowledge and skills that can set you apart. In countries such as the United States and Canada, students often take on substantial debt to fund their education. The rise of AI means that many skills taught at universities, especially in professional programs such as business, are being automated. This means that recent graduates may be saddled with massive amounts of debt for training that is now practically useless. For many, the option of retooling without specialized aid from the government will be impossible. Since they still need to eat, they will be forced to take a low-skilled job. Maybe they will be supervising a team of packing robots at an Amazon warehouse or cleaning rusty gears. Whatever they end up doing, the economic numbers will show them as being employed. But that is not the full story. Economic problems are often discussed in sterile terms. We talk about unemployment numbers and labour productivity. But it is so important to remember that behind each number is a person. That those numbers have souls, and that they love and are loved. How we as people experience the phenomenon of AI automation will affect us. It will shape our views and our values. The effects of automation can traumatize, demoralize, and even radicalize. And it is not just those who are economically displaced that are affected. Wealth inequality and economic despair affects us all. We do not live in an isolated society. What happens to your neighbours affects the world you live in too. Imagine being forty-five years old with twenty-two years of work experience. Then, suddenly, you need to start from the bottom. Moreover, financial struggles have massive effects on families. I was eleven years old when the great recession affected my family. For their privacy, I will shy away from the specific details. Yet I will be clear: I was deeply changed by what I experienced during that time. Even as my parents did their best to shield me, their youngest child, from what was happening, the effects were all too real. To be honest, that is one of the reasons I started researching AI. Although my work eventually strayed from examining the effects of AI on jobs, it is a topic that has always made me nervous. A storm is coming, and we need to prepare. We need to ask ourselves hard questions about what we want this transition to look like and make difficult choices about how we achieve it. And we need to do it fast. If there is one takeaway here, I hope it is this: even in a world dominated by machines, humans, and our decisions, are at the centre. Just as we build the machines and make decisions about how they are built, we build the systems that they are introduced into. We are not helpless bystanders when it comes to AI automation. We get to decide what the future of work looks like. We get to decide how we handle the great transition. A group who once understood this idea was the Luddites. They were skilled workers who became famous for destroying the new factory machinery that was automating their work. But the story of the Luddites is much more complicated than it is often made out to be. The Luddites were not anti-technology. In fact, many Luddites embraced the new technologies and were thrilled to work alongside them. What the Luddites feared was that their bosses would not use this technology to improve the products their customers received but to cheapen them, and that, at the same time, they’d gain more control over their workers. In the labour market, skilled workers have a lot of power. They can speak up for their rights and demand better conditions, because they are harder to replace. By contrast, unskilled workers are easily replaced or controlled. If the company’s desire is just to make money, unskilled workers are typically their preference. The factories that employed the Luddites could have functioned, and continued to make profits, without completely replacing their workers. Although they may not have needed every skilled worker they had before the automation, there were still opportunities to use the technology and pursue projects that required the skilled workers. At the end of the day, the battle the Luddites fought was one over economic and personal power. They were living through a transition similar to the one we are living through today, and they didn’t like the way it was being handled. They didn’t like the way technology was being used to cheapen production or the way it was devaluing those who worked with it and robbing them of the potential to take pride in their work by subjecting them to an existence as just another cog in a machine—a cog that could be thrown away by the powers that be if necessary. And they especially didn’t like the fact that the way these machines were being implemented was vesting massive amounts of social, economic, and political power into the hands of those who owned them. The Luddites were living through one of the last great societal transformations, the Industrial Revolution. There is no definitive start or end date for the Industrial Revolution. But it marks the period of human history when we completely transformed the ways we made things. Before the Industrial Revolution, we mostly made stuff by hand. Tools were used, but they were simple and needed to be wielded by someone who understood them. A large majority of the population worked as farmers, and they used their physical brawn and knowledge of the land to till the fields and feed the community. But then the Industrial Revolution began. New technologies such as the steam engine and water wheels made it possible to mechanize production. But the way production was mechanized was not set in stone. It was driven by human ideologies about how work should be done and what kind of work would lead to a better world. Ideas about cutting costs and increasing production led to increased de-skilling of work. As more machines were introduced, humans began to be treated more like machines. Jobs were divided into small repetitive tasks. Instead of constructing a whole shoe, a worker would spend their day making the same boot part hundreds of times, every day. The Industrial Revolution can be remembered through two competing images. On one side, it was the beginning of a gilded age. The machines of industry harnessed the productive force of society, and we began producing more goods than ever. We unlocked the potential of man and machine and built unthinkable wealth. It gave us the ability to provide more riches for everyone. But it was also a time of great suffering, when thousands were forced off their farms or pushed out of professions in which they had found deep meaning. Communities were shattered, and rural populations were forced into the slums of the cities to find work. With no skills, workers had little power and worked for pennies. Those who owned the factories hoarded vast wealth and understood the power their positions gave them. Corruption was rampant, and they worked hard to maintain their place at the top of the hierarchy. Children worked in factories and starved in the streets. But they were employed. Most members of society had jobs, but were they really living? It wasn’t uncommon to work ten to sixteen hours a day, six days a week, just to make ends meet. But it didn’t need to be this way. The future of work is not predetermined. It is up to us to decide how we navigate this uncharted territory. We as a society made choices about how the technology of the Industrial Revolution was to be used. We could have chosen a path that valued the worker and aimed to reduce suffering and distribute the benefits of increased production more evenly. Instead, we often chose efficiency and profit over human dignity and community. The story of the Industrial Revolution, like the story of the Luddites, is a reminder of the power of human agency in the face of technological change. It’s a cautionary tale that highlights the importance of making conscious choices about how we integrate new technologies into our society, ensuring that they serve to enhance human well-being rather than diminish it. As we stand on the brink of another transformative period, driven by AI, we are faced with similar choices. But this time, we have the past to learn from. We can see how the Industrial Revolution played out and ask, “Do we want to do that again?” Will we repeat the mistakes of the past, allowing technological progress to exacerbate inequality, displace workers without offering viable alternatives, and concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few? Or will we learn from history and steer this technological revolution in a direction that benefits all of society? The great transition we are undertaking is not just about the role of AI in the economy. It is not just about our jobs. It’s about who we decide we want to be. It’s about how we, as a society, choose to respond to the challenges and opportunities AI presents. It’s about the kind of world we want to live in and the values we want to guide us. The future of work is not predetermined. How we will live with AI is not etched in stone. It is up to us to decide how we navigate this uncharted territory, ensuring that the journey leads to a destination where technology serves humanity, and not the other way around.

IREN (IREN) shares jumped to an all-time high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Shares of IREN were up over 8% near $66 in recent trading after reaching an intraday high of $75.73 earlier in the session. Shares of Microsoft were little changed. The company said the deal would give Microsoft access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips in its data centers over five years. IREN also said it struck a deal to purchase related Nvidia chips and ancillary equipment from Dell Technologies (DELL) for about $5.8 billion. IREN said it plans to pay for all the capital expenditures involved by “a combination of existing cash, customer prepayments, operating cashflows and additional financing initiatives.” IREN, like some other Bitcoin miners, has pivoted to focus more of its business on providing AI infrastructure to capitalize on the boom in demand for computing. Co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts said that the Microsoft agreement represents “another major step forward for IREN as we continue to expand large-scale GPU deployments across our 3GW secured power portfolio in North America.” With Monday's gains, IREN shares are up close to 600% for 2025.

Title: A ‘jobless profit boom’ has cemented a permanent loss in payrolls as AI displaces labor at a faster rate, strategist says
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/03/ai-jobless-profit-boom-permanent-payroll-loss-labor-replacement/

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Booming corporate earnings and a slumping labor market have been telling very different stories lately, and AI is the likely explanation, according to Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at Alpine Macro. That dichotomy is exemplified in the tech sector, which has seen profits soar while employment has been in a “recession” for three years, he said in a Monday note titled “A Jobless Profit Boom.” “We suspect that job losses in tech have been driven mainly by AI displacement,” Zhao added, pointing to recent cuts at Amazon, Meta and Salesforce. “These layoffs, however, are happening amid exceptionally strong profit growth in these companies—a significant departure from the past, when job cuts typically followed declining profitability.” This jobless profit boom isn’t limited to the tech sector and has quickly become an economy-wide phenomenon, he said. In fact, while overall private-sector payrolls have rebounded from the early days of COVID, it is still 5% below where the pre-pandemic trend would have been by this time. “In other words, there has been a permanent loss of jobs since the pandemic crisis, even as corporate profits have surged to record highs,” Zhao said. At the same time, productivity has been surging in recent years, and it is currently growing more than twice as fast as it did in the previous decade. Zhao thinks AI is the reason and noted the technology is displacing labor at an accelerating pace. But while labor demand is down, aging demographics and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown have weakened labor supply as well. Those trends have created a new equilibrium that are keeping a lid on unemployment even as hiring stays subdued. “Under normal circumstances, slower labor force growth should weigh on economic growth,” Zhao explained. “However, rising productivity has allowed the U.S. economy to produce more output—and higher profits—with fewer workers.” The analysis from Alpine Macro, which is part of Oxford Economics, reinforces what computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton has been saying about AI’s impact on the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: OpenAI, Amazon sign $38bn AI deal
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/3/openai-amazon-sign-38bn-ai-deal
Time Published: 2025-11-03T18:13:50Z

The announcement comes less than week after Amazon laid off 14,000 people. By Andy Hirschfeld and Reuters Share Save OpenAI has signed a new deal valued at $38bn with Amazon that will allow the artificial intelligence giant to run AI workloads across Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. The seven-year deal announced on Monday is the first big AI push for the e-commerce giant after a restructuring last week. The new deal will give the ChatGPT maker access to thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its artificial intelligence models. Experts say this does not mean that it will allow OpenAI to train its model on websites hosted by AWS – which includes the websites of The New York Times, Reddit and United Airlines. “Running OpenAI training inside AWS doesn’t change their ability to scrape content from AWS-hosted websites [which they could already do for anything publicly readable]. This is strictly speaking about the economics of rent vs buy for GPU [graphics processing unit] capacity,” Joshua McKenty, CEO of the AI detection company PolyguardAI, told Al Jazeera. The deal is also a major vote of confidence for the e-commerce giant’s cloud unit, AWS, which some investors feared had fallen behind rivals Microsoft and Google in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Those fears were somewhat eased by the strong growth the business reported in the September quarter. OpenAI will begin using AWS immediately, with all planned capacity set to come online by the end of 2026 and room to expand further in 2027 and beyond. Amazon plans to roll out hundreds of thousands of chips, including Nvidia’s GB200 and GB300 AI accelerators, in data clusters built to power ChatGPT’s responses and train OpenAI’s next wave of models, the companies said. Amazon already offers OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock, which offers multiple AI models for businesses using AWS. OpenAI’s sweeping restructuring last week moved it further away from its non-profit roots and also removed Microsoft’s first right to refusal to supply services in the new arrangement. Amazon’s announcement about an investment in AI comes only days after the company laid off 14,000 people despite CEO Andy Jassy’s comment in an earnings call on Thursday saying the layoffs were not driven by AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said the startup is committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources – enough to roughly power 25 million United States homes. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” said Altman. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” This comes amid growing concerns about the sheer amount of energy demand that AI data centres need to operate. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that AI data centres will use up to 12 percent of US electricity by 2028. An AP/NORC poll from October found that 41 percent of Americans are extremely concerned about AI’s impact on the environment, while another 30 percent say they are somewhat concerned as the industry increases its data centre footprint around the US. Surging valuations of AI companies and their massive spending commitments, which total more than $1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom may be turning into a bubble. OpenAI has already tapped Alphabet’s Google to supply it with cloud services, as Reuters reported in June. It also reportedly struck a deal to buy $300bn in computing power for about five years. While OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft, which the two forged in 2019, has helped push Microsoft to the top spot among its Big Tech peers in the AI race, both companies have been making moves recently to reduce reliance on each other. Neither OpenAI nor Amazon were immediately available for comment. On Wall Street, Amazon’s stock is surging on the news of the new deal. As of 11:15am in New York (16:15 GMT), it is up by 4.7 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Updated: 11/03/25 There has never been a bigger moment in history when brand differentiation was more important. The channels we relied on for growth are saturated and increasingly less effective. And with AI changing how people search and make buying decisions, the race to stand out has never been more brutal. The brands at the top of the food chain are those we associate with a specific problem. For example, if I want running shoes, I go to Hoka. For skincare, I’m a Byoma girlie, and if I’m craving apple juice, Innocent cures my thirst. But how do these brands differentiate in a crowded market space? What makes them so memorable? In this article, I’ll share my favorite examples of companies smashing brand differentiation and give you actionable tips on how to stand out from the crowd. Table of Contents Brand differentiation is how you carve out mental real estate in a market where everyone‘s screaming for attention. It’s not just your logo, your tagline, or your mission statement. It's the specific reason someone chooses you over a competitor when both products could technically solve their problem. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Differentiator: Product-led growth that turns customers into advocates In a previous Moz Whiteboard Friday, I said the most important way to build brand authority is to have a great product. There’s no workaround for this. A great product keeps people in-app and coming back. That’s why I love Revolut. When I moved to the UK in 2022 and needed a banking solution, all my friends pointed me to the app. Revolut offered multicurrency accounts backed by frictionless banking, and I’d never seen anything like it. It feels like an everyday app that combines banking, investment, and features you’d only get on a typical credit card. A great product feels two steps ahead of you. It anticipates your needs, offers features before you ask, and gets you from A to Z with ease. Here’s how Revolut differentiates from other neobanks: No amount of advertising or marketing spend can save a bad product. Invest in your core experience. Build features that meet the standard, and go further with future-forward innovation that keeps people in the app. Differentiator: A unique blend of education, design, and storytelling I first heard about Better Trail’s content in the TOFU community when David Broderick used them as an example of intuitive content. So, I took a look, and I was thoroughly impressed. Google is starting to surface longer answers through AI Overviews and AI Mode, cannibalizing traffic that would usually go to websites. Better Trail, a review site that depends on traffic and commissions for survival, is doing something different to attract and keep users. Here’s how Better Trail differentiates from other review sites: The UX is amazing, and I love how it makes the content look more like a magazine than a blog post. If you want to quickly scan the recommendations, they've got you with skim. Source Need a little bit more detail? Choose medium. And if you have time to read the entire thing, they've got a 14,000-word banger for you. Better Trail skips all the unnecessary SEO optimization of “what is” and “how to.” The site instead goes straight to an overview of hiking shoe superlatives, so you can quickly make a choice. Source When buying a hiking shoe, you look for specific features, like comfort, foot protection, and durability. Better Trail uses a scoring system to rate each feature, making it easy to choose based on what's important to you. Source Basically, they've provided the information people look for when buying a product and removed barriers that prevent a sale, all in one go. You’re not going to capture and hold attention if your content looks like everyone else’s. You need a format that feels fresh and unique. Anticipate the decisions people are trying to make and give them answers before they even know what to ask. Finally, structure your content so it works for scanners, researchers, and power users alike. Differentiator: Turning internal SMEs into multi-channel influencers Revenue Intelligence is a heavily saturated niche with many competitors providing similar feature sets. Gong sits within that niche as one of the most expensive options. So, the brand differentiates and captures market share by prioritizing relationships and human-led conversations, not just pricing or features. Source I haven’t seen another brand lean into LinkedIn the way Gong has with its internal SMEs. The first time I heard about Gong was through Udi Ledergor’s LinkedIn content. He was so engaging that I had to check out his profile. Since then, I’ve seen other internal SMEs, like Brian LaManna (104k), JC Pollard (48k), and others post thoughtful, relevant content. Their target audience (sales leaders) spends a lot of time on LinkedIn, so it makes sense for Gong’s AEs and marketing leaders to build a presence there. Source They also show up through activation events like the Celebrate Conference, which platforms Gong’s leadership team alongside external experts. Source In addition, there are ongoing webinars. These digital gatherings are usually co-hosted by one Gong SME and a known industry voice. The brand also hosts smaller in-person events that create space to interact with its audience. It’s brilliant, really. People trust people, and Gong empowers their internal experts to build thought leadership and stay top of mind. Identify experts within your company who want to grow their personal profiles and leverage them to strengthen the overall brand image. Allow them to speak in their own voice, and don’t try to censor their content. Create a program that helps them spread their influence externally through podcasts, webinars, and even public speaking. If they show up in the places your audience is already hanging out, that’s a win for your brand. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand.

Differentiator: Inclusive products and campaigns that ensure holistic representation Before Fenty, beauty brands got away with exclusion for decades. Deeper foundation shades were an afterthought and rarely existed. Even worse, the people creating products for BIPOC women weren’t part of our communities, and it showed in the existing range. Rihanna saw the gap and built Fenty to close it. Source She launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 with 40 foundation shades on day one because she knew what it felt like not to find your shade of makeup in the store. Personally, I was excited! She was a disruptor, making inclusive products that customers had been begging for, but no one had created. And suddenly, brands that had never prioritized inclusivity scrambled to expand their shade ranges. Source It’s a smart move because Fenty wasn’t trying to compete with the big names. They focused on creating products for BIPOC women with shades you couldn’t find elsewhere, which allowed them to carve a niche for themselves. Within 40 days of launching, Fenty had $100,000,000 in revenue, proof that there is a market for diverse beauty products. But, it’s not just inclusive shades. Fenty has consistently featured plus-size models, disabled models, and talent from across the gender spectrum. Source Everyone gets to see themselves in Fenty because the brand is intentional about representation. It also helps that Rihanna uses her personal brand to maximize visibility for Fenty. She makes tutorials showing people how to use the products, which builds a sense of ownership and community around every launch. Source However, this only worked because the product is fantastic. Fenty also gives back through the Clara Lionel Foundation to fund climate resilience, health initiatives, and education for marginalized communities. You can’t just add a value or mission statement to your website and call it an inclusive brand. You need to start at the product level and ensure that your target audience is represented in the internal teams. Representation and trust go hand in hand. When done right, they build a movement that turns customers into brand evangelists. Differentiator: A tool that’s seamlessly embedded in everyday workflows There’s a YouTube video from 2018 where Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, talks about what makes a great product. He says, “If a product is so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, you’ve already done 80% of the work.” Friends, I’ve been on the train, in the air, and on the beach, and at each of these locations, someone was talking about ChatGPT. There’s a pattern I’m seeing as I write this article, where the best brand differentiators are disruptors that innovate with a product so good, it turns the industry on its head. OpenAI has done that with every product they’ve launched, including: Specifically, ChatGPT has become an everyday app. For example, I use it to find healthy recipes, troubleshoot issues with my washing machine, automate content workflows, and even help with fundraising for my nonprofit, The FCDC. OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Pulse. Pulse will deliver personalized updates based on the user’s behavior. In my opinion, this new feature increases app usage and further embeds ChatGPT as part of people’s daily routine. Source Brands that differentiate are those whose products become habits. Habit is how you rank in the user’s mind before they start a search. You want to be the first name out of their mouth when a friend asks for a recommendation. The most powerful form of differentiation is when your users do the marketing for you. Focus on building a product so good, people evangelize without incentive. Differentiator: Punk rock branding for canned water Water is essential to life. It’s something we’re all told to drink more of, yet not everyone enjoys it. A poll by CivicScience revealed that nearly half of U.S. adults consume far below the recommended amount of eight glasses per day. Source The core problem is that many people don’t see water as something they want but as a routine they’re supposed to do. Liquid Death set out to break the mold when they launched in 2019. In a U.S. market flooded with nearly 3,000 bottled water brands, the brand found white space by making water fun. Every time I hear the word “liquid death,” I imagine myself swinging a solid-body electric guitar and playing with Brian May. That’s the brand image that Liquid Death has built. Instead of clean, serene packaging, they gave us tallboys with flaming skulls and taglines like “Murder your thirst.” Source Their content is ridiculous, in the best way. They’ve dropped a metal album about hydration, launched a kids' cartoon called “Murderverse,” and even paid people to get Liquid Death tattoos. Source And, it works. Liquid Death now has over 14 million followers on Instagram and TikTok. In 2024, they pulled in over $333 million in retail sales, up 26% from $263 million the year before. While most CPG brands are still trying to figure out how to connect with Gen Z and Millennials, Liquid Death has already built a cult following. The brand shows that an anti-corporate tone can work. One reason people don't connect with branded content is because it's not engaging. Often, interactions feel faceless and boring. Make your brand fun. Liquid Death’s content works because it’s true to their brand and carries over into their product, marketing, and brand identity. Even water can become a habit when it’s marketed in an engaging way. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. These steps are based on principles from “The Difference Engine”. This is a model of differentiation best practices founded by HubSpot Diamond Solutions partner, Articulate Marketing. To start, let’s view the eight steps from a high level. Then, we’ll dive into the details, along with examples you can use to inspire your own efforts. Google’s mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. This Google example showcases a few key elements to help you define your mission: Your mission should be a central goal. From here, you can position your products and services, build out yearly goals, quarterly objectives and metrics for success, and develop your strategies. This is the first step. You’ll want to use this structure to define your ambitions. Once you’ve identified your mission, everyone in your business will be singing from the same song sheet. Your collective voice will carry. Stations play your tune on the radio, the album goes platinum, you become the next Adele of … HealthTech. It’s all within reach if you make it your mission to get there. There are two sides to any brand. The first is the brand identity as it relates to customers. The second is how your brand is positioned within your community, as an employer, and as a global citizen. In other words, the culture of your company. Too many organizations pay lip service to culture. They offer basic benefits and post a “values” chart on the wall. It’s not enough. Talented employees will go elsewhere. But employees that enjoy a great company culture are 3.8 times more likely to be engaged. And engaged and talented people make for an exceptional business. In fact, clients are starting to pay attention to workplace culture, too, because they want to work with happy, supported, and empowered teams — while also having business partners who are committed to shared values. It’s no longer just about cost and results, but about the types of companies people want to partner with for the long-term. Recommendation: Consider third-party certifications, as provided by the likes of Investors in People and B Corp. Their evaluations leave nowhere to hide, so they keep you honest. Such certifications are the evidence that you really do business differently. The best businesses use the best tools. Take Ecologi’s story as an example. Ecologi has established a fantastic brand differentiation strategy. They offer unparalleled transparency around carbon offsetting and tree planting with technology that showcases the great work they do. Their climate-positive mission is timely and well-targeted. What they offer is in-demand given the current environmental crisis. So they began experiencing rapid growth. Businesses want to do their part to achieve net zero. Ecologi provides the means to get there. Although they had experienced success with HubSpot Sales Hub, they relied on multiple systems for marketing. This meant valuable data was falling through the cracks. They had limited marketing intelligence and patchy lead capture compliance. Any changes relied on dev support. Once they were successfully brought onto HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, however, their team found they could track lead sources as well as align their marketing and sales processes. By making the most of the tools, they saw accelerated results. Now, they can personalize campaigns to target sectors, extend their reach, and grow their reputation as a brand. That example is just one way that tools empower a brand to stand head-and-shoulders above the rest. So, step three: audit your toolkit. You want to have a strategic blueprint for all elements of your content and communications. These are the core guides for your positioning. A strategic blueprint is an up-to-date document that everyone in your organization can access. It’s up to you what you need a blueprint for. Most businesses will have these: Consistency is integral to differentiation. If you have a consistent brand, then it’s going to be easier to recognize, whether your audience is reading a Tweet or watching a video. These strategic blueprints should be applied with such regularity and enthusiasm that an outsider could guess their contents. Let’s put that idea into practice. Try this exercise. Take one of these strong brands that you’re familiar with and sketch out a persona and the journey they go on to buy, three key messages, five attitude words and a couple of notable styles, such as the use of formal/informal words: Once you’ve done that, try to do the same for your business. Step five is all about establishing your visual brand. This is a huge topic, but let’s ask ourselves some key questions. When did you last update your logo? Is it simple, modern, and legible? Do you have a well-defined visual style throughout your website and other channels? Are things like your fonts and color palette defined in a brand book? Has your website been updated in the last couple of years? Does it accurately reflect your services and your story? Is it fast loading and easy to navigate? Like with strategic blueprints, consistency is vital. If you have a consistent visual brand, then it’s more likely to become familiar with your audience. Therefore, they will remember who you are. Source Beyond Encryption, a secure communications provider, took their visual branding a step further than most companies. Rather than having one logo and one colorway, they chose to develop a whole brand family. Each of their product lines has its own logo and design profile; they are harmonious, yet distinct. They all flow from the same brand methodology, with the main site brand and logo as the “parent.” Beyond Encryption uses this brand family to target segmented audiences while maintaining a clear, differentiated brand. Thought leadership is a tactic content marketers use to build credibility for themselves or leaders in their company. Essentially, thought leadership is brand positioning based on expertise. The good thing about expertise is, unlike positioning based on price, it’s something you can leverage in a unique and thought-provoking way. It’s the route to long-term positioning that you build over time, rather than a quick and dirty race to the bottom. Real experts have knowledge and opinions that other people are interested in learning about. Businesses with in-house experts can differentiate themselves by creating thought leadership content, like blogs and white papers, leveraging their expertise. This helps you establish credibility with your audience. What we don’t suggest, however, is positioning based on the concept of expertise (“I’m an expert, so trust me”). Thought leaders demonstrate their expertise in tangible ways. They have certifications, and are evidence-based. They don’t just say they are experts. They show it. The other mistake people sometimes make is to confuse expertise with complexity. This means filling your content with obscure jargon about your services. That’s not going to work, either. As Einstein put it, “If you can‘t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Once you’ve got your thought leadership content out into the world, you can expect to see a growing audience coming to your website. From there, you want to capture contact details, such as people’s names and email addresses. Here is another opportunity to differentiate yourself. The lead generation and nurturing process is where you start to see real engagement with your brand. It’s your chance to build a relationship with prospects. So many businesses drop the ball here. They miss opportunities to get leads. Or they dive right into pushy sales tactics once they do get them. Here’s an alternative approach: Lastly, let’s talk optimization. Sir David Brailsford leads Britain’s first ever professional cycling team. At the 2008 Olympics, his team won the majority of gold medals in track cycling and did the same at the next Olympics. Sir David Brailsford told Harvard Business Review, “It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” You don’t necessarily need to shake up your whole brand to differentiate your business. You can simply make small improvements that, over time, make a big difference. In marketing, this means observing what works, tracking and measuring the data, testing variants, and implementing the better option, every time. That’s how you go for gold. These eight steps to brand differentiation are definitely not for the risk averse. But they are for ambitious companies and leaders who have a growth mindset. The difference between you and every other business out there is that you’re willing to take the first step. You have to bake your differentiating element into your brand from day one. It can’t be an afterthought. The brands winning today built products that form habits, tell stories worth sharing, and live their mission like a second skin.

Title: Target Is Acting Like A Company Preparing For Acquisition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2025/11/03/target-is-acting-like-a-company-preparing-for-acquisition/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T17:56:26Z
Full Content:
ByChris Walton, Senior Contributor. Target and Amazon each announced layoffs on the same day last week. Tuesday, October 28th, to be exact. Coincidence? I think . . . it is more than likely. But what if it’s not? What if there is more at play here? What if it is a big tell that Amazon could be looking to acquire Target? Or, minimally, that Target is looking to get acquired itself? While this idea might sound crazy, there is more than enough chum in the water to give it credence. First of all, for years people have been hypothesizing that Target would make a great acquisition for Amazon. The first instance I can recall occurred way back in 2018 when Loup Venture’s Gene Munster predicted the e-commerce giant would buy Target. Obviously, that never happened, but ever since then too many pundits to count have encouraged the move, mainly because they all see a synergy with Whole Foods and Target. Newsflash: I do not, but more on that in just a few seconds. No, the far more strategic rationale for a Target acquisition plays right into what Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said late last week. In discussing the success Amazon has been seeing with the rollout of same-day perishable grocery delivery, Jassy said, “This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours.” Sound familiar? It should. Because it sounds exactly why people shop at Target, only the online version of the experience. If I had a nickel for every time someone during my Target career said to me, “I went in for one thing, and left with so much more!” I estimate that, give or take, I’d have about $5,325 by now. Target’s grocery experience has never been designed like Walmart’s or even Kroger’s. Target has never been the place where you can accomplish your full weekly grocery shopping trip. Sure, there are roughly 200 or so Super Targets throughout the country that approximate the Walmart Supercenter experience, but there are also about 1,800 other stores with a much smaller footprint of groceries, with no meat counter, no deli, etc. Said another way, Target has always been about the fill-in grocery trip. Smashing Whole Foods into Target for that reason alone would be a bad move. The stores don’t have the footprint and the retrofit would be quite costly. Second, Target’s supply chain design, i.e. the expansive use of sortation centers, was also designed by ex-Amazon and Target’s former Chief Supply Chain Officer, Arthur Valdez. It is a setup Amazon knows well and one to which Amazon could plug into quite nicely, and one that suddenly gives all its Amazon’s shoppers an “omnichannel” extension into the idea of buying (or picking up at a store) your “milk alongside your electronics.” But all that is just the Amazon side of the story. The recent happenings around Target’s CEO succession are so bizarre that they should give everyone pause, pause to ask, “What the heck is going on here?” For instance, Target’s outgoing CEO Brian Cornell’s track record is questionable at best (see why here), and instead of the board outright replacing him, it allowed Cornell to stay in his role until February 1, 2026 and named Target’s former COO Michael Fiddelke as his replacement, with Cornell then staying on as executive chair. Many, including Wall Street, were hoping the board would look outside for Cornell’s replacement, but instead it went internal and kept Cornell in the mix. Why would the board do this? Well, one reason could be that the board knows something we don’t and doesn’t want to upset the apple cart, an idea that deserves even more credence when we examine the layoffs last week. For all intents and purposes, last week’s layoffs were Fiddelke’s layoffs. Ever since Target announced its succession plan in late August, Fiddelke has been the public leadership face of Target. Knowing retail as I do, however, layoffs of this size and magnitude take months and months of planning, which also means that they had to have been in the works long before the succession announcement was made. All of which begs the next big question – why didn’t Cornell announce the layoffs and then hand over the reins to Fiddelke sometime afterward? Or even time the layoffs earlier? That would have been the move that set Fiddelke up for success. Instead Fiddelke gets saddled with the cultural impact of having to tell the organization that the reason for the layoffs was one of “too many layers and overlapping work slowing decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life,” a rationale that, as the former CFO and COO, Fiddelke had a big hand in creating. Is Fiddelke the right man to lead Target for the long-term, or is he just a temporary stopgap who understands the operations and who, with Cornell peering over his shoulder, can hold things in place until the right suitor comes along? If it is the latter, then Fiddelke is actually the ideal candidate to fulfill the role. He knows the internal workings of Target as well if not better than anyone still working there. If it is the former, then I don’t envy him one bit because Cornell handed him a raging dumpster fire, and it will take a superhero’s effort to bring the culture back and to fix the overall flailing business model at the same time. I asked Target for comment on all this speculation, both on the timing of the layoffs with Amazon as well as on the idea of Target’s leadership team preparing the company for acquisition, but my request for comment was not returned in time for publication. But then again, if any of the speculation were true, why would and, more importantly, how could Target comment? Target couldn’t comment even if it wanted to do so. No matter how one slices it, the situation is so strange at Target right now that, for the benefit of the doubt for all who still work there (Fiddelke included), one has to assume Target is clearing the decks for acquisition, right? What other possible explanation could there be? Because any answer beyond that gets really unsettling, really fast, and doesn’t inspire much confidence in what would result from the proverbial inmates left running the asylum, aka Target’s board and leadership team.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Caterpillar (CAT) has been a standout performer in the industrial sector, buoyed by optimism around infrastructure spending and a resilient U.S. economy. Yet, after a sharp rally, investors are asking the key question — has the stock run too far, too fast? CAT stock has surged 10% over the last week and is presently trading at $577.26. Our comprehensive evaluation indicates that it might be prudent to consider selling CAT stock. Overall, we maintain a negative outlook on the stock, and a price of $404 could very well be achievable. We feel there are several concerns regarding CAT stock considering its overall Weak operational performance and financial health.

Title: All Roads Lead To NVIDIA: Bankrolling Its Own AI Gold Rush

ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. NVIDIA just wrote a $5 billion check for a stake in Intel. It's the AI gold rush in microcosm: the biggest winner is now bankrolling its own boom. The Intel deal is one small piece of an extraordinary surge. In 2025, through October, nearly one trillion dollars in AI infrastructure commitments has surfaced: $500 billion from Stargate alone; approximately $150 billion in NVIDIA-driven strategic and supply commitments; and a cascade of hyperscaler, private-equity, and sovereign GPU procurement moving at unprecedented velocity. This isn't a tech cycle. It's a capital reordering. And it reveals a fundamental power shift—the company at the center of the AI buildout is now funding it. Every boom has two sides: those writing checks and those cashing them. The spenders? Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. Over $750 billion in datacenter spending between 2023 and 2025. Nearly $400 billion in 2025 alone. In recent earnings calls on October 29–30, 2025, all four signaled plans to increase spending materially in 2026. And the investor base is multiplying. Private equity firms are raising billion-dollar AI infrastructure funds. Investment banks are structuring datacenter acquisitions. Sovereign wealth funds are locking in GPU capacity years in advance. The recipients span the entire infrastructure stack: GPUs, memory, networking, cooling, and power. Plenty of companies are winning on volume. But one company captured the lion's share—NVIDIA. 80–95% of the AI accelerator market. 70–80% gross margins. Between 2023 and 2025, revenue surged from $27B to $130B while market value exploded nearly tenfold. NVIDIA didn't just participate in the AI boom. It won. Now, with a war chest built from these sales, NVIDIA is deploying capital strategically to control both supply and demand in the infrastructure buildout. Unlike traditional VCs who simply take equity stakes, NVIDIA takes equity and turns portfolio companies into GPU customers locked into its ecosystem. The pattern repeats across the portfolio. In July 2023, a $50 million investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals enabled the biotech firm to build BioHive-2, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD supercomputer with 504 H100 GPUs, completed in May 2024. By mid-2025, Perplexity AI, backed by NVIDIA since April 2024, was likely deploying Blackwell GPUs for its AI search engine, consistent with NVIDIA’s strategy of providing early access to its latest hardware. The loop is elegant: NVIDIA Invests Capital and Takes Equity → Portfolio Companies Buy GPUs → Additional GPU Revenue → Portfolio Equity Appreciates → Larger War Chest → Repeat. Each investment converts to infrastructure deployment. Each partnership locks in ecosystem adoption, creating a reinforcing cycle where NVIDIA effectively funds its own customer base. On March 10, 2025, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced a figure on an earnings call that stunned analysts: $48 billion in new cloud contracts signed in a single quarter, the largest booking quarter in the company's history. The backlog hit $130 billion, up 63% year-over-year. Then came the kicker: those numbers didn't even include Stargate. The $500 billion OpenAI-Oracle-SoftBank megaproject announced two months earlier wasn't included in the reported backlog. By late September, Stargate had committed more than $400 billion and secured seven gigawatts of capacity. An even larger wave followed. Between mid-September and late October 2025, the AI infrastructure market detonated with hundreds of billions more in commitments. Anchoring the blitz: NVIDIA and OpenAI's up to $100 billion letter of intent for 10 gigawatts of compute, with the first gigawatt online mid-2026. Flanking it: CoreWeave signing $36.6 billion in five days—$22.4 billion with OpenAI, $14.2 billion with Meta. AMD locking in 6 gigawatts with OpenAI. Broadcom securing another 10 gigawatts of custom ASICs starting late 2026. NVIDIA is directing capital to reinforce its AI ecosystem moat. $5 billion into Intel, $2 billion into xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer, $1 billion for a Nokia stake. Then came the deal that revealed the whole game: a BlackRock-led consortium, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, and xAI, spending $40 billion to acquire Aligned Data Centers. It wasn't a traditional tech acquisition—it was a buy-the-grid play. They weren't buying a business; they were buying power, land, and priority access to the electrical future. This isn’t a spending cycle. It's an arms race for computational sovereignty—and the infrastructure is sold out before it's even built. The numbers are staggering, yet the mechanics are variations on a single, ruthlessly efficient playbook. Flywheel one—equity appreciation: In April 2023, NVIDIA invested $100 million in CoreWeave at a $2 billion valuation. Added another $250 million at the March 2025 IPO at $40 per share. Total investment: $350 million. CoreWeave now trades around $135 per share. NVIDIA's stake: roughly $3.3 billion. Nearly 10× on its initial position. As CoreWeave lands customer contracts, that equity value climbs. Flywheel two—GPU revenue: To fulfill those contracts, CoreWeave buys hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. Each purchase generates chip revenue for NVIDIA. The rising revenue and equity value help enable more investments, accelerating the loop. The structure is nearly bulletproof. Heads, NVIDIA wins. Tails, NVIDIA still wins. What's unusual about the CoreWeave relationship: NVIDIA has committed to buy back $6.3 billion in capacity through 2032 if CoreWeave can't fill its data centers. Most cloud providers assume full inventory risk on multi-billion dollar GPU purchases. NVIDIA backstopped its own customer. Not everyone buys it. "There's a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right," says Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities. NVIDIA did not respond to requests for comment. AMD's revenue grew from $22.7 billion in 2023 to $25.8 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $32-34 billion in 2025. A 45% two-year climb, respectable but modest against an AI boom that quintupled NVIDIA's revenue. AMD had been scrambling to break into the AI GPU market. In October, it finally got its break. AMD announced a 6-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, its biggest contract ever. The price of landing a transformational AI customer? AMD issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares at a penny each, potentially giving OpenAI 10% of AMD's equity just to become a supplier. The warrants vest in tranches as OpenAI deploys gigawatts and as AMD's stock hits targets escalating to $600 per share. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri calculated the stake could reach $100 billion if OpenAI holds through completion, though he expects OpenAI will likely sell shares along the way to finance GPU purchases. AMD is essentially financing OpenAI's purchases with its own equity. But AMD isn't just buying in. It's building a genuine alternative. The Helios rack-scale platform matches NVIDIA's Vera Rubin spec-for-spec: 72 GPUs, integrated networking, turnkey deployment, plus 50% more memory at 31TB HBM4. Both systems target mass production in late 2026. AMD projects a $500 billion datacenter AI accelerator TAM by 2028, a conservative estimate given $400 billion in big tech AI capex this year alone. AMD has competitive technology and a massive market opportunity. What it lacks is time and ecosystem lock-in. NVIDIA buys into customers; AMD dilutes to get them. That asymmetry shows NVIDIA's chokehold on the market. Broadcom is playing a different game and winning. Revenue jumped from $35.8 billion in 2023 to $51.6 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $60 billion in 2025. That's a 67% surge as hyperscalers embraced custom ASICs for high-volume inference. On October 13, the company secured 10 gigawatts of custom OpenAI-designed accelerators starting late 2026. It already has design wins generating billions in revenue across Google, Meta, and other hyperscalers. These are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips built for one job—high-volume inference. They're dramatically cheaper and more power-efficient than GPUs for repetitive tasks like answering ChatGPT queries. This is real business taking real market share. The tradeoff? ASICs are appliances, not platforms. A Broadcom chip designed for OpenAI can't run Meta's models. It can't adapt when workloads evolve. However, this matters less than NVIDIA hopes. For mature, stable inference at massive scale, ASICs win on economics. Broadcom isn't a curiosity. It's a genuine competitive threat to NVIDIA's inference dominance. But none of that matters if the grid does not come through; the bottleneck is electricity, not silicon. AI datacenters currently consume approximately 6–8 gigawatts globally. A single gigawatt of electricity—roughly the output of one nuclear reactor running continuously—can power a large AI datacenter. The September OpenAI/NVIDIA deal requires 10 gigawatts. The math is straightforward. At a modern power usage effectiveness (PUE) of ~1.3, a 10-gigawatt facility delivers roughly 7.5 GW of usable compute power. With ~80% dedicated to GPUs—the standard for next-generation AI datacenters—nearly 6 GW goes to accelerators. At ~1 kilowatt per Blackwell-class GPU, this translates to ~6 million chips across ~83,000 racks. OpenAI builds the datacenter buildings, cooling systems, and networking infrastructure—but it does not generate the power. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. For grid operators, the surge is unprecedented. “I have not seen this degree of change in a forecast in my career, and no one has seen these nationwide growth levels since the 1980s,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. The U.S. grid adds roughly ~10–15 gigawatts of new capacity per year. Meeting the ~44–51 GW requirement by 2026 means building 3–5× faster—just for AI datacenters. High-voltage transmission lines take 3–5 years to build, even before community battles and permitting delays. California’s grid operator says datacenter upgrades won’t finish until late 2027. In Northern Virginia, two-thirds of Loudoun County substations face delays through 2026. Small modular reactors won’t arrive until the 2030s. Natural-gas plants are faster but face infrastructure constraints. The deals promise power years before the grid can supply it. Even if the power arrives on schedule, demand itself could evaporate. A structural shift toward cheaper, distributed, and more efficient AI could erode the very economics this boom depends on. If inference improves on lower-cost infrastructure, and if specialized architectures—from domain-specific ASICs to emerging analog accelerators—deliver order-of-magnitude efficiency gains for targeted workloads, the rationale for premium datacenter GPU infrastructure weakens. The $180 billion in deals assumes AI remains proprietary, centralized, and compute-intensive. History rarely cooperates. Technology cycles bend toward efficiency, commoditization, and distribution. Regulators compound the uncertainty. NVIDIA’s model binds capital, supply, and demand into a single reinforcing loop — a structure increasingly under scrutiny in cloud-AI partnerships. In January 2024, the FTC opened a formal Section 6(b) inquiry into AI investment and cloud-compute arrangements, compelling major firms to disclose terms around preferential access, exclusivity, and required cloud-spend. A follow-on FTC report in early 2025 highlighted concerns that equity-linked compute access and tied-spend agreements can reinforce incumbency and limit competition. If regulators conclude these arrangements distort market access, NVIDIA’s flywheel could meet friction. Jensen Huang has built the most elegant flywheel in modern capitalism. But flywheels spin both ways. The loops that accelerated gains can amplify pain when the cycle turns. For investors and strategists, the implications are clear: NVIDIA has built structural advantages that extend far beyond chip performance. Its capital deployment strategy creates switching costs and ecosystem lock-in that competitors can't easily replicate. But the same feedback loops that drive exponential growth in boom times can accelerate downturns. The questions aren't whether NVIDIA dominates today—it does—but whether power infrastructure can support the buildout, whether demand justifies the scale, and whether regulators will allow the flywheel to continue spinning unchecked. The answers will determine whether this is the decade's most prescient capital allocation or its most spectacular miscalculation.

AMD's revenue grew from $22.7 billion in 2023 to $25.8 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $32-34 billion in 2025. A 45% two-year climb, respectable but modest against an AI boom that quintupled NVIDIA's revenue. AMD had been scrambling to break into the AI GPU market. In October, it finally got its break. AMD announced a 6-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, its biggest contract ever. The price of landing a transformational AI customer? AMD issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares at a penny each, potentially giving OpenAI 10% of AMD's equity just to become a supplier. The warrants vest in tranches as OpenAI deploys gigawatts and as AMD's stock hits targets escalating to $600 per share. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri calculated the stake could reach $100 billion if OpenAI holds through completion, though he expects OpenAI will likely sell shares along the way to finance GPU purchases. AMD is essentially financing OpenAI's purchases with its own equity. But AMD isn't just buying in. It's building a genuine alternative. The Helios rack-scale platform matches NVIDIA's Vera Rubin spec-for-spec: 72 GPUs, integrated networking, turnkey deployment, plus 50% more memory at 31TB HBM4. Both systems target mass production in late 2026. AMD projects a $500 billion datacenter AI accelerator TAM by 2028, a conservative estimate given $400 billion in big tech AI capex this year alone. AMD has competitive technology and a massive market opportunity. What it lacks is time and ecosystem lock-in. NVIDIA buys into customers; AMD dilutes to get them. That asymmetry shows NVIDIA's chokehold on the market. Broadcom is playing a different game and winning. Revenue jumped from $35.8 billion in 2023 to $51.6 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $60 billion in 2025. That's a 67% surge as hyperscalers embraced custom ASICs for high-volume inference. On October 13, the company secured 10 gigawatts of custom OpenAI-designed accelerators starting late 2026. It already has design wins generating billions in revenue across Google, Meta, and other hyperscalers. These are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips built for one job—high-volume inference. They're dramatically cheaper and more power-efficient than GPUs for repetitive tasks like answering ChatGPT queries. This is real business taking real market share. The tradeoff? ASICs are appliances, not platforms. A Broadcom chip designed for OpenAI can't run Meta's models. It can't adapt when workloads evolve. However, this matters less than NVIDIA hopes. For mature, stable inference at massive scale, ASICs win on economics. Broadcom isn't a curiosity. It's a genuine competitive threat to NVIDIA's inference dominance. But none of that matters if the grid does not come through; the bottleneck is electricity, not silicon. AI datacenters currently consume approximately 6–8 gigawatts globally. A single gigawatt of electricity—roughly the output of one nuclear reactor running continuously—can power a large AI datacenter. The September OpenAI/NVIDIA deal requires 10 gigawatts. The math is straightforward. At a modern power usage effectiveness (PUE) of ~1.3, a 10-gigawatt facility delivers roughly 7.5 GW of usable compute power. With ~80% dedicated to GPUs—the standard for next-generation AI datacenters—nearly 6 GW goes to accelerators. At ~1 kilowatt per Blackwell-class GPU, this translates to ~6 million chips across ~83,000 racks. OpenAI builds the datacenter buildings, cooling systems, and networking infrastructure—but it does not generate the power. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. For grid operators, the surge is unprecedented. “I have not seen this degree of change in a forecast in my career, and no one has seen these nationwide growth levels since the 1980s,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. The U.S. grid adds roughly ~10–15 gigawatts of new capacity per year. Meeting the ~44–51 GW requirement by 2026 means building 3–5× faster—just for AI datacenters. High-voltage transmission lines take 3–5 years to build, even before community battles and permitting delays. California’s grid operator says datacenter upgrades won’t finish until late 2027. In Northern Virginia, two-thirds of Loudoun County substations face delays through 2026. Small modular reactors won’t arrive until the 2030s. Natural-gas plants are faster but face infrastructure constraints. The deals promise power years before the grid can supply it. Even if the power arrives on schedule, demand itself could evaporate. A structural shift toward cheaper, distributed, and more efficient AI could erode the very economics this boom depends on. If inference improves on lower-cost infrastructure, and if specialized architectures—from domain-specific ASICs to emerging analog accelerators—deliver order-of-magnitude efficiency gains for targeted workloads, the rationale for premium datacenter GPU infrastructure weakens. The $180 billion in deals assumes AI remains proprietary, centralized, and compute-intensive. History rarely cooperates. Technology cycles bend toward efficiency, commoditization, and distribution. Regulators compound the uncertainty. NVIDIA’s model binds capital, supply, and demand into a single reinforcing loop — a structure increasingly under scrutiny in cloud-AI partnerships. In January 2024, the FTC opened a formal Section 6(b) inquiry into AI investment and cloud-compute arrangements, compelling major firms to disclose terms around preferential access, exclusivity, and required cloud-spend. A follow-on FTC report in early 2025 highlighted concerns that equity-linked compute access and tied-spend agreements can reinforce incumbency and limit competition. If regulators conclude these arrangements distort market access, NVIDIA’s flywheel could meet friction. Jensen Huang has built the most elegant flywheel in modern capitalism. But flywheels spin both ways. The loops that accelerated gains can amplify pain when the cycle turns. For investors and strategists, the implications are clear: NVIDIA has built structural advantages that extend far beyond chip performance. Its capital deployment strategy creates switching costs and ecosystem lock-in that competitors can't easily replicate. But the same feedback loops that drive exponential growth in boom times can accelerate downturns. The questions aren't whether NVIDIA dominates today—it does—but whether power infrastructure can support the buildout, whether demand justifies the scale, and whether regulators will allow the flywheel to continue spinning unchecked. The answers will determine whether this is the decade's most prescient capital allocation or its most spectacular miscalculation.

Title: Meta Stock Up 8%. Why Zuckerberg’s Innovation Drought May Sink $META

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Meta's stock fell after Q3 earnings as investors questioned its AI spending without clear revenue, a contrast to peers who saw gains from their AI investments.Concerns are mounting over Meta's use of private debt for AI data centers, with some comparing it to subprime mortgage securitization.Despite skepticism, many Wall Street analysts maintain highly optimistic price targets for Meta's stock. Meta Platforms stock is up 8% this year – lagging Nasdaq’s 22% rise. This follows a disappointing third quarter earnings report that set Meta apart from its peers – Amazon, Google and Microsoft – in the derby to spend billions on AI data centers. Unlike rivals, Meta has yet to build measurable revenue from its AI investment. Does the market’s reaction to Meta’s latest earnings report make the stock a bargain? Here are three reasons to avoid Meta stock: Meta views its AI spending as vital. The company said more spending is crucial for the company’s pursuit of AI that vastly outperforms human capabilities – dubbed superintelligence, Zuckerberg told the Wall Street Journal. Meta will use any extra computing resources from that investment to speed up the company’s core business. “That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities,” Zuckerberg said. “If it takes longer, then we’ll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business. In a worse case scenario, “we would just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build,” he added. Wall Street seems to share the company’s optimism – the consensus price target implies Meta’s stock has 30% upside. Four technology giants – Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon – all raised forecasts for their 2025 AI capital spending to a total of $380 billion, according to CNBC. All of the companies – with the exception of Meta and Microsoft – received a round of applause from investors. Here are why the winners enjoyed a rise in their stock prices following their latest earnings last week: Amazon stock rose after beating on revenue and earnings and announcing a $7 billion boost to its capital expenditure budget for the year. AWS revenue grew 20% – topping analyst expectations; total sales rose 13% beating analysts’ consensus by about $2.4 billion while earnings per share of $1.95 topped estimates by 38 cents, noted CNBC. Amazon will spend $125 billion on AI capex – a figure expected to rise in 2026. “We’ll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI,” Amazon CFO finance Brian Olsavsky said on the earnings call. “We believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term,” he added. Alphabet, Google’s parent, beat earnings expectations and boosted its capex forecast. In its Q3 report, Alphabet hit a record -- over $100 billion in revenue – enjoying growth in both its core advertising business and Google Cloud – with help from AI demand. Alphabet raised its capex forecast 15% to $92 billion at the midpoint of a range, reported CNBC. Microsoft lost ground among investors while exceeding estimates and increasing its capex growth view above analysts’ expectations. The company’s fiscal Q1 revenue and earnings beat consensus – reaching $77.6 billion abetted by a 40% rise in Azure revenue – and EPS of $4.13. Yet Azure demand exceeded capacity – limiting growth. This may explain why Microsoft forecast a 45% increase – to a minimum of $94 billion in capex for fiscal 2026 after previously saying growth would slow, wrote CNBC. Despite beating expectations and raising guidance, Meta’s stock was hit harder – falling 13% since reporting on October 30 – due to an increase in capex without a clear path to new revenue from the investment. This drop subtracted more than $25 billion from Zuckerberg’s net worth, noted Forbes. Revenue rose 26% in the third quarter to $51.24 billion – $1.8 billion above estimates; adjusted EPS of $7.25 was 56 cents higher than consensus; and Meta’s Q4 revenue guidance of $57 billion – the midpoint of a range – exceeded the StreetAccount estimate, according to Zacks. Meta’s capex forecast of $71 billion -- $2 billion more than previously forecast – spooked investors due to a lack of clear revenue upside. “Meta doesn’t have a cloud service and lacks a clear revenue story that’s tied to its AI investments,” reported CNBC. When investors asked Zuckerberg about how Meta would generate revenue from its investment, his reply was vague. “The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the investor call. While Meta said AI improves targeting in the company’s core digital ads business, one analyst did not find this argument compelling. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to hold -- citing an “unknown revenue opportunity,”according to CNBC. Moreover, Oppenheimer sees Meta’s pursuit of superintelligence as potentially following the same path as the company’s metaverse – which has not paid off. How so? In 2021 and 2022, Meta invested heavily in what he touted as spending to create the future of computing. After burning billions “of dollars a quarter on its investments in augmented reality,” wrote CNBC, Meta’s Reality Labs unit lost $4.4 billion in the latest quarter on $470 million in revenue. Another analyst similarly lacks confidence in Meta’s AI bets. “The total dollar spend is just kind of what hangs us up a little bit,” Zacks Investment Management analyst Brian Mulberry told the Journal. “They have to start doing a better job of showing us when that comes back to the balance sheet.” “The return on invested capital is definitely a huge metric for us and the fact that they are being a little bit cagey and not quite upfront with what exactly is going on doesn’t help soothe those fears,” Mulberry added. Meta is not slowing its investment in data centers. The company plans to spend “$600 billion on data centers and other infrastructure in the U.S. through 2028,” Zuckerberg said at a recent White House dinner, according to the Journal. Questions about Meta’s ability to earn a return on its superintelligence bet come in the context of a simple problem: With the exception of the company’s advertising model, Zuckerberg has very little success as an innovator. He is better at execution, strategic acquisitions, and disciplined monetization. For instance, he adapted the social networking concept developed by others, created News Feed and targeted advertising at scale, and most successfully identified and acquired Instagram before it became a threat – transforming a $1 billion gamble into $63 billion in estimated 2025 annual revenue, noted eMarketer. Zuckerberg is struggling to communicate how Meta’s AI bet will evolve into a revenue generating product. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity,” he told investors in the earnings call. This response contrasts sharply with OpenAI which is bringing in $20 billion in annual revenue from ChatGPT – while losing money. Unlike Meta, “there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions,” noted TechCrunch. To be fair, Meta is working on promising experiments. These include the Meta AI assistant which has more than a billion active users with help from three billion active Facebook and Instagram users. Yet Meta AI falls short of ChatGPT’s capabilities. Meta also offers Vibes video generator – which did boost the company’s daily active users but lacks significant scale, noted TechCrunch. Finally, Meta is working on the just-launched Vanguard smart glasses – which “feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of” large language models, reported TechCrunch. There is also concern about Meta borrowing money to pay for its AI capital expenditures. Last month, the company – which had $28.8 billion in debt at the end of September – announced a $27 billion private-debt deal to “finance the construction of a massive new Louisiana data center, called Hyperion,” reported the Journal. Meta – which partnered with private-credit firm Blue Owl Capital – owns a 20% stake in this project. This deal is ringing alarm bells for investors who remember subprime real estate deals – the collapse of which contributed mightily to the 2008 financial crisis. To be fair, in Q3 Meta had $12.3 billion in unlevered free cash flow from which it could make the lease payments. A typical interest rate for a data center lease is 10%, according to ION Analytics. For Meta, such a lease payment would amount to $1.2 billion annually. Private-equity firms such as Blue Owl put up or raise the money to build a data center, which a tech company will repay through rent. Data-center leases from “Meta can then be repackaged into a financial instrument that people can buy and sell—a bond, in essence,” investor and a financial consultant Paul Kedrosky told the Atlantic. Data center leases – which represent an $800 billion market for private equity firms through 2028 – can be combined into a security and sorted into tranches based on their risk of default, noted the Atlantic, as were subprime mortgages in the years before the financial crisis. While data centers are not houses, the former have different sources of risk. Data centers depreciate in value rapidly. The chips inside them become obsolete within a year or two as Nvidia and rivals release more powerful models. Meanwhile, new generations of AI chatbots are not improving as significantly as previous generations did. This failure to advance suggests spending more on superintelligence is becoming “more tenuous by the day,” added the Atlantic. Nevertheless, investors are optimistic about Meta stock. Some 42 Wall Street analysts set an average price target of $847 – implying more than 30% upside from the recent price, reported TipRanks.

Title: Institutional Bitcoin Demand Cools as Bull Market Roars Elsewhere | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because while Wall Street partys on AI-fueled gains, Bitcoin’s biggest backers are quietly stepping back. Fresh data shows BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF inflows have plunged, hinting that institutional enthusiasm may be cooling just as the bull market heats up. The sharp decline in Bitcoin ETF inflow, reported in a recent US Crypto News publication, is raising eyebrows across the crypto market, even as US equities continue their AI-fueled surge. New data from Glassnode shows that institutional demand for Bitcoin has slowed dramatically, contrasting with the growing euphoria in traditional markets led by technology and infrastructure plays. According to Glassnode, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has seen less than 600 BTC in net weekly inflows over the past three weeks. This represents a significant decline from the 10,000 BTC-plus inflows that have historically preceded major rallies in this cycle. “Over the past three weeks, BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF has seen less than 0.6k BTC in weekly net inflows. This represents a sharp decline from the > 10,000 BTC net inflow per week that preceded each major rally this cycle, signaling a notable slowdown in institutional demand,” wrote analysts at Glassnode. The slowdown marks one of the weakest periods of institutional accumulation since the ETF’s launch. The figures suggest that large investors may be taking a breather after months of heavy accumulation. Bitcoin’s price has struggled to maintain momentum, but has slipped below $110,000, trading at $107,868 as of this writing. ETF flows are now considered a leading indicator of sentiment among institutional investors. Despite the soft inflow data, on-chain analysts spotted movement beneath the surface. Whale Insider reported that BlackRock transferred 1,198 BTC, worth approximately $129 million, to Coinbase, suggesting ongoing portfolio realignment or custody adjustments. JUST IN: BlackRock deposits 1,198 $BTC ($129.09 million) and 15,121 $ETH ($56.1 million) to Coinbase within the last hour. pic.twitter.com/2J8ah3MrCw Such movements do not necessarily indicate selling. However, they highlight how major asset managers are actively managing exposure amid volatile macro conditions. ETF providers often rebalance or consolidate holdings across custodians as liquidity and demand fluctuate. While Bitcoin demand cools, traditional markets are powering higher. Evercore ISI maintains a bullish outlook on US equities, projecting the S&P 500 to reach 7,750 by 2026. The firm reportedly cites strong leadership from AI-driven sectors like tech, communications, and consumer discretionary. Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel said the current bull market remains intact, although he warned of near-term volatility tied to shifts in Fed policy and tariffs. EVERCORE: U.S. BULL MARKET STILL STRONG, BUY STOCKSEvercore ISI advised buying U.S. stocks, saying the S&P 500 could hit 7,750 by end-2026 as key signs of a market top are missing. Analyst Julian Emanuel said gains are being led by AI-driven sectors like tech, communication… With the VIX near year-to-date lows, Emanuel recommended using SPY strangles as hedges in a “still-healthy” uptrend. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed this optimism, calling it a market that’s “forgotten how to fall.” He noted that the -3x S&P ETF has reverse-split five times, a sign of how punishing this cycle has been for bears. NEW: Bears Face Extinction in a Market That's Forgotten How to Fall.. The -3x SPX ETF has reverse split 5 times, a crazy data point showing just how brutal this mkt has been for bears. While they'll get their moment (pullbacks are part of life) we also show that long term it pays… pic.twitter.com/58BwtcWTGg The diverging trends highlight a key tension in global markets. AI and equity exuberance are absorbing liquidity, while Bitcoin’s institutional narrative temporarily cools. As macro liquidity tightens and investor enthusiasm tilts toward AI infrastructure, Bitcoin’s next leg may depend more on when big money returns to the digital frontier than on policy signals.

Title: Earnings, Deals and Trade, Set the Tone for the Week

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Trade talk between US and China helped calm Markets - Tech and Health Care deals over weekend - Earning season continues The trade truce that was established last week between the US and China is having a positive effect on the markets in today’s premarket trading. We saw the Asian markets with a positive reaction overnight (although Japan was closed for a Holiday) and the S&P500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures Contracts are all positive in premarket trade today. The major Indices are hoping to build on the momentum of last week and last month. In the month of October, we saw the S&P 500 up approximately 2.5% and the Nasdaq up just under 5%. In what is often a tough month we had an uneven but positive reaction the positive news that we received from Amazon.com on Friday certainly helped us finish on a strong note. As mentioned, we have positive signs in premarket trade, but we also have some deal news that could also help drive markets higher. We had news that Microsoft Corporation announced that they have entered into a contract with IREN Limited, for $9.7 Billion that will allow Microsoft Corporation to have access to NVIDIA Corporation Chips. The five-year contract will include a 20% prepayment and is clearly being viewed positively by the Market. In premarket trade we have both stocks higher, with IREN Limited up by over 20%. We also have a deal in Health Care area, with Kimberly Clark Corporation purchasing Kenvue Corporation which is the parent company of Tylenol. The cash and stock transaction will value the Kenvue franchise at $48.7 Billion. This is a weekend with lots of news coming into Monday, but there are still some other things to keep our eyes on that will move markets and some things we will talk about for the rest of the week. The first thing is to not forget that we are still in the height of earnings season and with that there are some favorites of Retail Traders reporting this week. That starts today with Palantir Technologies. We see the options market is pricing in an expected move of about 2% for the move after earnings on a stock that has doubled this year. We also have Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday, and all will be waiting to hear more about their recent deals, particularly more about the details on the Oracle Corporation deal. The other major earnings on Monday and Tuesday include Uber Technologies, Shopify Incorporated and Pfizer incorporated The government shutdown continues and besides the human toil and effect of this, we are also seeing companies starting to suffer because of this with the Airlines front and center, as we are starting to see the delay times at airports continue to stack up and companies waiting on approvals for things from the government having to wait while this is settled. We also and news from OPEC+ group this weekend as they announced that they would halt planned production increases at the beginning of 2026. The price of Crude Oil is largely unchanged in premarket trade. We do have some numbers this week, the non-delayed numbers include ISM Services and Consumer Sentiment. Plenty of opportunities this week, as always, stick to your trading plan and long-term goals

Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be involved in crypto. 2️⃣ Massive inflows into products like Bitwise’s Solana ETF and moves by giants like JP Morgan and BlackRock prove the shift is already underway. 3️⃣ The best altcoins to buy now include $HYPER, $PEPENODE, and $BAN – all poised to ride the next big wave. Crypto is hosting the wildest party in town, there is no doubt about it. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently took to X to claim that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be doing something in crypto. ‘Software is eating the world. Crypto is going to eat capital markets’ – Hunter Horsley Almost every major bank, from Bank of America and BlackRock to Goldman Sachs and HSBC, is knee-deep in one or more crypto-related endeavors, whether that’s crypto trading and custody, crypto ETPs, crypto-enabled payments, or tokenization. Is Horsley’s claim a bold one? Sure. Especially considering that DeFi currently represents less than half a percent of traditional finance’s scope. That said, it’s worth noting that these crypto-related investment products are still relatively new, and it’s only fair to give them time to mature rather than immediately comparing them to TradFi. If anything, the massive interest in these new products – ETFs being a great example – shows that the sky is the limit for crypto. That’s a clear sign the market is hungry for new-age investment products that give it exposure to high-quality cryptos. What’s more, a recent Bloomberg report revealed that JP Morgan is all set to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as loan collateral. This would offer billion-dollar investment parties more flexible financing options, allowing them to retain their crypto holdings and avoid triggering taxable events. And then there’s BlackRock, one of the biggest asset-management companies in the world, which now boasts over $87B in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $10B in Ether ETFs – proving that crypto is indeed the next big investment opportunity. Don’t want to miss the crypto gold rush? Ready to ride Wall Street’s smarts? Below are three top altcoins to buy right now. One of the best crypto presales of 2025, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has already raised an eye-popping $25.6M+ from early investors. And it’s worth the hype. That’s because $HYPER plans to bring Solana-like speeds, low costs, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain, which has so far been technologically sidelined compared to Ethereum and Solana. It’ll also enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. So, get ready to access DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, and gaming on Bitcoin, all thanks to Bitcoin Hyper. Furthermore, a decentralized canonical bridge will facilitate seamless interaction between Bitcoin’s Layer-1 and Hyper’s Layer-2 networks. Simply put, it’ll convert your original Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer 2-compatible tokens. Here’s the kicker: if you want to join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution, now’s the best time to get in. The project is currently in presale, meaning right now you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.013215 each – and stake it for 46% APY. Check out our guide to buying $HYPER to find out how. And holding onto your tokens until 2026 could earn you a handsome 1,400% ROI, with the token projected to potentially reach $0.20 according to our $HYPER price prediction. To fully understand PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)’s ground-breaking potential to become the next crypto to explode, consider how it aims to revolutionize the crypto mining segment. Right now, traditional crypto mining is not only super expensive – with high GPU, electricity, and maintenance costs – but also highly technical, requiring detailed knowledge to set up and operate. First, PEPENODE is extremely affordable, as your only starting cost is the price of your first $PEPENODE token, which, during its current presale, is just $0.0011317 per token. Second, mining on PEPENODE is set to be simple yet engaging. The only challenge lies in experimenting with different combinations of mining nodes, as each will have unique characteristics and compatibilities. Despite being virtual, the mining setup will feel just like the real thing. The dashboard will include familiar elements such as hashrate and other key performance metrics. Interested? Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $PEPENODE. And according to our $PEPENODE price prediction, if you catch the trend early and get in now, you could potentially see a 542% ROI by the end of 2026. Comedian ($BAN) launched in October last year and rode the Q4 boom to shoot up over 3,000% in less than a month. It’s a viral meme coin inspired by the controversial art piece by Maurizio Cattelan, which features nothing more than a banana taped to a wall. This artwork sparked an ongoing debate about modern art vs. contemporary art and whether modern art is borderline stupid, fueling massive investor interest in the $BAN token. Nearly 12 months later, the token now appears ready for another major rally. It’s currently finding support on a key upward-sloping trendline – the same one that triggered a 1,000% rally back in March this year. However, with a strong resistance line overhead, its upside potential will depend on whether it can successfully break past that resistance. That said, even from current levels up to that resistance line, there’s at least a 50% gain on offer. But if $BAN manages to break beyond that line – which is highly likely given that it has tested it four times already (and as we know, the more times a resistance is tested, the weaker it gets) – then we could see another 2024-style rally. Join the meme coin mania – buy $BAN on MEXC today. Disclaimer: Kindly do thorough first-hand research before investing, as crypto is highly volatile. This article is not financial advice.

Sign up now Market musings In my years covering markets, I can't recall a time when there's been more polarizing views on the future of stocks. Sure, there's always chatter when indexes are near record highs about what could send it all crashing down. But it feels different now. The arguments are more multi-faceted, and go beyond the traditional "market-wide valuations are too high" takes. Whether it's concerns over AI capex spending, or cries of unprecedented mega-cap tech weightings in indexes, it seems like the bear case has more meat on the bone right now. On the bullish side of the ledger, investors are happy to lean into the narrative that AI spending will eventually lead to transformational profit growth, pushing stocks even higher. They also see Fed rate cuts as rocket fuel for the entire market, since they've historically served as such, especially for economically sensitive sectors. As a card-carrying (but possibly converted) member of the "not a bubble" camp, the huge sell-off in Meta last week got my attention. It showed that investors are ready to start questioning huge AI spending, even if the company's more diversified tech peers didn't absorb the same share-price hit. But we see both sides of the coin here at First Trade, and have compiled investing recommendations specifically for bulls and bears. For bulls If you're a member of this faction, it's likely you see Fed rate cuts as a godsend, because they'll stimulate economic activity. You also probably feel pretty good about inflation, despite it staying persistently above the Fed's target. Well, you're in luck. Bank of America recently recommended the following sector ETFs that are due for a catch-up if the economy booms in the first quarter of 2026: If you're looking to stick with the AI wave, UBS says these three under-the-radar names are poised for outperformance: For bears If you're fearful of an AI-driven meltdown, fret not, BofA has you covered from this angle as well. The firm says these are the two best places to invest for upside protected from US tech exposure: One additional way to continue outperforming during a tech-driven downturn is through the purchase of momentum stocks. The most popular fund for this is iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM). Jason Browne, the founder of Alexis Investment Partners, told BI this past week that the strategy is ideal for when one area of the market — like the tech sector — enters a lengthy rough patch. With US economic data on ice for the foreseeable future, uncertainty reigns supreme in the market. But now you're armed with some trades to deploy, regardless of where you line up. "If you come at the king, you best not miss." — Omar Little from "The Wire" Let's just say I learned this the hard way, and am currently eating crow. Last week, ahead of Amazon's earnings, First Trade wrote about the drastic underperformance of the company's stock over the past five years, relative to the Mag 7 and S&P 500. Well, Andy Jassy must've used it as bulletin-board material, because Amazon promptly crushed earnings and sent its stock spiking 10% (pictured above). The main reason was the stellar performance of AWS, which is also one of the main areas of AI investment. In one fell swoop, Amazon dispatched lingering worries about a core business and assuaged concerns over huge AI spending. The stock still has a long way to go to catch up with peers, but last week was a massive step in the right direction. This chart from Bank of America supports one of the recommendations from the Market Musings section above: buy Chinese stocks if you're afraid of a US tech sell-off. The light blue line — which plots Chinese stocks versus government bonds — is close to a multi-decade low, suggesting immense catch-up potential. Compare that to the dark blue line, which offers the same ratio for US stocks versus sovereign bonds. It's at multi-decade highs, implying limited relative upside. In this section, a weekly feature on Mondays, we manage a hypothetical portfolio. Current stocks: Amazon, JPMorgan, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla Now that's more like it! The First Trade index absolutely crushed it over the last week, and a big part of that was the new addition of Nvidia. Not to mention Amazon spiking 10% on Friday after blockbuster earnings. Those two stocks largely carried our basket of stocks to market-beating performance. What we have here is a perfect example of the electric upside offered by the tech stalwarts that make up the Magnificent 7. These stocks are largely responsible for the stock market's ongoing record-breaking rally, given their massive weightings, and the First Trade index got the same boost as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. When all was said and done, the First Trade index ended the week 6% higher, handily beating the S&P 500's 1% return. Also, after trailing the S&P 500 last week, First Trade is now outperforming it by more than double since this project started. Can we keep the roll going and do even better this week?

Title: Standard Chartered CEO: All Global Transactions Will Move to Blockchain

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bill Winters made a forecast at Hong Kong FinTech Week, while praising the city’s digital asset regulatory leadership. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated on Nov. 3 that he believes all global transactions will eventually settle on blockchains and all money will be digital. Winters made the comments during a panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week. Winters described the anticipated transition as a fundamental restructuring of the financial system, according to CNBC. However, he acknowledged that the industry does not know exactly how this transformation will occur and emphasized the need for continued experimentation. HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery joined Winters on the same panel and expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s fintech future. Winters praised Hong Kong’s leadership in digital asset regulation and its willingness to support blockchain experimentation. Other financial leaders, including the CEOs of BlackRock and Robinhood, have recently made similar predictions about the tokenization of traditional assets. Standard Chartered announced a joint venture with Animoca Brands and HKT in February 2025 to pursue a license for issuing an HKD-backed stablecoin. The partnership brings together the bank’s financial infrastructure, Animoca Brands’ Web3 expertise, and HKT’s mobile wallet capabilities. Standard Chartered participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s stablecoin issuer sandbox, which launched in July 2024. Multiple institutions are competing to build payment settlement networks through stablecoin initiatives, according to a recent stablecoin ‘infrastructure war’ report. Beyond stablecoins, Standard Chartered launched an integrated spot trading service for Bitcoin BTC $103 282 24h volatility: 4.2% Market cap: $2.06 T Vol. 24h: $74.76 B and Ether ETH $3 395 24h volatility: 6.7% Market cap: $409.42 B Vol. 24h: $37.45 B in July 2025 for institutional clients via its UK branch. The service offers Bitcoin (XBT/USD) and Ether (XET/USD) trading pairs. The bank has expanded its digital asset offerings through partnerships, including StanChart’s institutional crypto custody services with OKX in Europe. Hong Kong regulators have established multiple sandbox programs and regulatory frameworks to position the city as a global digital asset hub. The government has supported blockchain innovation through licensing regimes and pilot programs for financial institutions. The Hong Kong Blockchain Week started Nov. 3 and will last until Nov. 7.

Title: Your Town’s Local History Books Have a Very Secret and Powerful New Buyer

This piece has been updated with information that came to light after the article went to press. Even if you’ve never heard of Arcadia Publishing, you’ve undoubtedly come upon their books at some point—displayed in a gift shop kiosk, stocked in an airport bookstore or neighborhood library, or even at a CVS. The branding remains distinct across its nearly 17,000-title catalog: a small hardbound or paperback book that catches your eye via large sepia images and titles like Theatres of San Francisco and Central Kentucky Postcards, inscribed in the style of an old-school street sign. No matter where you go across America—the mountains of Wyoming, a small town in Indiana, or the swamps of Florida—you’ll seemingly find a book from Arcadia about the local history. “They connect with a lot of historians, or locals who have an interest in history, to publish these picture-heavy books,” Alex Brown, a Bay Area librarian and two-time author for the Arcadia imprint History Press, told me. “A lot of Arcadia authors are just regular people: older volunteers at historical societies, or retirees who really like local history.” Brown is a California native who studied Black communities in the North Bay for their master’s degree and got to apply their intimate knowledge to write 2019’s Hidden History of Napa Valley and 2020’s Lost Restaurants of Napa Valley and Their Histories, after a representative from History Press connected with them a few years prior. “My first book focused on the people with marginalized identities—people of color, immigrants, women—who’d lived there.” Brown didn’t hear much from the company after 2020. Then, on July 11, they got an email from out of nowhere: Arcadia Publishing had been “presented with an opportunity to provide content to a major technology company involved in AI development,” according to the message. Brown was given a deadline of one week to decide whether the books they’d written for the imprint could be used “for AI training purposes.” It was an odd request, not only for the hasty deadline, but for the lack of details. The “major technology company” went totally unnamed; Arcadia only offered the guarantee that the artificial intelligence firm was a “trusted partner” as determined by a round of “serious deliberation.” The publishing house also made clear that its contracts allowed the company to farm its books out to A.I. models without the writers’ permission, but added that it “values its relationships with its authors” and wanted to grant them “the opportunity to opt out in this specific instance.” The particular instance, between Brown’s two titles, also wasn’t clarified. The email added that inaction would be considered endorsement; if Brown didn’t respond, they would simply receive a $340 check by the end of the year. But if they wanted “to opt out of the use and receive no payment,” they would have to visit a hyperlinked page and follow the instructions. Brown already had a sour A.I. experience: Their two books with History Press had also been included within Library Genesis, the mass set of pirated texts that companies like Anthropic and Meta had illicitly downloaded to train their large language models without requisite author compensation. So Brown was not inclined to give up their work to yet another artificial intelligence enterprise, especially one that didn’t reveal itself up front. After contacting an Arcadia representative and speaking with their prior editor, Brown found out that their second book with History Press was “not included in this specific data sale.” So they opted the first book out, turning down the $340 offer.* “Their contracts, at least at the time, were not negotiable. You basically sign it or you don’t,” Brown said. “It’s a very different structure from the Big Five publishers. You don’t get an advance or anything. You just get the royalties.” Those royalties are based on net sales, and they only make for a substantive amount should the books in question get decent sales, something that’s harder for a locally focused outfit like History Press and a broadly niche-interest publisher like Arcadia. In a 2022 blog post, the New Jersey–based nonprofit Mr. Local History claimed that Arcadia offers “one of the lowest royalties paid to authors in the publishing world,” pointing out that “authors get $1 or less for each book sold” and are compensated only twice a year, “whereas many other publishers pay monthly or quarterly.” Such hyperlocal histories are a crucial resource, a way for particular communities to preserve and chronicle their cultures, as well as a means for marketing their regions to tourists and chance visitors. But their audiences are consequentially limited, so Arcadia does not usually approach its authors with hundreds of dollars on offer. In its email to Brown, the publishing house even pointed out that these opportunities for author compensation “could be very limited in the future,” pointing to summertime court verdicts that recognized the A.I. training process as fair use—even with copyright material. Arcadia was offering its authors a favor, while making clear it didn’t have to, and pointing out that this could be their only chance. And the A.I. ventures have only expanded since then. On Oct. 31, another email with similar language was sent out to a group authors who worked with Belt Publishing, an Arcadia imprint that focuses on the Midwest. Belt had not been involved with the first round of the A.I. deal, as its founder and director Anne Trubek had told me in a July email—but as of just last week, “Some Belt titles were included in a 2nd round,” Trubek wrote to me in a follow-up after this piece went live. The deal was reportedly “finalized last week,” Trubek posted on Bluesky. Craig Calcaterra, a baseball writer who published Rethinking Fandom: How to Beat the Sports-Industrial Complex at Its Own Game with Belt in 2022, reprinted the email in his Monday-morning newsletter, which included an offer of $355 and an opt-out deadline of Nov. 7. “I’ve gotten some preliminary information through informal channels that the accelerated time table is being pushed by the tech company,” Calcaretta wrote. “Needless to say I have opted out of this ‘opportunity.’ I also hereby opt out of ever working with Arcadia/Belt Publishing again.” Some authors with Pelican Publishing, another Arcadia imprint, were also offered A.I.-deal money and given a Nov. 7 opt-out deadline. Arcadia is hardly the only book publisher to ink such opaque contracts with the A.I. overlords, despite the spirited objections and lawsuits brought by various authors. University and scholarly presses—which have been confronting the fallout from the Trump administration’s mass grant cancellations, higher printing and shipping costs from tariffs, and industry headwinds—are providing the model. Taylor & Francis, an academic publisher based in the United Kingdom, signed a $10 million deal with Microsoft last year to share a portion of its catalog for A.I. training, in exchange for annual payments from the tech giant through 2027. Authors were reportedly given no notice and their royalties were measly in turn; Bloomberg quoted one anonymous Taylor & Francis author who claimed to earn only $97 for ceding their book to the training maw. (A T&F spokesman told Bloomberg that the payments were “in accordance with the licensing terms and royalty statement periods in their contracts,” while parent company Informa declared in a press release that “the agreement protects intellectual property rights.”) Wiley, an over-200-year-old academic publishing house, has already struck multiple A.I. deals for licensing and product integration, offering up its works to inform the output of Perplexity’s LLM and Amazon Web Services’ chatbot. For the publishers, the arrangements were lucrative. For the authors, the payouts were much less so. In July, Johns Hopkins University Press gave the authors of its 3,000-title catalog an Aug. 31 deadline to opt out of having their works become A.I. training fodder in a new tech partnership. If they opted in, they would receive a little under $100 per work. Like Arcadia, Hopkins Press did not disclose the A.I. company involved or the money it was hoping to earn. It did press the urgency of signing now while writers still had some agency, and reminded them who here really has the power. “In your contract, you provide us with the rights to go ahead with this kind of licensing,” Barbara Kline Pope, executive director of Hopkins Press, wrote to her writers. “However, we would like you to have the ability to opt out if you so choose.” The press was not suffering businesswise, she clarified, but it was “exploring how our financial model may need to evolve.” One author who went for the opt-out contract addendum with Johns Hopkins Press shared the resultant language with Inside Higher Ed; it warned that “sales and reach” of their work might suffer due to the A.I.opt-out. Beyond academia, HarperCollins became the first Big Five commercial publisher to seal an A.I. deal in late 2024 with an unnamed company—allegedly Microsoft, according to anonymous sources. Writers who opt in would earn $2,500 per book for the trouble, which wouldn’t be deducted from their typical royalties, and HarperCollins itself would also pocket another $2,500 per book. (Microsoft has not commented publicly, but HarperCollins has stated that the deal will “allow limited use of select nonfiction backlist titles for training AI models to improve model quality and performance.”) London-based Bloomsbury Publishing announced in August that it was “exploring” licensing agreements for its Academic and Professional arm, reaching out to those writers and offering just 20 percent of the money the publisher receives from the A.I. licensing deal. (The Society of Authors condemned these terms as “not fair and equitable.”) One author who’d contributed a volume to Bloomsbury’s popular 33 1/3 album-tribute series shared some of the company’s emails with me on condition of anonymity. Again, no specific partners or terms were mentioned, and the opt-out process required many steps, including an explicitly written reason for choosing not to participate. (This particular author’s simple, blunt response read, “I’m not interested in licensing my book to Generative AI companies.”) Recently, Bloomsbury’s chief publisher celebrated a concrete A.I. deal for a part of its Academic and Professional catalog—details still TBA—that apparently drove a revenue increase of 20 percent for that division over the first half of the year. As a publicly traded firm, its stock rose when the chief endorsed the possibility of even more A.I. deals on the table. The legal and regulatory landscape has provided little clarity. If anything, the courts have inadvertently revealed more on how authors have historically been exploited. In June, a federal court ruled that the prominent A.I. startup Anthropic had not committed any misdeeds by using copyright works from nonfiction and fiction writers like Andrea Bartz to train its Claude model—but it had violated intellectual property rights by pirating many of those books for training purposes, via unlawful book databases like Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror. To halt further litigation around said piracy, the $183 billion Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to the affected authors and publishers, making for the largest copyright settlement in history—amounting to about $3,000 per pirated work. Meanwhile, Microsoft and its partner OpenAI are facing so many copyright lawsuits from authors that the cases have been consolidated into a single instance of multidistrict class-action litigation. The argument of training as copyright infringement has managed to advance there as of Monday, thanks to output from ChatGPT that appeared to be mighty similar to George R.R. Martin’s fantasy works. In the face of a federal administration that seeks to nix all copyright protections against the A.I. sector, legal recourse remains the only potential remedy for authors. This power imbalance creates a cynical opportunity for the A.I. companies: pay the typically underpaid writers for books they were already stealing or planned to steal. A way of laundering legitimacy and skirting costly courtroom battles for pennies on the dollar. The typical Arcadia volume is chock-full of vintage photographs and tends to be less text-focused; History Press, as with the other imprints Arcadia has scooped up over time, allows authors to actually write more. The covers and branding look a touch different, but the subject matter, and the focus, is distinctly Arcadia. “You have to have a certain number of photos, a nice range of topics, and a bibliography, though they don’t care if that’s in the book or on a website somewhere,” Brown explained. Other than those conditions, Brown was free to frame the project to their liking: “I did not think that I would be able to get one of the Big Five publishers or an academic press to publish a book on marginalized history in Napa County that had nothing to do with wine. History Press was willing to do it.” It does appear that the text-heavier History Press was the focus of Arcadia’s A.I. deal—and it was likely a similar factor with Belt Publishing for the second round. When Brown posted a Bluesky thread in July about the A.I. email, they’d hoped to hear from other Arcadia writers who’d received similar messages, but the ones who did reply and speak with Brown had no awareness of the A.I. deal, or whether their current or future works would be involved. Only one other writer, baseball historian and Kane County Cougars author David Malamut, publicly shared his Arcadia A.I. email on the social network, with its offer of $205. (Malamut did not respond to my interview requests.) Stephanie Hoover, an artist and researcher who’s published three books with History Press, also put out a public ask about the deal on LinkedIn to no avail, even though she’s long been connected with many Arcadia writers. “I pitched my first book, The Killing of John Sharpless, to History Press in 2012, before Arcadia purchased it,” Hoover told me. “They accepted it so fast that I almost thought that they were pulling my leg.” The issues inherent to a quick deal with a niche business were apparent upfront. “They offered no advance. The clause that I really should have taken out was the right of first refusal, which boxed me in,” she explained. Hoover’s last book with History Press, The Kelayres Massacre, was put out just a few months after Arcadia acquired the publisher. So Hoover didn’t have much direct experience with Arcadia until the A.I. email—by which time she’d worked with bigger publishers: “I actually got an advance, and I actually do get some royalties.” The smaller earnings from History Press/Arcadia were what soured Hoover and led her to notify them, in 2016, that she would no longer run book ideas by them: “Most of the time, I’d get these royalty statements like, Nope, nothing this time, nothing this time,” she said. That pushed her to take the A.I. deal for all three of her titles, equating to $1,020, or $340 per book—the same value as Alex Brown’s offer, but more than the compensation offered to David Malamut. “I looked at my husband and said, ‘This will literally be more money than I’ve made on all three books,’ ” Hoover said. “I’m not a fan of A.I. I think it’s a threat to so many industries. But the bottom line was, A.I. is going to cannibalize my books at some point anyway, whether I want it to or not. At least this way I make something.” Still, it’s not as though she considers that price tag to be sufficient. “It took me about six months to research each of the books, and anywhere from three to four months to write them. This is a big chunk of your life, and I did it three times,” she added. “It’s frustrating when you invest that sort of time and labor to make next to nothing. It’s heartbreaking.” Michael Burgess, former director of the New York State Office for the Aging under Gov. Eliot Spitzer, had a unique introduction to Arcadia. His self-published local history, 2021’s Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in New York, was republished by History Press in 2023 and retitled with a focus on the state capital, Albany. After Burgess got the A.I. email, which also offered the $340 royalty, he wrote an optimistic PSA on LinkedIn touting the “unexpected small financial benefit from artificial intelligence,” noting that Arcadia’s offer was “worth the small royalties I get for about 200 book sales.” “I get 7 percent of the sale of a $25 book,” Burgess told me. “I spent all this time writing it. You never get a lot of money.” The time he put into the book required research that, he believes, A.I. cannot do. “I go to the New York State Library, and I’m able to look on microfilm at the papers of Franklin Roosevelt as governor,” Burgess told me. “The A.I. is not going to go and get microfilm, I can tell you that.” He likewise mentioned a 1955 Eleanor Roosevelt radio interview he uncovered—which he could access and contextualize because his father was the correspondent. But for Burgess, it even goes beyond research. “I used ChatGPT and put something in about Eleanor Roosevelt, and it said, Eleanor and her husband Theodore Roosevelt,” he said. “I’m resigned to the fact they’re going to do this. So I’m glad I can help to give facts about this part of the story, rather than them getting it wrong about Eleanor Roosevelt.” When I reached out to Arcadia for comment, the publisher had little info to provide in terms of the partnership and its exact terms, but it did reiterate its commitment to the writers. “Any Arcadia licensing arrangements in this area will reflect our position: Authors will have a choice, and all participating authors will be compensated,” Katie Parry, a publicist and associate publisher at Arcadia, wrote in an email. “We’ll pursue opportunities that align with our position.” A lot is still unclear, but a few things are apparent: A.I. companies are aggressively reaching out to book publishers to strike deals that will allow them to sidestep the litigation that led to the Anthropic settlement and avoid the heftier payouts. Whichever unnamed firm approached Arcadia, it took a particular interest in the wordier History Press, indicating that generative text remains the lodestar. And if the Theodore/Franklin Roosevelt mix-up is representative of other chatbot hallucinations, that perhaps indicates the need not just for these bots to brush up on history and text, but to ramp up the representation of local history in the mix in order to make the LLMs more universal. If that’s the goal, at least Alex Brown’s work will not be involved: On Oct. 7, they signed newly offered addenda to their Arcadia contracts that opts them out of A.I. training offers indefinitely. Yet Arcadia as a whole, much like its fellow publishers, remains open to A.I. business. At least, while they’re still able to get anything out of the trade. Correction, Nov. 3, 2025: This piece originally misstated that Alex Brown had not received any money from Arcadia prior to the A.I. offer. Both Arcadia and Brown have confirmed that the author has received royalties. This piece has also been updated to clarify Arcadia’s royalties process.

Check out our Live Next Crypto to Explode Updates for November 3, 2025! Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto. Quick Picks for Coins with Explosive Potential Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) - Real-Time Layer-2 Solution for Scaling Bitcoin Launch: May, 2025 Join Presale Maxi Doge ($MAXI) - High-Impact Meme Coin Built On Strength, Staking & Conviction Launch: July, 2025 Join Presale PepeNode ($PEPENODE) - A New, Gamified Way to Mine to Earn Meme Coin Rewards Launch: February, 2025 Join Presale Snorter Token ($SNORT) - Lowest-Fee Telegram Trading Bot for Solana and Ethereum Launch: May, 2025 Join Presale Best Wallet Token ($BEST) - Get Easy, Early Access to New Curated Presale Projects Launch: November, 2024 Join Presale If you’re looking for the most recent insights on the next crypto to explode, stay tuned. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest and greatest insider insights for chart sniffers and traders looking for the next coin to explode. November 3, 2025 • 15:00 UTC The Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility exists to pump funds into the banking system when needed. Practically speaking, that means adding liquidity at key points. And in the past week, they’ve quietly added $79B – including a major $50B injection. This means that leading cryptos – including Bitcoin and Best Wallet Token – could be set for a liquidity pump, as investors turn their eyes to riskier assets. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has followed liquidity roughly 80% of the time, climbing as liquidity increases and falling as it decreases. Best Wallet Token and the Best Wallet ecosystem help investors access tokens across the crypto economy, with the wallet, $BEST token, and upcoming Best Card all working together seamlessly. Explore the next cryptos to explode with our guide. November 3, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Michael Saylor forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $150K by the end of 2025, fuelling renewed optimism among Bitcoin holders. He also expects $BTC to reach $1M within the next 4-8 years, a 9X surge from current levels. Saylor’s vision for digital gold doesn’t stop there. He goes on to state that Bitcoin will climb to $20M per coin within the next 20 years. Saylor claims that his forecast is based on the consensus of equity analysts at Strategy, which shows that his forecast isn’t just empty rhetoric but backed by analytical reasoning. While $BTC is now trading near $107K, he states that the falling volatility and new hedging tools will stabilize the coin. While that’s Saylor’s stance on $BTC’s future, Bitcoin proponents like Samson Mow and Arthur Hayes echo similar sentiments, stating that $BTC will indeed reach $1M before the end of this decade. With Bitcoin gaining momentum, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a Layer 2 scalability solution is gaining traction with its $25.6M presale fundraise. Check out the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction here. Aster Token Skyrockets After Binance’s CZ Discloses $2.5M Holding – Is $HYPER the Next Crypto to Explode? November 3, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Aster ($ASTER) surged over 30% on Sunday after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao revealed his $2.5M personal investment in the token. As the native crypto of an emerging decentralized exchange protocol, $ASTER holds large potential. But it remains to be seen whether it can sustain the recent gains with tangible developments that validate the hype. The token’s surge has strengthened speculations that Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might be the next crypto to explode. To begin with, the sensational $HYPER token presale is on its way to $26M. But the real catalyst behind the growing hype – which has already seen whale purchases worth $379K and $274K – is its underlying Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. The project’s goal is to turn the Bitcoin network into a Web3 hub for innovation with speed and programmability. For a clearer picture of where the token is headed, read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction. November 3, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Ethereum’s on-chain dominance grows as apps built on the blockchain now hold $370B in user assets. This comes as no surprise as Ethereum is the undisputed hub for high-value DeFi and dApp activity. Ethereum also acts as a magnet for developers and open-source contributors with its Layer 2 solutions like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. It’s not only renowned for its innovation-centric ecosystem, but as the RWA tokenization leader with its 55% share of the total tokenization asset market, worth $12.2B. That said, $ETH now trades at $3,729, down 10.29% weekly. As the token is already trading above its 200-day EMA ($3,609.7), analysts expect a rally anytime now. With Ethereum gearing up for a potential rally, a presale project built on its network – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is gaining massive traction. It is a gamified mine-to-earn ecosystem that lets users experience mining without an expensive or complicated setup. PEPENODE’s presale has already raised $2M so far. And the project offers a compelling staking APY of 633%. Learn how to buy PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) here. November 3, 2025 • 11:00 UTC Ethereum ($ETH) may be down at the moment, but it now has one of the largest foreign-exchange reserve pools in the world, eclipsing the likes of Singapore and India. That’s because around $165B worth of stablecoins have been issued on Ethereum, according to a Be In Crypto report. This underscores the growing importance of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization. For now, though, there’s no dethroning Bitcoin ($BTC) from the number one spot. This is the reason why many projects continue to build on the Bitcoin blockchain, including Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). With its Layer 2 network, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver fast and low-cost transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its ongoing presale has already raised a whopping $25.6M, potentially making it the next crypto to explode. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper here. November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Founder of Strategy, Saylor, has hinted at another major Bitcoin Purchase, which will make it the company’s 13th consecutive $BTC buying streak. In a post on X, Saylor noted that ‘Orange is the color of November.’ Historically ‘Orange’ hints from Saylor have meant that a Bitcoin buy is in the offing. With Strategy already holding 640,808 BTC, the company’s portfolio has appreciated by over 48% since its inception. That said, the company’s last buy was just last Monday where it accumulated another 390 $BTC. Strategy’s most recent purchase amid the recent market volatility is another example of Saylor’s unshakable faith in Bitcoin and its long-term value. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has waved the truce flag with China by signing a new trade deal with President Xi. With Saylor’s bullish tweet and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, analysts expect $BTC to rally this November. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a Layer-2 scalability project designed to make life easier for $BTC holders, is now perfectly positioned to ride this momentum. Find out what makes Bitcoin Hyper the next crypto to explode. November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitwise’s Hunter Horseley cited on X that every wall street institution will be involved in crypto by next year. His forecast isn’t farfetched as the growing trend in TradFi show that global institutions managing over $30T are actively expanding their exposure to digital assets. Although DeFi only accounts for less than 0.5% of TradFi’s total market scope, its growing influence is evident through tokenization, yield products, and programmable real-world asset structures. BlackRock leads the charge with over $87M in spot Bitcoin ETFs and $10B in Ether ETFs. Meanwhile, major institutions like JPMorgan, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and BNY Mellon are also experimenting with tokenized funds, regulated DeFi, and on-chain settlement models. As the institutional momentum is building, investors are exploring for the next 100X project to position themselves for the market’s next bull run. One standout project gaining massive traction in its presale is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a gamified mine-to-earn ecosystem that fosters a competitive environment and offers attractive meme coin rewards. Learn how to get your hands on Pepenode ($PEPENODE) here.

Title: Global Digital Finance unveils results of study on tokenized money market funds
URL: https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/107787/global-digital-finance-unveils-results-of-study-on-tokenized-money-market-funds
Time Published: 2025-11-03T09:43:00Z
Full Content:
Global Digital Finance (GDF), the leading global digital assets members association, announced the results of a working group reporting on the legal certainty of collateral eligibility and the mobility of Tokenized Money Market Funds (TMMF) in Luxembourg, Ireland, and the UK. 1 03 November 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Ireland and Luxembourg host more than 80% of the MMFs and cross-border funds in Europe and English law governs the Credit Support Annex (CSA).The report concludes:• There is relative legal certainty of TMMFs located in Luxembourg in a digitally native or registered form due to the availability of statutory frameworks to govern such transactions• Longstanding historical legal interaction between Luxembourg and the UK in respect of financial and investment contractual arrangements, including CSAs, also makes this an attractive place to establish a TMMF where the tokens will be posted as collateral under a CSA governed by English law • There is not yet express statutory or judicial authority in Ireland specifically addressing tokenized shares or TMMFs. Legal certainty in respect of ownership and treatment of tokenized shares under Irish law therefore requires an analogy to traditional shares and electronic contracts, rather than being directly established • It is reasonable to conclude that Irish courts would treat digitally native TMMF shares in a manner consistent with traditional shares. This alignment reinforces the view that TMMF shares can be accommodated within existing property law principles in Ireland, supporting their recognition and enforceability under Irish legal standards • Where an MMF is tokenized using a digitally native TMMF and is located in the UK, there is a low degree of legal uncertainty concerning the legal treatment of ownership and a similarly low level of uncertainty concerning the replication of rights for market participants between the traditional MMF and a digitally native TMMF • It is anticipated that further certainty will be available in the UK if the Property (Digital Assets etc.) Bill is enacted and common law precedent is developed as to the implications of the “third category” of property. Over 70 firms participated in the working group including S&P, Federated Hermes, R3, JP Morgan, Ownera, Finastra, Lloyds Banking Group, Hogan Lovells, LSEG, Archax, Blackrock, State Street, ISDA, EY, Commerzbank, Fireblocks, Northern Trust, Apex Group, Franklin Templeton, and Goldman Sachs.“As a co-chair of this working group, I have been impressed with the collaborative and effective working engagement across traditional financial institutions and fintechs as well as legal and professional services contributors and their firms. The combination of research and assessment findings and the practical sandbox execution of production use cases made this working group a very special and successful achievement,” said Armin Peter, GDF Executive in Residence who is also a former Global Head of Debt Syndicate EMEA at UBS and a, former GFMA Board Member. Sharon Lewis, Lead Partner for Future of Finance and Co-Chair of Digital Asset & Blockchain Practice, Hogan Lovells said: "There is relative legal certainty of TMMFs located in Luxembourg in a digitally native or registered form, where both Ireland and the UK have a low degree of uncertainty as the courts are likely to treat digitally native TMMF shares in a manner consistent with traditional shares. The cross discipline collaboration involved in this work has been outstanding and it is a credit to the industry participants."As part of the working group 30 of the firms participated in the GDF Industry Sandbox, powered by Ownera, the firm which operates the FinP2P routers that implement the open FinP2P standard to “prove” the production use case for collateral mobility in TMMFs. With no fundamental barriers identified across legal, operational and regulatory dimensions, the sandbox demonstrated that TMMFs can transition from theoretical use cases to a production-ready collateral instrument across six simulations:• Simulation 1: Simple Bilateral Transfer - Manual Margining of TMMFs • Simulation 2: Integrated Margin Calls - Automated Posting via Third-Party Systems• Simulation 3: Depeg Event and Substitution - Dynamic Portfolio Management• Simulation 4: Default Scenario - Enforcement and Recovery in Insolvency• Simulation 5: Funding of TMMF in Triparty• Simulation 6: From SWIFT to Collateral Settlement in Seconds.“Hosting the GDF Industry Sandbox was a monumental collaborative effort, bringing together some of the best-in-class market participants, custodians, and technology providers from across the industry. The results highlight what’s truly possible when we apply FinP2P and its DLT interoperability layer to collateral mobility and optimization,” said Natasha Benson COO and CFO of Ownera.Amarjit Singh, UK Digital Assets Leader, EY said: "The over 30 TradFi and Fintech firms participating in the sandbox have demonstrated that collateral mobility for TMMFs has arrived. This is an exciting next step in the continued uplift to the future market’s infrastructure, leveraging digital assets to bring real-world benefit to investors and financial institutions around the globe.”Lawrence Wintermeyer, GDF Member Board Chair added: “Testing the legal certainty of digital assets and demonstrating real production use cases is a time that has arrived for the global securities industry. This outstanding working group demonstrated it could engage the world’s best TradFi and digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dMFI) firms to collaborate and demonstrate to the whole of the industry and its regulators that digital finance has truly arrived. I look forward to the US working group kicking off in January 2026.”

Internally referred to as "B by Lenskart Smartglasses", the upcoming device is expected to integrate AI-based interactions, health and well-being insights and UPI payment capabilities. The launch of smart glasses, built on Gemini 2.5, could happen in the weeks following the company's stock market listing on November 10. The product's pricing has not been finalised yet, they added. "The smart glass aims to bring AI and commerce into the eyewear experience, where your glasses are not just for vision but also interaction and convenience," said one of the people cited earlier. The device is likely powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform, a chipset designed for lightweight augmented reality and camera-enabled AI applications. The assumption aligns with the strategic partnership announced between Lenskart and Qualcomm at the Snapdragon for India XR Day in July 2025, where both firms revealed plans to co-develop AR and AI solutions tailored for Indian consumers. Queries sent to Lenskart remained unanswered. Lenskart Solutions has launched a public offer to raise ₹7,278 crore at a valuation of nearly ₹70,000 crore ($8 billion) on October 31. The public issue, which was fully subscribed on the first day itself, will close on November 4. The company has also made a string of investments in AI, XR and computer vision startups over the past year, bolstering its in-house tech capabilities as it expands beyond traditional eyewear retail. This initiative forms part of Lenskart's broader strategy to evolve from a D2C optics player into a vision-tech ecosystem brand. If successful, Lenskart would become one of the first Indian consumer tech brands to commercialise AI-driven eyewear, competing with products such as Meta-Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon Echo Frames, but at a price point and design language suited to Indian users, the people familiar with the matter said.

Title: The ethos of the Dublin Six: ‘Classic, timeless pieces that are not going to date’

Irish fashion designers are discovering the advantages of collaboration. It’s what brought the Dublin Six – Jennifer Slattery, Ros Duke Knitwear, Freya Oatway of FAO Millinery, Caoimhe Grant of August Night, Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island and Amy Cahill of Oxmantown Skincare – together to create and style autumn-winter looks combining their respective talents in daywear, hats, jewellery, bags and body products. Their recent show in the restored Dublin’s Civic Trust building, sharing costs of the location, models and make-up, was an exercise in how, in an ever-demanding environment, co-operation and partnership can deliver results. It all began with Slattery and Duke discussing ways they could do a performance with other designers. Duke and Grant had worked together at John Rocha. The venue became a showcase “for our vision and shared ethos”, Grant says, “a one-stop shop where customers could buy”. Their catwalk show, Gathered Forms, after a collection specially designed for the occasion by Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island, was accompanied with music by Megan Nic Ruairí from northwest Donegal. “We wanted to bring some quietness and reflectiveness to our collections because everything is so fast paced. It’s about community over competitiveness and supporting each other. Every piece had a sculptural element to it inspired by art and nature,” Grant says. So who is the customer for the Dublin Six? “It’s the person who loves to support Irish design and who takes her time to choose,” Grant says. “She’s not into trends, preferring classic, timeless pieces that are not going to date, but is still interested in fashion. They are all easy pieces that come together well.” What such collaborations need and deserve is a bigger Irish design shop or location – a rotating space in which everyone has a chance to showcase their work. Such a venue would be a destination for both locals and tourists, creating awareness and visibility of the vibrant Irish fashion scene, which was evident last month at Dublin Independent Fashion Week – notably Ríon Hannora’s Sex Before Marriage bridal collection, Pellador showing womenswear for the first time, Conor O’Brien’s Phantom Thread collection, and Mihai Mar’s knitwear, alongside outstanding collections from Rashiid and the completely self-funded Caolum McCabe show at Henrietta Street. Both Slattery and Duke have had pop-ups recently in Kildare Village and are planning Christmas events in Slattery’s Smithfield shop in December. augustnight.ie, jenniferslattery.com, faomillinery.com, oxmantownskincare.ie, rosduke.com, innerisland.ie Ros Duke and August Night are both stocked in Emporium Kalu in Naas, Co Kildare; Jennifer Slattery in Slow Street in Blackrock, Co Dublin; August Night in Khan in Blackrock, Beo Wellness in Lahinch and Ennis, Co Clare; and Ellen B in Clontarf, Dublin; Oxmantown Skincare in Irish Design Shop in Dublin 2 and Project 29 in Stoneybatter, Dublin 7.

Transcription (Edited): Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Career Evolution in Iconic CPG Brands Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Local Ownership and Relationships in the Dairy Sector Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. CPG/FMCG as the Ideal Marketing Training Ground Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Product Trends and E-commerce in a Portfolio Strategy Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Distribution, Pricing, and the “Always On” Operation Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Brand Promotion and Distinctive Advertising Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely. The heritage was good for its time, but being much more consumer-focused—answering the question “what’s in it for me?”—is really important, and your approach does that. Darryn, time has run away from us. It’s been an absolute pleasure, and thank you so much for sharing what you’re doing at Bega Group. Darryn: No, I thank you for being able to spend this time. Hopefully, there are a few nuggets for your listeners to take out of our conversation.

Watch CBS News November 2, 2025 / 7:32 PM EST / CBS News Editor's note: On October 31, 2025, correspondent Norah O'Donnell spoke with President Donald J. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., and this is a transcript of that conversation. They started by discussing the president's recent meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, we get along great, and we always really have. We had the COVID moment, which was not-- attractive as far as I was concerned. I wasn't so happy. But outside of that, we have always had a great relationship. He's a powerful man. He's a strong man, a very powerful leader. And-- we've always-- had the best of relationships, probably the best of-- I could-- I think I could speak for him, just about as good as it gets from his standpoint and from my standpoint. And having that is important because of the power of the two countries. NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you get out of this deal that you wanted? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I got sort of everything that we wanted. We got-- no rare earth threat. That's gone, completely gone. We have tremendous amounts of-- dollars pouring in-- 'cause we have-- very big tariffs, almost 50%. We never had anything in terms of tariffs, although I put tariffs on China, but Biden let it lapsed by the-- by the fact that he gave exemptions on almost everything, which was just ridiculous. But-- we have-- billions and billions of dollars coming in, and we have a very good relationship. I mean, we have-- a great relationship with a powerful country. And I've always felt if we can make deals that are good, it's better to get along with China than not, if you can't make the right kind of a deal than not, because, you know, China, along with many other countries (they're not alone in this), they've ripped us off from day one. They've ripped us so much. They've taken trillions of dollars out of our country. And now they're-- it's the opposite. I mean, we're doing very well with China, and hopefully they're gonna do very well with us. But I do think it's important that China and the U.S. get along, and we get along very well at the top. NORAH O'DONNELL: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: As you mentioned, they were-- China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones to-- to build submarines. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- what was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiatior-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, when you say hurting-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --is President Xi-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because-- I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, "You know, we have to fight back." And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and-- and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. Now we are. I mean, we have tremendous rare earth, and it's going to be-- you know, it's going to be-- it'll be a strength, but it won't really be a strength if everybody has it. Everyone's gonna have it pretty soon. And they were doing it-- on a singular basis. Now-- they use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have-- hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting-- maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, "Look, if you don't open up, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying." And as soon as I said that, they came to the table. We met in South Korea, as you saw, right? A lot of people watched. And-- we made a really good deal. And it was good for them also, I hope. I mean, I want 'em to be good for both sides, but-- we'll be takin' in hundreds of billions of dollars-- in the form of tariffs. You know, tariffs are incredible, because they really give us great national security. As an example-- when they pulled the rare earth on us and the rest of the world, if we didn't have tariffs to fight back, I-- I immediately instituted a 100% tariff over and above what they were already paying. And when I did that, they immediately came to the table. Without tariffs, we would not have had that privilege. We would have-- not have had that right. Tariffs give us national security and great wealth. NORAH O'DONNELL: You talked about those rare earth minerals. Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: --I-- my understanding is about 90% of them come from China. That's their-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right now. NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But within a short period of time-- we'll have everything we need for ourselves. You know, we've instituted an emergency program, and we will have-- within a year from now to a year and a half, we'll have everything we need, no matter what kind of a threat is being-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How? How do we do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because we've taken over. First of all, you saw the partnerships w-- we've established with Japan, with Australia, with U.K., w-- with just about everybody, frankly. And we're all doing it together. You know, this wasn't a threat against the United States. This was really a threat against the world. So the w-- whole world has come together, I think, at our behest. And rare earths, in-- within two years, rare earths will cea-- really cease to be a problem. NORAH O'DONNELL: The one thing that China wants but it doesn't have is the world's most advanced semiconductors. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's what the United States has. Will you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Chips in particular. NORAH O'DONNELL: Chips. That's right-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you allow the chip maker, Nvidia, to sell their most advanced chips to China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. No, we won't do that. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's not on the table at all? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we will let them-- deal with Nvidia. Nvidia's the prime-- company in the world for that. And we will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced. The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because then they would win the AI race. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they wouldn't win it necessarily, but they would certainly have-- an equal advantage. Right now we're winning it because we're producing electricity like never before by allowing the companies to make their own electricity, which was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of. These massive plants that are being built are building their own electric generating plants along with the plant itself. And that gives them all the electric they need without going to an old grid that's, you know, 150 years old. And-- they're makin' it-- themselves, and then they're selling back any excess electricity into the grid, so we benefit in all ways. But most importantly, it allows the c-- the companies to go immediately forward. We're getting-- approvals done in two and three weeks. It used to take 20 years. And we are leading the AI race right now by a lot. We are leading it by numbers that people have no idea. It's been-- it's been really great. We've been very, very far-reaching for it-- th-- look, that's the new internet. That's the new everything all put together. The AI race is a big deal. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yep. NORAH O'DONNELL: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: They play the long game, including on our own soil. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We play the long game too. NORAH O'DONNELL: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And-- we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's-- I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just-- knocking them out-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Hmm. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --of the economy. They can produce things that we don't want to produce because it's not really worth our while-- making-- undergarments, makin' this-- you know, certain things. We don't want to do that, and we can buy them inexpensively from other places in the world while we can lead the world in AI, and chips, and lots of other things. Within-- two years from now, we'll have 40% or 50% of the chip market. What's happening here, the biggest companies are leaving Taiwan. They're coming into the United States because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: In how many years? You think we'll be producing-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think in two years, we'll start opening up plants and we'll have a very substantial portion of the chip market. Right now we have almost none. We should have had a hundred percent. If we had par-- if we had presidents that knew anything about business or knew what they were doing, because, frankly, they didn't. We lost 50% of our automobile business. It's all coming back. We lost a hundred percent of the chip-- you know, it used to be all Intel and other companies. And what happened is other countries came in, and they stole our chip business, and we didn't charge tariffs. If we would have charged let's say a 100% tariff, none of those companies would have left. But they all left. Now they're all coming back, Norah, because the only way they avoid the tariffs is to build in our country. If they build in our country, make their plant and make their product in our country, then it's a very simple thing. They-- they don't have any tariff to pay. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's what they want to do. And so instead of charging somebody a 100% tariff and you can make your product outside, they come in, and they make-- and this is why we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now. By the time it-- it-- just to show you how big that is, it's the biggest in history by many times. No other country's been any-- seen anything like it. The Biden administration in four years did less than a trillion. We have 17 trillion-- more than $17 trillion right now, and I'm in my ninth month. By the time we finish up, I think we're gonna have over $20 trillion invested in the United States or to be invested in the United States-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How will that trickle down to the average worker? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because of jobs, because they're building plants. W-- we're bringing back the auto industry into our country. We lost 58% of the automobile manufacturing business to other countries. You know, we used to be the king of automobile and automobile manufacturing, and now we're not really the king anymore, you know? Within a year and a half, two years, we're gonna be the king again. We're gonna-- the-- the-- as an example, I was also in Japan, as you know, and South Korea. We had-- the biggest Japanese companies are investing billions of dollars in building auto plants in the United States. If I weren't elected-- if I weren't elected, we would be losing all of these jobs. We would be losing far more of the auto industry. We would be nowhere in chips. Our country would have been bankrupt, and we would have had a bigger welfare roll. They would have expanded welfare and forgotten about everything else. Now we're building a country that's gonna be so strong, I don't know if you saw the last numbers in terms of employment. They're all non-government jobs. Not just government. Government jobs are easy. I could-- I could immediately inc-- do anything I want with government jobs. I'd just say, "We're gonna add up-- we're gonna add on a million government jobs," and you're gonna say, "Oh, what wonderful numbers." They don't mean anything. We are building jobs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But when all of these plants that are currently under construction and to be under construction, when they open, we're gonna have an economy like our country has never seen before, the strongest economy in the world. We're doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit-- perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It's hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my-- nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We're doing really well, and everybody knows it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's put it this way-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I-- can I ask you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people know it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people definitely-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --on that point, though? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It does. Oh, it does, it does. NORAH O'DONNELL: But there have been-- grocery prices are up-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But-- but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly. So the beef-- the ranchers have really taken a drubbing over a 30-year period. Because of what I've done, the ranchers have done well. But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden. All of these problems were caused by Biden, whether it's-- the people that came into our country through jails. I mean, they were released from jails. They were lease-- released from mental institutions into our country. These problems are caused by Biden. We had an open border. Now we have a border that's, as you know, absolutely shut other than-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --people are allowed to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. NORAH O'DONNELL: I do want to talk about immigration and some other- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --domestic issues. But just-- if we could stay on China for just a moment-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why not say it-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Taiwan is a very interesting case. It's 69 miles away from China. We're 9,500 miles away. But that doesn't matter. He understands-- what will happen. He and I have spoken about it. But it was never even brought up during a two and a ha-- or two-and-a-half-hour meeting we had yesterday. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, "He understands," why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I don't want to give away-- I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens. The other side knows, but-- I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's gonna happen. And-- he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, "We would never do anything while President Trump is president," because they know the consequences. NORAH O'DONNELL: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --immediately. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why do we need to test-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --our nuclear weapons? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to-- and the reason I'm saying-- testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I wanna be-- I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test. We have tremendous nuclear power that was given to us largely because when I was president (and I hated to do it, but you have to do it)-- I rebuilt the military during my first term. My first term was a tremendous success. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. But my second term is blowing it away. It's blowing it away when you look at the numbers, the stock market, the jobs. Look at the job numbers, how good they've been. And, again, I have costs down. Remember, Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- I w-- definitely want to talk about the economy, but I just want to make s-- sure we-- we button up this issue-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --on nuclear weapons. And I want to clarify this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Russia's-- no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it. NORAH O'DONNELL: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the-- delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w-- not with nuclear warheads- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report-- they don't have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do. No, we're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing. NORAH O'DONNELL: Not nuclear weapons, is my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course they have-- NORAH O'DONNELL: North Korea has, but not nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They-- they test way under-- underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make-- a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China-- and China does test, and we're gonna test also. NORAH O'DONNELL: So we are going to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't it sorta make sense? You know, you make-- you make nuclear weapons, and then you don't test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Apparently, we don't need to test our nuclear weapons, 'cause they're the best in the world, according to experts I've spoken with-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: According to me. We have the best, and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about. But if other people are gonna have 'em, we're gonna have to have 'em. And if we have 'em, we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them. And in the meantime, I've solved eight wars. I knocked out eight wars. I had eight wars-- I brought a little list for you if you'd like to see it-- but I took eight wars and stopped during an eight-month period, during eight months. Before the ninth month I stopped eight wars. The only one I haven't been successful yet in, and-- and that'll happen, is Russia Ukraine, which I thought actually would be the easiest one because I have a very good relationship with President Putin. But-- we are respected again as a country, and that's the way I've been able to stop the wars. I also stopped them because of trade. NORAH O'DONNELL: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Both tough. Both smart. Both-- look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not-- they're not walking in saying, "Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice." These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders. NORAH O'DONNELL: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine, that being the one war that you are not able to solve. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in-- Alaska. But there's been-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. But is-- but there's been no ceasefire-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I made-- yes, there isn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What's—is he ignoring you? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because he thinks-- because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. He even said that. That was a war that would've never happened. Joe Biden was the president. Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons, which allowed them to fight, 'cause we make the best weapons in the world. You know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. They used a lotta those weapons in that war. We make the best weapons in the world. Now we make even better weapons. But that was-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why won't Putin end this war? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that was-- but-- but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war. That should not have been a war. That would've never happened if I were president. And by the way, for four years it didn't happen. There was never even a doubt. Then the election was rigged and stolen, and all of a sudden you see them forming up at the line. And now I come back and I'm gonna get that one solved too. But I brought, I mean, just a little list of-- of-- look at this, wars. How many did I solve? Cambodia-- this is Cambodia Thailand. Kosovo Serbia. Congo-- the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, that was gonna be a beauty. They shot down seven planes. Israel and Iran, you've heard about that one? Egypt and Ethiopia, that's another beauty. Ethiopia built a big-- dam where there's no water going to the Nile. Armenia and Azerbaijan. And if you take a look, Israel and Hamas, which is a, you know, rough little situation, but it's gonna be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I do wanna talk about-- I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I did-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --pretty good. I-- I solved-- those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I-- NORAH O'DONNELL: When-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, "If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not gonna be able to do business with the United--" NORAH O'DONNELL: So why isn't that-- why isn't that working with Putin? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of-- foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. That's what I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you get it done in a couple months, do you think? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the U.S. But it did work with India, and it did work with-- Pakistan, and it did work with-- 60% of those countries. I can tell you, if it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals. But I stopped, as an example-- India does a lotta business with us. They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan. The-- Prime Minister of Pakistan stood up the other day and he said, "If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now." That was a bad war he was ready to start. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Shot down airplanes all over the place. That really-- that was gonna be a bad war. And I told both of them, I said, "If you guys don't work out a deal fast, you're not gonna do any business with the United States." And they do a lotta business with the United States. And they were both great leaders, and they worked out a deal, and they stopped the war. That would've been a bad war. It would've been a nuclear war. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna stay on the issue of foreign policy, and let's turn to our hemisphere. There have been at least eight boats in the Caribbean destroyed by the U.S. military-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately. NORAH O'DONNELL: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs-- they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons-- they emptied their prisons into our compan-- country. They also-- if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums-- into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But why is our aircraft carrier-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just finish. NORAH O'DONNELL: --going down there? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. We had the worst inflation, we had the worst of everything. But the worst thing he did was allow millions of people to come into our country that were many-- in many cases, criminals, murderers, 11,888 murderers were let into our country. Venezuela let a lot of those people in. But they were from all over the world. This isn't just Venezuela. They were from all over the world. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are gonna talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And what he did to our country should never be forgotten. He had an open-border process, and people would come in, and I'm not discriminating against tattoos, but people would come in with tattoos all over their faces, and say, "Come on in, come on in, come on in." They let people in that should've never been. Venezuela emptied their prisons into the United States of America. And every one of those boats that you see shot down-- and I agree, it's a terrible thing-- but every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: We will talk about immigration in a moment, but I just wanna talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to 60 Minutes as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think so. Look-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it about-- let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well we don't need to blow up boats in order to deal-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, okay? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero-- think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. And it was millions of people a year just a little more than a year ago. Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We had no idea who they were. And we're never gonna let that happen again. That's what made Biden the worst president, because you know what, inflation I've already taken care of. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country, and now we don't have inflation. It's at 2%. It's-- it's the perfect inflation. NORAH O'DONNELL: Aren't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But what made him so bad-- well, the weaponization of law enforcement, all of that. Look, he was bad in every way. But the worst thing that he did is allow millions, and millions, and millions of people to pour into our country unvetted, unchecked. And they were criminals, they were murderers, they were drug dealers, they were people from jails, and people from mental institutions. NORAH O'DONNELL: You-- you have had success on immigration, I wanna talk about that in a minute. But on Venezuela-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Big success. NORAH O'DONNELL: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't tell you that. I mean-- I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I-- you know, I wouldn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Why would we do it? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But-- because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm gonna strike. I'm not gonna-- you know, you're a wonderful reporter, you're very talented, but I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why do we need an aircraft carrier and all of group--strike group-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gotta be somewhere. It's a big one. NORAH O'DONNELL: I just think it-- it leads to the suggestion that the United States military is planning a larger operation involving Venezuela. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not gonna allow countries from-- what-- you know, it's countries from all over the world coming in. You know, they come in from the Congo where we just settled that war. But it come-- they come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular-- has been bad. They have gangs-- Tren de Aragua, do you ever hear of it? NORAH O'DONNELL: Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The most vicious gang anywhere in the world. They cut people's hands off if they call up the cops. You know, they call up the police and they said, "Did you call the police?" "Yes, I did. You took my apartment, you live in my building, you took my apartment." They cut his hand off. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "Don't ever call the police again." NORAH O'DONNELL: I fully underst-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are animals. Wait a minute. And they came in from Venezuela. Worst gang-- probably the worst gang, most vicious gang in the world. And you know what I did? In Washington, D.C., we had a lot of 'em. We took care of business. They're gone. Washington, D.C., right now is a very safe place, as it should be. Washington, D.C., be-- before I got here was almost like a crime capital of the world. It's the capital of this country. To me, it's the capital of the world. You see the way they treat me. I go to Japan, I go to South Korea, I go to Chi-- any place I go, and you know what I call that? Respect for our country. They didn't treat Biden that way. When Biden went there-- first of all, he hardly went anywhere. Guy couldn't leave his bedroom. But they didn't treat Biden that way. They had no respect for Biden falling up the stairs going to an airplane three times. I mean, this is a man who should've never been president. This was a rigged election. And we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --have to get back-- we have to get to the bottom of that also, because we don't want that to ever happen again. You see what's going on. We don't ever want that to happen again. Look what happened to our country by having Biden as the president. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country went to hell. And if we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about Israel-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --had another couple of years, if Kamala had won the election, our country right now would be finished. It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it's only gonna get better. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about Israel, as we're on foreign policy and talking about some of your successes. You got-- on Israel, you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not fragile. It's a very solid-- you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're gonna be taken out immediately. They know that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How do you get Hamas to disarm? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be-- they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are gonna be tough. But we were tough also, and they let 'em all out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You were tough-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, by the way, they're getting-- a lot of the bodies are coming out too. Did you know a lot of the parents-- this is very interesting-- were-- the people that lost their child, you know, mostly sons, but sons and daughters, they knew they were dead, in some cases. Do you know that they were as anxious or even more anxious of getting their child out, even though they knew it was a body that we were dealing with, than the people that had a living child-- a living, breathing child that they knew they were alive, if-- if barely, because the way they lived was so horrible. And-- you saw yesterday four more just came out. We're gonna get them out too. They're buried in many cases. They're buried under rubble. But we pretty much know where they were. But I didn't get just the 20 out. I got all of the hostages out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize-- to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's-- he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I-- I did a great job in pushing-- he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that-- has never been pushed before, actually. And that's the kind-- that's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should-- you know, we'll-- we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. But he's a wartime prime minister. I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped-- you know, I-- we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. Iran wants to make a deal. They don't say that, and they probably shouldn't say-- no good deal maker would. But Iran very much wants to make a deal. The key to Middle East peace-- I made Middle East peace. For 3,000 years they couldn't do it. I did it. And I did it with some very good partners in Israel. But the key to the Middle East peace was knocking the hell out of their potential-- nuclear. When we, with those beautiful B-2 bombers-- we just ordered 20 brand new ones, the newest and the greatest-- but with those beautiful B-2 bombers, when they went in there and they blew the hell out of that, you know, potential nuclear weapons site-- there were two of 'em, actually. And every single missile hit every single air shaft. You know, they had to go down an air shaft. Every single one of 'em hit their target. And I remember fake news CNN said, "Well, maybe it wasn't as powerful or as good as we thought." No, it was much-- turned out it was actually better. You know the Atomic Energy Agency said the hit was even stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And those pilots did a great job. What they were able to do-- and those machines. But it wasn't only them. They were surrounded by F-22s and F-16s. They were surrounded by F-35s. They were-- do you know we had 52 tanker planes, loading 'em up with jet fuel, because it was a long flight. They flied-- they flew for 37 hours. Of course, I flew for thirty-- 42 hours over the last three days, so I know how they feel. But they flew-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Except there's a bathroom on Air Force One-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --but they were sitting in one seat. I was-- I was able to walk around a little bit. But yeah, they said 42 hours. I've been in the air for 42 hours over a few days-- and that was fine, because we took in trillions of dollars into our country. And we also-- you know what's interesting, Japan took tremendous advantage of us over the years. You know, they sold cars to us, we couldn't sell cars to them. They made a fortune, we didn't make anything, we lost money. But it's the exact opposite now. But you know what? They like us more now than they used to because they respect us now. They didn't used to respect us, and they have great respect for us, all of 'em. Every country has-- including China. China now has great respect for us. They didn't have respect for us when they had Biden and when they had Obama. Obama was a terrible president. Nobody wants to talk about it because they wanna be politically correct. I don't care. He was a terrible president. Our country was-- it really started a very bad downward spiral. Then I stopped it, then we had a rigged election, and then-- what-- what Biden did to our country should never, ever be forgotten. NORAH O'DONNELL: We're still on-- on foreign policy, so I just have another question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm with-- I'm on all policy. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know you are-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about foreign-- no, no. I'm talking about everything. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, I just wanna-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm talking about economy, I'm talking about everything-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think he's gonna join. I-- I think-- we will have a solution. I don't know if it's gonna be two-state. That's gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me. But-- look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you wanna know-- do you wanna know-- they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you wanna know that-- the pilots, I invited them to the White House-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines, these big, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful wings that carry massive 100,000-pound bombs, and you don't-- I personally-- I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. They're-- they were beautiful-looking people. They were-- they're real-- I mean, they're real American heroes, and I thought they deserved to be invited. And I invited 'em to the White House, the Oval Office, including the mechanics and the people behind the scenes, I invited-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a lot of 'em. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, "Sir, for 22 years we've been practicing this route. Our predecessors," obviously, before them-- but "our predecessors and ourselves, for 22 years we've been practicing this hit, three times a year, every year, for 22 years. And you were the only president that let us do our job." I said, "Let me ask you. Is this a job you wanted to do?" "Yes, sir, 'cause it was the right thing." These are really brave people. These are really amazing people, and talented people. When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded and beat the hell out of it, I'll tell you what, they deserve to come to the White House. I gave 'em all a medal. They deserve to come to the White House. And it was a pleasure to meet 'em. These are great people. We have great people in this country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, we've talked about foreign policy, now let's focus on issues here at home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --some of that you have already mentioned. We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats' fault. NORAH O'DONNELL: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, "Give us an extension, we'll work it out." They don't wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for him, but the polls are turning around because-- not turning around. I just saw a poll where they're down 20-25%. What's happening is the people understand they're losing so much, they call it Trump derangement syndrome. They are losing so much that they don't know what to do. They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, "Let's vote." And you can open the-- the economy could open up during our interview-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do, though-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe it did. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All I can do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to bring this to an end? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is give the facts. Here's what I can't do. I can't give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally. So that prisoners, and that people from mental institutions, and people that are drug dealers get vast amounts of money for healthcare. That I can't do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my under-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I can do is I can continue to run a great country. We have the best economy we've ever had. I can continue to do that. What they should do-- look, this started a long time ago. I always said-- and you know I've been very consistent-- Obamacare is terrible. It's bad healthcare at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. But, you know, people are gonna get an 18-19% increase in Obamacare. It was a faulty program, it should've never been approved. But it was approved. NORAH O'DONNELL: So now that we're in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we fix it it'll be-- one of the greatest achievements. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But if ending the government shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country-- and you know what they have to do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So your plan-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of ''em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote the-- to end the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Correct, very simple. NORAH O'DONNELL: And that you will put forward a healthcare plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We will work on fixing the bad healthcare that we have. Right now, we have terrible healthcare and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people. NORAH O'DONNELL: But Mr. President, with all due respect-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people are paying-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --you've been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. We were one vote short. And coupla Senators that we currently have made the mistake, and they-- they made a big mistake. John McCain made a mistake, frankly. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. And I've been saying ever since, "We can fix it. It's too expen--" it's got two things. It's too expensive, and it's lousy healthcare. It's too expensive for the people. They're gonna get a very big increase this year. And it's because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they're gonna get an increase if they don't-- if you don't extend the subsidies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But the subsidies is part of it. We're supposed to spend trillions of dollars to take care of something that-- that is defective. What I'm saying is, we can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better healthcare. And I'd be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --willing to work with the Democrats-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --one Republican would ever do that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just button that up? Because the extension of these Obamacare subsidies, if they are not extended is that's what the Democrats are pushing for. I know you understand that. Tens of millions of Americans will see their monthly payments double. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. It's going to double-- NORAH O'DONNELL: That's a lot. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --anyway. It's gonna double anyway-- NORAH O'DONNELL: My understanding is, it's just the...but can I-- may I just-- my understanding is, if those healthcare subsidies are not expan-- extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if the subsidies are not extended, they're not gonna be able to afford health insurance-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. It was a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president, not nearly as bad as Biden, by the way, who by the way is building a museum that's, like, four times over budget. It'll never open, built in a neighborhood that-- you know, it's just not gonna work. The neighborhood doesn't even want 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's a disaster. The same guy that did his museum, which is a total catastrophe, came up with a bad healthcare plan. And for the sake of one vote, we would have had, you know, it's so sad thinking back-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But how-- I guess the question is-- I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had the vote, that one vote, we would have great healthcare at a much lower cost, and that's what I want. But I don't want to give $1.5 trillion to prisoners and drug dealers and-- and the people that-- that came into our country from mental institutions. What they allowed to come into our country, and we're getting 'em out, but what they allowed to come into our country, Norah, is horrible. So-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can make it good. NORAH O'DONNELL: I don't want to get into a back-- too much of a back and forth on this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but here's all I have to do. Open up the country. Open up the country. NORAH O'DONNELL: You mean, end the shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We only need five of the-- of their votes. We only need five votes, and already a couple of Democrats, a few Democrats are already voting. They want to open up. And we'll fix all of those problems. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're st-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those problems are much easier than what I just did with solving all these wars. NORAH O'DONNELL: Last question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had-- wait a minute, we had nine wars on our planet. I solved eight of 'em. I have one to go, Russia-Ukraine. I thought that was gonna be one of the easier ones but it's not because Putin is tougher than people thought-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You have-- you-- you have helped these government shutdowns in the past when it came about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: And you did it by bringing back-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm very good at it, but I'm not gonna do it by-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You brought members of Congress to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I'm not gonna do it by extortion-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to the White House. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The-- there's something wrong with these people. NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November 15th-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer-- Schumer is a basket case. NORAH O'DONNELL: --when the troops don't get a paycheck? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer is a basket case. He's gonna be defeated in the next election by a vast number of people. And he has nothing to lose. He's become-- I just left Japan. He's become a kaz-- kamikaze pilot. This guy-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like-- it sounds like this is not gonna get solved-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is, this guy is a kamikaze. He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well. But the people don't want that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's, I know, I hear you. It sounds like-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So we have a record-setting country right now, and we're not gonna be extorted by a man who's grossly incompetent, who-- who is gonna be defeated by any one of five different candidates. We're not gonna let that happen-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like this is not gonna get solved. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it? NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like it's not gonna get solved, the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gonna get solved, yeah. Oh, it's gonna get solved. NORAH O'DONNELL: How? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're gonna have to vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they have to. I mean, look, I-- I use the word kamikaze, not freely. I don't like to have to use that word. They are kamikazes, but there are gonna be four or five Democrats that come. We need five. They're gonna come and vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster. NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you see John Thune said today they're not gonna do that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know John doesn't-- well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not gonna lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what? NORAH O'DONNELL: So you think John-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't-- I don't even know-- actually, I don't even know his attitude on the filibuster, but I think we should do it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He j-- he said today he wasn't gonna do it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's too bad. You know, I mean, I think we're much better off. 'Cause here's the problem. The Democrats will do it in the first week in office. The Democrats, and I told that to John. The de-- and I get along with him great. We've had a great relationship-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Yes. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I also know there are other Republicans that feel the other way. And I understand that too, but they're wrong. The Democrats will do it. If they get into power and someday I guess they will. Who knows? It's hard to believe when they have men in women's sports, open borders, open everything, a transgender for everyone. The Democrats will do it in their first day in office, and the only reason they didn't do it is because of Sinema and because of a man named Joe Manchin from West Virginia-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Senator Kyrsten Sinema--. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --good man. And they disagreed with it. Now wait. Had they approved it, I think just one of 'em, had they been able to get those votes, you would have had the nuclear option used. You would have had the filibuster ended, and the Democrats would have used it. So I say to the Republicans that want to be, you know, all like, "Oh, well, we-- you know, we're above all that," the Democrats will do it. See, the Republicans have much better policy. We have smart policy. We have great policy. That's how we win. The Democrats are vicious. They're vicious. They have horrible policy, but they are the most vicious human beings on Earth. They are people that weaponize government. They do a lotta bad things. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the good thing is, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of winning is, they have the worst policy of-- it's hard to believe. Think of it. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. I mean, I could go point-- these are not 80:20-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --these are 99:1 issues. And they don't change. I just watched this morning a show where-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I ask you about the-- the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, just-- just one thing. I watched a show this morning where a very well-known Democrat Congressman was fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. They don't change it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Who was that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell. You'll be able to check it. Just check your local TV. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is gonna hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Supreme Court right now. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very close rulings, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that-- and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had 401(k)s. Because of tariffs, I've ended six of the eight wars that I've ended, and it'll end up being used also for the last war in a different way. Because of tariffs and the economy, but because of tariffs, we have a great economy. Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again. Because of tariffs, tremendously good things happened. Because of tariffs, our country is respected again. Because of tariffs, a president-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So what if the Supreme-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute. Because of tariffs, President Xi allowed us to win every single point. He bought billions and billions of dollars of-- of our soybeans, of our everyth-- it was the money they're spending. When I came out, did you see what happened with the farmers? They're having rallies for Trump right now because of tariffs. Because it gives us national security. If we didn't have tariffs, and remember this. Tariffs are used against us. Let me talk about that lawsuit. That lawsuit against us was instituted and backed by foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. They don't want it because they were rippin' us off for years. And if we lose that lawsuit, they'll continue to rip us off and you're not gonna end up with a country. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. If they don't-- if they take away the power of tariffs from us, and it has to be quick and nimble, you can't have Congress, well, hundreds of people have to look. They can't even agree to continue a country. You can't have Congress here. This has to be quick and nimble. As an example-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you just-- finish that sentence. You said, "If they take away my power to do tariffs," what? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It would be a very sad day for the United States of America. We're making a lot of money. We're respected again all over the world. We have great national security. Let me give you an example. With China, they were, you know, very strongly threatening us frankly with the rare earths. And then I said, "Well, if you're gonna play that card, I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on over and above what you're already paying," which was 55%, which was very high. A lotta money coming in, tremendous money like we've never seen. "I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on everything over and above." And you know what happened? We got a phone call 20 minutes later. "We'd like to talk." If they take away the right to tariff, if they-- if-- if we're forced to use Congress to approve, they can't approve anything. They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs. If they take-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You want that power. You want that executive power. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure-- tariffs are national security. If you take away the right to tariff, and remember this. NORAH O'DONNELL: And-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tariffs have been used against us. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you just answer that question that tariffs have led to inflation? They have led to an increase in cost of living for most Americans-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't led to inflation. We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn't have tariffs. He didn't use tariffs. NORAH O'DONNELL: For the average American-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why he didn't use 'em? 'Cause he's not smart enough to use 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the companies say they passed on more than 30% of these costs to the American consumer off the tariffs-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, ready, are you ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Somebody has to pay for it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. You have to pay, but we don't have any inflation. Inflation is the que-- is the real test of paying. Everybody said, "Oh, if you do tariffs, you're gonna have inflation." So Biden had the highest inflation in the history of our country by far, okay. No tariffs. I have very modest tariffs compared. Let me tell you. These tariffs ultimately are so good that at some point when they're used properly, and I use them more properly than anybody's ever even dreamt possible, think of it. We become rich. We're taking in trillions of dollars. And I have no inflation. And I have total national security. When I put the 100% tariff on China over and above what they were already paying, which was about 55%, so 155%, they came to the table immediately and they made a deal with us that was a very fair deal. That's called national security. And then I didn't make 'em pay the 100%. That would have been instituted. That would have come to fore on November 1st. Norah, Norah, listen to me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know our time with you is limited. I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I didn't have the power of tariff, we would be-- we would be like a subject nation. We'd be subject to everyone else. Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate-- we would be a third world nation. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through another-- more of these topics. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Immigration. I mean, you campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did great job, don't you think? NORAH O'DONNELL: --and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. Want to ask you about this. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the-- by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We've been held-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You're okay with those tactics? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions. I feel badly about that, but they're released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they're killers. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's what I'm-- oh we're doin' that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --rapists. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what we're doing-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --farmworkers. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, look, look. NORAH O'DONNELL: The family of US service members-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: But was it your in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We-- and we want to-- we focus on the bad ones, and we've gotten tremendous numbers of bad people. Don't forget. NORAH O'DONNELL: The-- there-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you have over 11,000 murderers released into our country, over 11,000, 50% of which have murdered more than one person, we gotta get 'em outta here. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're gonna go out. However, you've also seen, you're gonna go out. We're gonna work with you, and you're gonna come back into our country legally. Because we have a lotta good people. We have some great people. But, you know, the problem we have, and people don't like talking about-- these are very-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But there isn't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait. These are very smart countries. Their leaders are very smart. They're very street-wise. They might not have gone to the finest schools, but they're very street-wise. They want-- they don't want, they have good people. They want people that are bad out. So they, what do they do? They open their jails. They let 'em out. They get rid of their drug dealers. They let 'em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren't working. In other words, they have people that just don't work. They don't want people that just don't work, so they put them into our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if someone has been in this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we've accepted all of these people because of Biden's open border policy where people would walk in totally unchecked and unvetted, murderers and everybody else. NORAH O'DONNELL: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was ten or-- I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. Many of them. But we're-- we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals. When I look at D.C. now, you can walk down the middle of the street. You can have your daughter who's ten years old meet you at the park. She's gonna be okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: In certain parts of D.C.-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She woulda been murdered. Well, I-- in almost-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I live in D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you tell me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Certain parts of D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How big a difference is D.C. now compared to what it was a year ago? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right? I mean, you have to be honest with me. People walk-- people in the White House, they walk up to me, young ladies I've never seen. "Sir, thank you very much." I know-- I-- they don't even have to tell me what they're thanking me for. But when I ask why? He said-- she-- one girl said, "I'd get into Uber and I felt dangerous even in an Uber." They'd attack the car, okay. It wasn't even safe then. "Sir, I now walk to work every day and I walk, I-- I-- I-- I'm so safe. I f-- there's nothing going to happen. 100% safe." And you know that too, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about the s-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You live here. You know that too. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about amer-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --American cities-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --in Washington, D.C.? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: I think I've been working too hard. I haven't been out and about that much-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's not a fair answer. You see the difference. NORAH O'DONNELL: I get in my car and go to work and I go home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good. You don't have to use that one. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to embarrass her. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've been working too hard-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's-- it's like you know what the difference is? Like, day and night. NORAH O'DONNELL: I want to ask you more about some American cities. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are about-- we're on the eve a number of big state and local elections. One of the most watched is the one for Mayor of New York City. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL:. . . he is, Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old Democratic Socialist. He's the front runner-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Some-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --he's far worse than a Socialist. NORAH O'DONNELL: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I'm a much better looking person than him, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Well, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who you know is campaigning for mayor, he recently said that "If Mamdani becomes Mayor of New York City that you will take over New York." Cuomo said this. He said, "He will be President Trump and Mayor Trump. He's gonna take over New York and send tanks down Fifth Avenue." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What if Mamdani becomes mayor? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time. I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far. And it's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a Communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, "If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard." What does that mean, send more than the National Guard? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Do you know that we have a place called Chicago that, with a very bad governor. They threw him outta the family business. He became governor. Do you know that 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship. 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship, and yet he won't let us bring in the National Guard. He won't let us bring in-- in Chicago-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But when you say, "Send in more than the National Guard," what does that mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, more would be Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. NORAH O'DONNELL: So you're gonna send the military into American cities? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. Do you know how many presidents-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you-- what would be the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: What would-- what would cause you to do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? NORAH O'DONNELL: Tell me. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Almost 50% of 'em. Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? Twenty-eight times. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. I haven't chosen to use it, but if I-- because I've done well without it. But if I needed it, I could do it. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about-- another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is this political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You mean, do you think it's bad that I went after a public figure? NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. I got indicted. They indicted the President of the United States. You know, they impeached me twice and I got out of it quickly and easily? They impeached me twice. These people are scum. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Terrible. I just won the case against her. She wanted me to pay $500 million for something I didn't do anything wrong on. And the judge just overturned the-- the decision. So and then you-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Have you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait. And then you tell me about me. Just so you understand, you say I went after these people. These people are bad people. They're dishonest people. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, I was just asking, is it political retribution-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Comey's a dirty cop. Look, Comey's known as a dirty cop. I'm not known as a dirty person. They indicted me many times, indicted me. They were after me. I'm lookin' at you now. I'm President of the United States. I went through numerous indictments and two impeachments. And you tell me that I went after people? These people are dishonest. Look. Biden didn't have a clue. He illegally used, as you know, a machine, the autopen in order to give pardons to people. The only pardon he signed it looks like was his son, Hunter. He signed Hunter's, so, "Hunter, you're free, con-- congratulations, Hunter." But everyone else, I think those pardons are all just, were just a waste of time. Those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute, those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did I what? NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doin' a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automatically. But they instructed them to go after me, because the records now have been found. So when you tell me about I went after Comey, Comey's low on the totem pole. They went after the President of the United States. Do you know that they raided my house in Palm Beach, Florida called Mar-a-Lago? They raided my house. I had 78 or 98 FBI agents with arms-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know how you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --come into my house. And you're telling me, Norah, that I went after some low-life named Comey, who's judged to be a crooked guy. He lied all over the place. He lied to Congress and did many other bad things. NORAH O'DONNELL: But I was just asking, has this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: For that, you should be ashamed. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, no. I was just asking, is this-- is this retribution on your part? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. But even during my term, on a perfect phone call, I got impeached. This call was perfect. Tim Scott, from South Carolina, highly respected, a legitimate person totally legit, he read the tran-- thank goodness we had a transcript of the call. The call I got indicted on, a call on Ukraine of all places, with the President of Ukraine. It was a perfect phone call. Tim Scott said, "I just read the transcript. The President didn't do anything wrong, was perfect." And that was the end of the indictment pretty much. But I had to go through a whole process. You know, the Democrats knew that I wasn't guilty, because they didn't know the-- the call was-- I didn't know either, the call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call. When they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, "You made me go into this mess." She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like Schiff, et cetera, et cetera. So what happened is, she went nuts and just to conclude, and they said, "Let's do it anyway." They did it anyway, and I won very easily as you know. But you can't then accuse me of weaponizing government. They were horrible human beings. They went after the President of the United States. They went after my children. They went into my wife's-- drawers. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They went into my wife's closets. They held the dresses up. She came back. She said, "Oh, what happened? What happened?" 'Cause she's a very meticulous person. Everything's nice and neat. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've heard you talk about it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All of a sudden, everything's, like, they went into my office. They took things that I was allowed to have file-- under the Presidential Records Act that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have 'em. Only the president's allowed, but I was-- and it was nothing very significant anyway. There was, like, nothing. Wait, just one second. They opened these-- I'm a very meticulous person too. I have files, beautiful. They took the files, threw 'em all over the phone-- all over the floor. They were all over the floor-- and they took pictures of 'em. This is my office. I said, "What the hell? That's not my office." They took files, they threw 'em all over, and they took pictures and they released 'em to the public that this is "President Trump's office. We caught him with all of this stuff," like it was all over the floor in my office. These are crooked people. These are the same. So don't ask me about, "Did you go after?" Letitia's-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Letitia James, in my opinion, and I only say in my opinion 'cause I guess the lawyers would prefer that I say that 'cause I have a much stronger opinion, she's a total crook. She's a low-life. Comey's a dirty cop. Bolton actually helped me a lot because he was crazy. He's the one who want, him and-- and Cheney, a couple people got Bush to go out and blow the hell outta the Middle East and then take-- you know, then leave. And actually, Bolton helped me 'cause every time somebody saw Bolton standing behind me, foreign countries, they conceded. You know why they conceded? 'Cause they said, "Bolton's a nut job. Trump is gonna take us to war." But I don't listen to people that are stupid. Go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: And I know my time is-- is limited with you so I want to be respectful of-- of you, Mr. President. The issue of political violence I want to get to, because you were nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania. Charlie Kirk. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yup. NORAH O'DONNELL: Was assassinated. Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro's house was firebombed. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh-huh. NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota lawmaker murdered. What's your message to those on the left and the right who would seek to commit acts of violence? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think primarily on the left. A little bit of both, but I think primarily on the left. I think they have to tone it down. I think they have to approve the shutdown so it's not shut down. I think it's very bad what they're doing. They're hurting people. You know, if you think about it, if people aren't gonna get paid, there're gonna be, you know, a lot of angry people out there. They want to get their food. They want to get the money so they can live. In some cases-- whatever they want to get, they want to get. I think by the Democrats not giving us the votes, I think it's-- I think it endangers both parties. I think it's very bad. There's never been a case like this. This is, you know, this is fairly standard stuff. You do auto-- extensions are almost automatic. In fact, they were virtually automatic. This is the only time they don't want to do the extension, because they're losing so badly that they said, "Maybe we have some leverage." One of the Senators said that. "Maybe this is the first time we have some leverage." NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they really don't have leverage, because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're at a breaking point? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the Republicans can't be extorted in order to ruin our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you feel like we're at a breaking point? Given everything that you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. NORAH O'DONNELL: --just said? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, over-- over history? NORAH O'DONNELL: Well. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Sure, but the political violence that, you know, we just outlined. The number of-- of members of people in public that have been targeted-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's-- that's a different question. Yeah, I think-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --that have been targeted. And then I just read that there's now a number of your cabinet secretaries and aides who are now living on military bases. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Usually when people talk they're not the problem. It's the ones that don't talk, in terms of that. But-- yeah, I-- I think it's-- it's a lot of the rhetoric. Look, they call me a Nazi all the time. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite. I'm somebody that's saving our country. But they call me Nazi. They have talking points, you know? They have just talking points. And the press is-- is largely responsible for it. The fake news, what they've done-- I think one of the greatest terms I've ever come up with is fake news. What they've done to our country is very bad. They have to change around. Now, nobody believes the fake news. Nobody believes 'em. I mean, they've gone, you talk about popularity, you talk about approval, their approval numbers have gone f-- from, like, in the 90s to in the teens now. We need borders. We need fair votes. And you really need a fair press. If you-- and you do, you have some great journalists and great reporters. But you have some terrible, terrible, dishonest journalists. And I see it all the time, because I'll give 'em a story and they'll have it. Even my trip with China, it was so successful. But of all, the Wall Street Journal, they said, Trump Lowers Tariffs. That was the headline. Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't what happened. I lowered tariff-- tariffs in order to get everything that anybody could possibly dream of. The point wasn't lowering tariffs. I put up a high number, I cut it, and I got everything. And yet the headline in the Wall Street Journal, beautiful picture of myself and President Xi, everything nice. But the headline was Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't the story. The story was Trump got everything, got everything. Including world peace. We're respected as a country. We're not threatened right now. And we're not gonna be threatened. As long as we have a strong, smart president, we're never gonna be threatened by anybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well. NORAH O'DONNELL: --Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not gonna try and run for a third term? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't wanna use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. We're talking 3 and ¼ years-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do like J.D. Vance. I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Or secretary-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Marco Rubio. I like-- I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. We could run two people together. We have a great bench. So I don't wanna start talking about elections. It's too early. One thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged. And a lotta people say when it's rigged you're allowed to do it again. It was rigged. And it's been caught. And they-- and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it's coming out now in spades. But with all of that, we have a great bench. We have unbelievable people. You could go up and down my cabinet, we have great people. They don't. They have a guy that's ruined the state of California, ruined it, destroyed it. And I have a lotta property out there, I can tell you they've ruined the state of California. He has been terrible. Other than he's got a good line of--bullshit, that's all it is. He's ruined the state. And he's one of the people running. Jasmine Crockett, she's a low-IQ person. They say she might run for president, Jasmine Crockett. This is a very low-IQ person. AOC, I watched her speak the other day, almost the first time she was screaming. She was like a crazy person. Her-- she's got-- not a good speaker. Doesn't have, I don't think, but you never know what it is. You never know what it is c-- that can spark an election. When Joe ran first time I thought he was terrible. He was horrible. I-- I won by a lot. The second time he was running he was doing very poorly, he had a bad debate, and they replaced him in the middle the election. That never-- this could only happen to me. They replaced him with somebody, the press got behind her. Oh, they were so behind her. But eventually she failed because she couldn't speak. She wasn't a very intelligent person, in my opinion. But she couldn't speak properly. She could not speak. And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don't have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not-- you have a great-- I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, 'cause the young woman that's leading your whole enterprise is a great-- from what I know. I don't know her, but I hear she's a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me-- a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening. I see-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Because, you know, what we've done, what we-- I inherited a mess. And I've fixed it, other than it will take a while to get all the criminals, the real criminals, the ones-- the real bad ones, out. But we've gotten a lot of them out. We've gotten a lot of the murderers out. We've gotten a lot of the people from jails out and we've taken 'em back to their countries. In some cases they're so dangerous that we've actually had to put them in our jails because we didn't want 'em coming back. I wanna just keep it going pretty much the same way. I want safety in our cities. Our cities are a mess. And I hate to say it, they're Democrat-run cities. If you take the top 25 cities, they're almost all-- almost every one of 'em is run by Democrats. NORAH O'DONNELL: And to people that say they're-- struggling with the cost of living, expenses-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, cashless bail-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What could you do about that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just say, cashless bail is a disaster. It's gotta be changed. Sanctuary cities really have to be changed. They're sanctuary, you know what they're sanctuary for? Criminals. Things-- some basic things have to be changed. But one of the things I really have focused on is making Chicago great again. Making-- and we're just getting started in Chicago. But what we did in D.C., where we took D.C. from being so bad to so beautiful, such good-- the restaurants are booming. You can't get into a restaurant. They were closing and now they're all opening every-- you can't get a restaurant now. You can't get into a restaurant. But you c-- if you wanna buy a restaurant or-- or own a restaurant you almost can't find it. I wanna make this happen all over the country. I want it to be like that in New York, in L.A., in Chicago. I wanna do it as much as you can. You know, by the way, Memphis, we're there now. Memphis was a dangerous hellhole. 65% down in crime. And this is after two weeks. We can do it all over the place. It's turned out to be a new passion for me, making our city-- I had no idea we could be that successful. I thought it would take a much longer period of time. Do you know in Washington, in 12 days it was really good. In one month it was close to perfect. NORAH O'DONNELL: And for those that are suffering with cost of living increases and saying they're living paycheck to paycheck-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd be very upset with-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Prices are up PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Biden. Because we don't have any of those problems. We-- we don't have inflation. You know, essentially we don't have inflation. We-- I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country. We don't have infl-- we're down to 2%, even less than 2%. A couple of items like beef I'm getting down. But our groceries are down-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Healthcare-- healthcare premiums? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can fix healthcare, give them better healthcare for less money. Obamacare is-- is hurting people. Obamacare was a disaster from day one. I can fix it and make it good. I'd really rather start with a fresh plate, but if it's-- if it's required to keep it, we can make it much better. But it's bad healthcare, and they're gonna get big increases, and that has nothing to do with me. That has to do with the fact that it was originally put into play. It's a shame. But we can make it better. Energy is way down. You know, you're gonna have $2 gasoline very soon. Nobody could believe it. You were at $4, $5, $6, and even $7. Look at the cost of gasoline in California. What it was, I brought it down. The problem is when I bring it down here in California they put more tax. They-- they tax the gasoline to such an extent. No, we're in great shape. This country is in great shape. We're ready to really rock. As I say often-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you-- are you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we were a dead country. We were a dead country one year ago. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Leaders have said that to me. Just recently they said that to me. Even President Xi, he said, "I'd like you-- you to be congratulated." He said it so beautifully. "I'd like you to be congratulated on the incredible job you did in bringing back the United States of America." President Xi said that to me. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know we're out of time, but just on that matter, we talked about that-- because I know how closely you follow the stock market. Do you worry about an AI bubble? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess. I worry about everything, you know? I mean, you know, I'm a worrier. I worry. But you know what I do? I worry and then I fix it. I fix it. That way I don't have to worry. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's a lotta money behind AI-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lotta money. And right now I'm taking advantage of it, because we're leading AI. You know, we're leading it by a lot. China's in second place, but we're leading it by a lot. We have the greatest minds of any country anywhere in the world, and we're using that. I'm using those great minds to help us. Now, will something happen later? I guess, you know, something. But it could also be something very good happens. And I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected. Our country is doing great. We're strong. We're solid. We've never been-- I think we haven't been like this in-- maybe ever. Maybe ever. We have a great country, and you should be very proud of it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you very much for your time-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL:Thank you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do I have the opportunity to ask you two more questions? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want, if it helps-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Okay. Two more questions-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That means they'll treat me more fairly if I do-- I want to get-- It's very nice, yeah. Now is good. Okay. Uh, oh. These might be the ones I didn't want. I don't know. Okay, go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is everybody ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: This is a question about pardons. The Trump family is now perhaps more associated with cryptocurrency than real estate. You and your son-- your sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have formed World Liberty Financial with the Witkoff family. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Helping to make your family millions of dollars. It's in that context that I do wanna ask you about crypto's richest man, a billionaire known as C.Z. He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Looked at this, the government at the time said that C.Z. had caused "significant harm to U.S. national security", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt. And what I wanna do is see crypto, 'cause if we don't do it it's gonna go to China, it's gonna go to-- this is no different to me than AI. My sons are involved in crypto much more than I-- me. I-- I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry. And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence. But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He's highly respected. He's a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it. I said, "Eh, it may look bad if I do it. I have to do the right thing." I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him. Maybe I did. Or, you know, somebody shook my hand or something. But I don't think I ever met him. I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration. NORAH O'DONNELL: The government had accused him of "significant harm to U.S. national security"-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the Biden government. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Allowing U.S. terrorist groups to, you know, essentially move millions of dollars around. He pled guilty to anti-money laundering laws. That was in 2023. Then in 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But he got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can only tell you that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Norah, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government. And they're good-- my one son is a number one bestseller now. My wife just had a number one bestseller. I'm proud of them for doing that. I'm focused on this. I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government. It's a corrupt government. Biden was the most corrupt president and he was the worst president we've ever had. I only care about one thing. Will crypto be-- will we be number one in crypto? Crypto has turned out, and in that sense I've been right. Crypto's turned out to be a massive industry, if you wanna call it that. And I'm very proud to say that we are far and away ahead of China and everybody else. Now, China is getting into it very big, right now. If you wanna go after people, you're gonna kill that industry. And it'll be very bad. Tremendous number of jobs. I campaigned positively on crypto, very openly. I campaigned. Biden campaigned against it. When Biden found out that I was getting, like, 100% of the crypto vote, which was a lot, he switched totally and he went in favor of crypto. They were totally in favor. They had many people under indictment. They let 'em all go. They let 'em all go. You know that. Many people were under indictment. Biden was a corrupt president. Biden went all in on crypto at the very end because he thought he could get some votes. It didn't work. They voted for me. I wanna make crypto great for America. That's the only thing. I don't wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto. Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two. And right now we're number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way. NORAH O'DONNELL: So not concerned about the appearance of corruption with this? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't say, because-- I can't say-- I'm not concerned. I don't-- I'd rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, "Can I ask another question?" And I said, yeah. This is the question-- NORAH O'DONNELL: And you answered-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda walked away. I didn't have to answer this question. I'm proud to answer the question. You know why? We've taken crypto-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But just generally speak-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We're number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They're fighting like hell to be. But we're number one in crypto because I'm the president. Biden wanted to also, at the very end, you know, he totally switched his thing. You know, Biden was totally in favor of crypto at the end. Do you know that many people that were indicted under Biden for crypto, at the very end before the election, were let go? You know why? He wanted the vote. We are number one in crypto and that's the only thing I care about. I don't want China or anybody else to take it away. It's a massive industry. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. (01:13:50) Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

November 02, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Nov. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 27th issue of our Weekly Report, also our first Half-Year Edition. Many investors have told us that reading this weekly report has already become a habit. It not only records the growth of FF and FX but also represents the process of fulfilling our commitments and co-creating the future together. To begin, here are three pieces of good news to share with everyone: Firstly, FF officially signed a Strategic Advisory Agreement with Chris Nixon Cox, grandson of former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Board Member of the Nixon Foundation, to accelerate the implementation of the company’s “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge Strategy. We are very pleased to collaborate with Chris, a highly influential figure across the global political and business arenas with strong leadership in investment, policy, and regulatory affairs. We believe these valuable experiences could play an important role in helping FFAI achieve success at this pivotal stage of global expansion. Secondly, global asset management giant Vanguard’s Q3 13G filing showed it held about 7.1 million FFAI shares, up 36 percent from the end of Q2. Thirdly, following the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch, we signed with three B2B partners and received non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders from them totaling more than 200 units of FX Super One, outperforming the initial target we had set. For the luxury EAI-MPV market in the Middle East, which is still in its early stage, achieving such results in such a short time as a new entrant proves that the groundwork we’ve laid over the past two years under our Three-Pole Strategy is truly paying off. With that, let’s dive into other progress we made this week in the EAI flywheel. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery: The software and hardware upgrades and integration of the EAI F.A.C.E. production version, the most anticipated feature of our Super One, are now underway. The upgraded product could deliver an even more transformative EAI F.A.C.E. experience for our users. On S5 Capital Market and Finance: The team is now actively preparing for the quarterly financial report and the earnings call. We expect to file on schedule and present a comprehensive update on FX’s latest progress during the call. In addition, FF was invited to attend the 3rd Annual Bahamas Summit, where our Global President Jerry Wang delivered an important presentation on FF and FX that received highly positive feedback. The FF team, together with the Qualigen team, also attended the ThinkEquity Conference held in New York City this week, meeting with over 30 investors and receiving broad attention from Wall Street and also the broader capital market. Going to S6 in the Middle East: We also officially announced that soccer superstar Andrés Iniesta has become the first global owner of the FX Super One and our Developer Co-Creation Officer. Further details on our deepened collaboration with Andrés will be announced soon. The renowned football media outlet FourFourTwo ranked Andrés third among the greatest football players of the 21st century, highlighting his historic influence. Our collaboration with Andrés reflects the trust and recognition of a global sports legend in FF’s company and products. A quick look at the Crypto Flywheel: This week, all businesses under the Crypto Flywheel made steady progress. In particular, our Middle East subsidiary received its first FX Super One deposit paid with cryptocurrency, further validating the tremendous value and energy of our Web2 + Web3 meta-chemistry, where both ecosystems empower and reinforce each other. Finally, on Issues, Reflections, and Solutions: Some stockholders have asked why the FX 4 rear design rendering was not shown at the October 28 launch event, as previously mentioned. Here’s the explanation: First, FX 4 is planned to make its debut in the U.S. market, so we decided to keep the Middle East launch focused on its core highlights and made corresponding content adjustments. Second, the overall timeline for FX 4 has been slightly shifted based on our latest strategic planning, and we plan to show its rear design rendering during the time period of the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, subject to securing the necessary agreements. We do look forward to sharing more updates at that time. And that’s all for today, I will see you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: Trump’s Industrial Policy: What’s Right and Wrong
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/11/02/trumps-industrial-policies-whats-right-and-wrong/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T23:25:19Z
Full Content:
In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.” In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring. Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it). So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use. This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse. Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far: U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants. MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder. Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay. Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government. Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding. Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out. 1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.” 2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies. 3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.” 4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants. Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals. 5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place). Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review. Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors. As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations. External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary. It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker. Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments. A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions. A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools. So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor. For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips. It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise. That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap. If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy. With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Liang Zaizhong, the son of China manufacturing billionaire Liang Wengen, resigned as chairman of Sany Heavy Equipment International effective Oct. 31, the Hong Kong-listed company said in an announcement on Friday. Sany Heavy Equipment International, whose products include port equipment, named Zhou Fugui, a long-time Sany Group executive, as new chairman. Sany Heavy Equipment International also said Qi Jian would step down from roles as vice chairman and executive director “to enhance the company’s corporate governance structure and strengthen the rotation mechanism of the strategic leadership team.” Qi will remain CEO; Liang Zaizhong will stay on as an executive director. The changes at the top come after Sany Heavy Equipment International’s shares gained more than 45% in the past 12 months; the company said on Oct. 30 net profit rose by 16% from a year earlier to 414 million yuan in the three months to September. Liang Wengen, 68, is the founder and former chairman of Shanghai- and Hong Kong-listed Sany Heavy Industry, a construction equipment maker which has thrived over the years from China’s building and infrastructure boom. China’s richest man in 2011, Liang Wengen currently holds a fortune worth $8.8 billion, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Son Liang Zaizong, 40, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer and management sciences from the University of Warwick. He received a master’s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in May 2014. Both father and son are board members at Sany Heavy Industry. Sany Heavy Industry just last week sold $1.7 billion of “H shares” that began trading at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 28 at HK$21.30; they closed at HK$23.38 on Friday. Sany Heavy Industry’s Shanghai-traded shares, known as “A shares,” have gained 21% in the past 12 months. The Changsha-headquartered company, a global competitor of Caterpillar and Deere, said on Thursday net profit in the three months to September rose by 48% to 1.9 billion yuan, on revenue that increased 10.7% to 21.2 billion yuan. Sany Heavy Industry is among a group of Chinese companies trading at mainland exchanges to successfully seek an additional listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, making the bourse one of the world’s most important for new offerings in 2025. Others include Contemporary Amperex Technology, better known as CATL, and Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls. Cornerstone investors in Sany Heavy Industry’s H share offering included Temasek, BlackRock, Infore Capital, Hillhouse and UBS Asset Management. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index has risen more than 27% in the past year. Sany’s history traces to China’s central Hunan province in 1989 as a small welding materials factory. Other Sany-connected billionaires include Xiang Wenbo ($1.4 billion), Mao Zhongwu ($1.3 billion) and Tang Xiuguo ($1.4 billion). Sany America, Sany Heavy Industry’s main U.S. operation, is headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia.

Title: The Case Against Quarterly Reporting By Public Companies– Part 1, The Fundamentals

ByGeorge Calhoun, Contributor. U.S. financial regulators will soon modify or rescind the 55-year old rule requiring public companies to issue formal financial reports every 90 days. Surveys of business leaders consistently reveal concerns about the cost and distraction of preparing and managing the short-cycle reporting process. They also provide evidence of a short-term bias in corporate decision-making, linked to the pressures of the current quarterly reporting cycle. There is an acknowledged tendency to sacrifice long-term strategic investments, alter accounting schedules, and incur other financial penalties (e.g., customer discounts for favorable purchase arrangements) in order to meet quarterly earnings targets. Meanwhile, academic and industry studies indicate that semiannual reporting does not impair, and may even improve, company performance, the functioning of financial markets, and the quality of financial information available to investors. Finally, the quarterly reporting regime has created a significant short-term disruption or distortion of trading patterns centered around the earnings announcement – dubbed the “Earnings Game” – characterized by abnormal volatility, evidence of mispricing and market anomalies or inefficiencies, an open door to market manipulation, and disadvantages for small investors in particular. In this Part 1, we will review the “big picture” arguments pro and con. In Part 2, the focus will be on the nature and consequences of the Earnings Game. The United States stands alone (almost) among advanced economies in requiring quarterly financial reports from all public companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the quarterly reporting requirement in 1970. It has evolved into a highly structured, closely regulated framework which defines how companies communicate with the financial markets. Other countries have experimented with the American model – and then abandoned it. The European Union mandated quarterly reporting in 2004, but rescinded the rule in 2013. British regulators instituted a quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 – and repealed it seven years later. Singapore was quarterly for 17 years until 2020. Japan’s experiment with full quarterly reporting ran from 2003 to 2024. (Only Canada still follows the American example.) The SEC has now indicated that it wants to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirement in favor of semiannual reports by late next year, with full implementation expected by 2028. It is of course controversial. The arguments both for and against the proposed change tend to focus on how reporting frequency might influence the way companies are managed or the way markets function. Both sides often rely on deductions from “theory,” or simple appeals to “obviousness” – rather than hard evidence, which is scarce (for reasons discussed below). In the following sections, we’ll state the case for each side and review the available evidence. The main argument for change is the claim that quarterly reporting encourages “short-termism” – a tendency for companies to sacrifice long-term growth and investment in favor of short-term measures aimed at boosting quarterly results. This was the rationale for ending mandatory quarterly reporting in the EU. The EU even sees a “problem” with companies that continue to issue quarterly reports voluntarily. Regulators are said to be considering “more draconian measures, including ways to discourage or ban listed companies from reporting on a quarterly basis” even when they are not required to do so. UK regulators followed the recommendations of the Kay Report (authored by the prominent economist John Kay), which defined short-termism as “a tendency to under-investment, whether in physical assets or in intangibles such as product development, employee skills and reputation with customers” and sought ways to “reduce the pressures for short-term decision making that arise from excessively frequent reporting of financial and investment performance (including quarterly reporting by companies).” American critics of “quarterly capitalism” have included Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton (who coined the phrase), and Joe Biden, who wrote in 2016 that – Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, and Warren Buffett have criticized the “short-termism that is harming the economy” driven by an “unhealthy focus on quarterly earnings.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blames “today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria” which is “totally contrary to the long-term approach we need.” David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, believes investors “can get adequate financial disclosure in two reporting cycles and it frees up both time and economic opportunity to really focus on the business and take a longer term view.” Norway abolished quarterly reporting in that country in 2017, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund ($1.8 Tn) has proposed eliminating quarterly reporting for all public companies everywhere, citing the “risk of companies prioritizing short-term profits and the meeting of analyst forecasts over long-term investment, value creation and sustainable development.” The former Chairman of Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, cited the problem of short-termism among investors: “Issuing three-monthly updates on corporate performance does not improve transparency but does encourage investors to take a damagingly short-term view of their equity holding.” The President of the New York Stock Exchange focused her comments on the “burdensome” cost of preparing and managing short-cycle financial reporting. So, too, Nasdaq – Many leaders of nonfinancial firms believe that eliminating this short-term bias would improve business operations. Unilever’s CEO said that after the company stopped issuing quarterly reports – The Vice-Chairman of General Motors concurred: “The search for quarterly earnings is the father of many, many bad product decisions.” In sum, advocates of less frequent reporting argue that the current quarterly cycle tends to distort business decision-making, and thereby harms investors. It may even constitute a “threat to America’s enduring prosperity” (to again quote former President Biden). Traditionalists in the financial establishment generally line up against the proposed change, and their opposition tends to be categorical. The Wall Street Journal called the proposal to abandon the quarterly reporting cycle “wrong in every possible way.” They dismiss the short-termism argument out of hand – “utter tosh”(again, The Wall Street Journal). The general success of American business, and strong equity market valuations, are reason enough to reject it. Robust capital spending is also seen as proof that short-termism is a myth. Advocates of the status quo are worried about the negative consequences of less frequent reporting. Their arguments are based on classical Finance Theory. For example, the stock market (in theory) aggregates vast quantities of information about each company – its assets, its performance, its prospects, its customers, its competitive position in its sector, its role in the global economy – to calculate the correct current price and value of the company’s shares. Prices serve as signals to direct the proper allocation of capital. More frequent updates must always be preferable… because… well, more information must be better than less information, right? “Less frequent reporting would lead to less information and riskier markets,” as well as “greater volatility in securities prices.” It would impair price discovery, and render markets less “efficient.” Distorted asset prices would cause capital misallocation and trigger a cascade of evils – Other consequences of eliminating quarterly reporting could include: In sum, opponents of change see the quarterly reporting cycle as a critical guard rail that, if removed, would alter the way markets work and the way public companies are managed, to the general detriment. Many of these arguments are conjectural. For example, I know of no way to measure “market discipline” or to empirically estimate “misallocation of capital” on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. Moreover, because all U.S. public companies have been required to report quarterly since 1970, there is no recent comparative data. Some studies have tried to reach back to find a point of reference before the rule change, in, say, the Eisenhower era. However, the economy is much changed since then, as are the accounting and tax rules, the technology base, the financial markets, and management practices. 70-year-old data is just too stale. In other countries, however, where quarterly reporting is no longer required, some companies still do report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. EU firms are currently divided more or less equally between quarterly and half-yearly reporters, which sets up a plausible A/B comparison. (We will look at some of this data below, but there is an important caveat. Decisions about reporting frequency are not random. Many confounding factors are involved, including company size, the behavior of peers in the same sector, seasonality of the business, and management style.) The UK provides another natural experiment. Prior to 2014, quarterly reporting was mandatory. Today, “almost all” UK companies report semiannually. This sets up an interesting Pre-Post test (although there are possibly important differences between the two time periods). All that said, and with the appropriate caveats – the non-U.S evidence supports a surprising conclusion: Analysts have compared quarterly and semiannual reporters in the EU and UK on the basis of: The only recent study of the effect of reporting frequency on fundamental business performance comes from Goldman Sachs. Analysts compared the business performance of quarterly reporters and semiannual reporters in the EU Stoxx 600 index, and found little difference in return on equity, average net profit margins, and earnings per share growth. On the central question of short-termism, one approach is to look at levels of capital expenditure. Long-term investments should draw down earnings and net cash flows in the short term. A short-term bias would show up as a lower level of such investment at quarterly reporters compared with firms which do not report as frequently. The UK offers a double test – first imposing a mandatory quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 and then removing it in 2014. A study for the CFA Institute found that when quarterly reporting was imposed in 2007 it “had no material impact on the investment decisions of UK public companies.” When the mandate was lifted seven years later – A 2023 “Pre-Post” comparison in the UK examined the effect of reporting frequency on the quality of accounting information included in financial reports. The result was “counterintuitive.” An earlier study (2010) looked at the quality of information from the investors’ perspective. The result was also contrary to theory-based expectations. The previously cited Goldman Sachs study found essentially no difference in the price-earnings ratios for quarterly vs semiannual reporting companies in the EU sample. A 2010 study assessed “share price informativeness” for quarterly and half-yearly reporters in several EU markets – a measure of pricing accuracy and market efficiency based on the speed with which share prices anticipate, capture and reflect new earnings information – the efficiency of the price discovery process. It was unaffected by reporting frequency. The same study looked at the surprise caused by the earnings announcement – conceptualized as the difference between investors’ earnings estimates and the actual results. It is measured by the level of abnormal volatility and trading volume on the announcement date. It turns out that earning surprises are not dampened by more frequent reporting. And – Surprise reflects a disconnect between investors’ expectations and reality as revealed in the earnings announcement. It can be seen as an indication of the degree of mispricing in the market ahead of the earnings date. By this measure, quarterly reporting is associated with greater mispricing prior to the earnings release than semiannual reporting. This is a powerful and important deduction from classical Finance Theory. It is likely true, to some degree, and is often repeated as an article of faith. It justifies the quarterly cycle (for advocates of the status quo). The evidence is sketchy at best. “Cost of capital” is typically modeled rather than measured directly. The models depend on a set of complex assumptions, some of which are highly questionable. (For example, the “weighted average cost of capital” that all MBA students learn to calculate assumes that “perfect capital markets exist.”) The issue can also seem to cut both ways. More frequent updates presumably reduce risk and lower the cost of capital for quarterly reporters. But if less frequent reporting is associated with higher quality financial information (as studies cited above show), that should also reduce uncertainty, reduce risk, and thereby reduce the cost of capital for semiannual reporters. One oft-cited study concludes simply that “the benefits of mandatory disclosures are likely to differ across firms.” It should also be remarked that if a company is topically concerned about its cost of capital – say, in connection with a forthcoming funding round – it can always release information on a more frequent basis voluntarily. (And of course, material events must always be disclosed by means of an 8-K filing.) Then there is the question of mindset, or bias. A survey of 400 Chief Financial Officers of U.S. public companies published in 2005 found that “a surprising 78% of the sample admits to sacrificing long-term value” in order to “smooth earnings.” Nearly 40% said they would give discounts to customers to accelerate future spending plans to increase the company’s reportable sales in the current quarter – forfeiting a percentage of revenue to buff up the 10-Q. The payoff is said to be predictability. At the very least, such measures muddy the quality of the information provided to investors, and may shade towards illegal manipulation. Earnings management and/or manipulation has been the subject of dozens of academic studies, with a variety of definitions and methodologies, so that estimates of the prevalence of these practices vary widely. But it seems clear that the pressure of quarterly reporting deadlines can warp managerial decisions in many cases. So, with regard to “short-termism” the evidence seems mixed. The UK accounting data say no, but survey results confirm a short-term bias among U.S. executives, which is significantly exacerbated by the earnings calendar. That said – after five decades, U.S. public company executives are by now fully habituated to the quarterly reporting cycle – and as opponents of change readily point out, American economic exceptionalism seems unimpaired. Compared to other countries, U.S. businesses are more profitable, the market values of U.S. public companies are higher, and U.S. strategic leadership in many sectors of the global economy (e.g., Tech, Finance, Pharma and Energy) is clear cut. It could be argued that somehow short-termism has served the U.S. economy very well. Perhaps it is an antidote for the complacency which otherwise tends to infect the management mindset in all large and successful organizations. So, short-term biases may exist, but do they matter? Does quarterly reporting help or harm the company and its investors? Would less frequent reporting impair market functioning? The hard evidence, such as it is, suggests that reporting frequency has very little effect, perhaps favoring semiannual reporting slightly. Ambiguity encourages both sides. The New York Times – which leans towards maintaining the status quo – summarized “numerous studies [that] found no discernible improvements in corporate planning or performance in countries where [less frequent reporting] has been tried” – implying no need for change. But a semantically equivalent rephrasing – “Numerous studies found no discernible difference in corporate planning or performance related to reporting frequency” – could equally well support the argument for joining the global consensus. And there may be very good reasons to do so. Quarterly capitalism has created what has come to be called the “Earnings Game”– where company managers, analysts, and investors maneuver for advantage in the turmoil before and after the official earnings release. It generates a characteristic distortion of the market, and a symbiotic distortion of management behavior. The quality of financial information is often compromised. Mispricings develop. Trading is abnormal and even chaotic. The participants are tempted to pursue quasi-adversarial and sometimes dysfunctional strategies, which open the door to market manipulation, inspire or reinforce short-termist biases in business decision-making, and increase the overall risk for investors. It is likely that retail investors in particular are disadvantaged, trading against professionals who have developed sophisticated techniques for exploiting the market anomalies created by the earnings game. Part 2 of this column will examine this game and its consequences, which make a stronger case for changing the current reporting cycle than the shallow theoretical arguments that have dominated the debate so far.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. After huge rallies or selloffs, it’s often pointed out that the stock market is not the economy, or that Wall Street is not Main Street. But that divide is getting blurrier. That’s because higher asset prices are spurring consumers to spend more freely than before, and consumption represents about 70% of GDP. In fact, this so-called wealth effect has become more potent in just the past 15 years. Today, every 1% increase in stock wealth translates to a 0.05% uptick in consumer spending, according to a note last week from Oxford Economics lead U.S. economist Bernard Yaros. In other words, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010. Meanwhile, every $1 increase in housing wealth leads to a $0.04 bump in consumption, up from $0.03. “As households see their wealth rise, they turn more sanguine about their personal financial situation and are more inclined to loosen their purse strings,” Yaros wrote. “Increases in wealth will also propel spending by allowing homeowners to extract more equity from their houses or to liquidate appreciated stocks to fund their current consumption.” He sees the wealth effect sending the marginal propensity to consume even higher in the coming years because retirees will comprise a bigger share of the population. Given that they already enjoy a bigger net worth than younger generations do, retirees will rely more on their wealth to support consumption after they stop working and earning an income, Yaros explained. On top of that, the ubiquity of digital media means consumer sentiment reacts even quicker to market news, reinforcing these wealth effects, he added. This more powerful wealth effect could help explain why consumer spending has stayed resilient. Even as President Donald Trump’s trade war has kept inflation sticky and made businesses more nervous about adding workers in an uncertain landscape, AI is still propelling the stock market to new record high after record high. At the same time, the stock market has grown more dependent on AI-related stocks, such as chip leader Nvidia along with so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google. Based on his wealth-to-spending math, Yaros estimated that stock market gains in the past 12 months from the tech sector alone will boost annual consumption by nearly $250 billion, which would account for more than 20% of the cumulative spending increase. “While the stock market is not the economy, the latter risks greater whiplash from the ups and downs in the former,” he wrote. Analysts at JPMorgan also looked at the the link between the AI boom and consumers in a note last month. They estimated U.S. households gained more than $5 trillion in wealth in the past year from 30 AI-linked stocks, raising their annualized level of spending by about $180 billion. That represents just 0.9% of total consumption, but JPMorgan noted that it could go higher if AI spurs gains in a broader array of stocks or in other assets like real estate. And stocks are not limited to wealthier Americans either. A survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. To be sure, the wealthiest still spend the most dollars, and the emerging K-shaped economy has magnified their impact. Research from Moody’s found that the top 10% of earners accounted for half of spending in the second quarter, a record high. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, attributed that to the wealth effect from stock and real estate gains as well as from income disparities. “Tying all this together produces two things—an economy increasingly reliant on discretionary spending among higher earners, and higher earners whose discretionary spending is reliant on risk assets remaining buoyant,” he said in a note on Tuesday. This dynamic means central bankers at the Fed who control monetary policy and lawmakers in Congress who control fiscal policy have a greater incentive to support the stock market, Brown added. That’s because the wealth effect can work in the reverse direction, meaning falling asset prices will slow spending and the economy. “What we have, then, is an economy that’s tied increasingly closely to the fortunes of the equity market, and an equity market that’s increasingly tied to overall consumer spending, which coupled together result in stronger ‘put’ structure to backstop risk assets, with fiscal stimulus continuing, and monetary backdrops becoming looser,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: I Tried Aldi's Diet Coke Copycat And It's Not Even Close To Everyone's Favorite Fridge Cig
URL: https://www.tastingtable.com/2013384/aldi-summit-diet-cola-diet-coke-copycat-review/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T18:20:00Z
Full Content:
As of 2025, Diet Coke reigns as the number one diet soda in the U.S., which doesn't surprise me at all. I will check and see if restaurants have Coke or Pepsi before I go. I'm that picky. And I'm not the only fan! Diet Coke ranks fifth among all top-selling sodas in general, coming in after regular Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Sprite, and Pepsi, in that order. And there are a lot of sodas out there! But recently, we heard a little rumor that there was a Diet Coke dupe that tasted even better and was cheaper, which had us more than intrigued. Personally, as a diehard Diet Coke fan, I have to say I was incredibly suspicious and needed to do my own investigating. (Those are some pretty big claims to be making.) The copycat — Aldi's Summit brand diet cola — is one of many dupes by this grocery store. Luckily, there is an Aldi very close to me, so I ran right out to grab a 12-pack. Already having Diet Coke on hand, because I use it in everything from mocktails and cocktails to baking sweet treats, it would be easy to do a head-to-head taste test. Giving each a 24-hour window to chill in my refrigerator, I sat down to taste them. I was ready for anything. I took a deep breath and opened my mind to the possibilities. Would it taste the same? Would it actually be better? Well, here's what I found. When working on this piece, Summit Diet Cola was available at my Aldi for $4.69 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans. There are over 2,500 Aldi locations scattered through 39 states in the U.S. So, the availability is somewhat accessible, although not as widely distributed as Diet Coke. As far as Diet Coke goes, at my local Kroger, there is always a BOGO sale going on, so I always stock up. The week I purchased these sodas, it was a buy two, get three free weekend sale. With a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans costing $10.99, that worked out to $4.39 per pack, which was an even better deal than Aldi. While Kroger only operates in 16 states and territories, I feel like there are other stores that probably offer similar discounts. When I checked out Walmart prices at the time of this writing, it had 24-packs of Diet Coke cans for $13.78, making a 12-pack $6.89. And Walmart does operate in all 50 states. Additionally, Costco (operating in 49 states and territories) had 35-packs of cans for $19.85, which would leave you paying around $6.60 per 12-pack. So, there are deals to be had if cost is an issue. I cracked open the chilled can of Summit Diet Cola and went in for my first taste. It had an immediate sweet cloud that covered my palate and filled my mouth. There was a nice carbonation about it that tingled my tongue and gave the soda an overall round, full profile. Oddly, there was an overly obvious citrus taste to it that reminded me of the lemon and lime flavor of Sprite, but with a touch of vanilla. It wasn't bad, just odd. But it couldn't garner too much attention, as the sweet flavor demanded center stage throughout. The sweetness tasted artificial and exceedingly apparent, like a small child vying for the spotlight. It carried the flavor in and stayed long after any citrus, spice, or carbonation was gone. And while it didn't go over the top or become offensive, it was still somehow larger than it needed to be. In the end, all the tastes stopped very abruptly, leaving the palate seemingly coated with a nothingness that wasn't entirely clean. This diet cola wasn't bad, but it was very obviously an off-brand, a generic interpretation of something familiar. I could taste what it was trying to achieve, but it tried too hard and missed the mark with its overzealous flavoring. Taking a sip of Diet Coke offered a layer of flavors and carbonation to cascade across my taste buds, dancing with tiny, prickling bubbles. There seemed to be a blanket of caramel that was soft, lush, and slightly sweet. Underneath the caramel was a hint of citrus that seemed to complement the spicy aesthetic without drawing too much attention to itself. The sweetness of it all seemed to be but a welcome guest of equal measure on the journey of flavors. Nothing tasted to stand out on its own; rather, every flavor worked together in harmony. The flavors of Diet Coke appeared to be deliberately refined, balanced on rich fizz that teased the taste buds into new heights of enjoyment. And when it left my mouth, the flavors and slight burn of carbonation lingered only for a moment before taking their final leave. Overall, refreshing and soft but strong, drinking Diet Coke was incredibly satisfying. I tasted both diet sodas over ice, one at a time. Then, I did the same straight from the can. To ensure I was comparing them as accurately as possible, I also went back and forth, taking sips side by side. The Summit Diet Cola had flavors that were audacious compared to Diet Coke. They went too far, became too artificial, and were too sweet. Instead of working together, the Summit Diet Cola came across as a battle for attention from one flavor to the next, while Diet Coke's flavor, carbonation, and sweetness all worked in tandem to complement and enhance each other's qualities. It would be one thing if rumors had said that this dupe was somewhat comparable. That I could see. Both sodas have a citrus component, an artificial sweetness, and a caramel aesthetic. However, Diet Coke remained subdued in all its flavors and maintained a refreshing quality that was enjoyable rather than complicated. Summit, on the other hand, was like a little kid dressing up in their parents' clothes, trying to be something it wasn't, and ending up as an obvious farce. Diet soda alternatives keep coming after Diet Coke. But I just don't believe that any of them will ever beat the OG. And why do we need them to? With the ability to get discounts or bulk amounts of Diet Coke, the savings are negligible. You just need to look around and see where you can find the best deal. To get the best taste, I feel it's more than worth it.

Title: Meta has an AI product problem  | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. Those figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous. The issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company’s operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started. “The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” If his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. It’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn’t clear what the money actually bought. Analysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta’s planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI. “There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we’re starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.” Meta isn’t the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it’s worth teasing out why this same spending isn’t spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta. There really are concerns that we’re creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta’s core business will let it ride things out better than most. But if you ask Sam Altman why he’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he’ll tell you he’s operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that’s a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions. Meta doesn’t have a product like that, and it’s not clear where it’s going to come from. The company’s most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it’s hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There’s also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that. The most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs. Put simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products. It’s telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg’s response wasn’t to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation. Zuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab’s new models, that he was very excited about new products. “It’s not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it.” But this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.” As the market response showed that answer is wearing thin. To be fair, it’s only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company’s AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn’t had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there’s still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry. Will Meta AI use the company’s detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta’s targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg’s references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play? So far, it’s anyone’s guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon.

Title: From Wild West to Wall Street: Crypto is boring now because ‘we won’

Once the Wild West of finance, crypto has matured into a Wall Street fixture with regulators and ETFs. We won. That’s why crypto is boring now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Remember when Crypto Twitter was like taking a front-row seat to the movies? Markets were a runaway rollercoaster, narratives flipped like pancakes, and every week had the energy of a new heist movie. What happened? If you’re lamenting the days of God candles and 20% BTC pumps, Nic Carter wants you to smile through the tears: crypto is boring now because we won. From major exchange collapses to China bans, Elon Musk pumps to COVID black swans, it’s been quite a ride. Jamie Dimon lambasted Bitcoin as a “fraud” and threatened to fire anyone caught trading it at JPMorgan. Now the world’s biggest banks are stacking stablecoins, and even Dimon admits, “Crypto is real. Stablecoins are real,” as JPMorgan invites clients to post BTC and ETH as collateral for loans and launches its own blockchain rails. Are all the crazy days behind us now, and crypto is boring? Is it time to seek a new asset class for our thrills? Turns out, Gandhi’s saying, “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,” might fit crypto better than anyone expected.​ At the heart of the vibe shift is what Nic Carter nailed in a post on X. The reason the volatility has dampened is because we won. As he states: “Crypto is boring because so many of the open questions have been answered.” Gone is the existential guessing game about whether stablecoins will be banned or if writing smart contracts will get you thrown in jail. The old school volatility, the kind that made fortunes and wiped them out by lunchtime, came straight from regulatory Russian roulette and the sense that rules might change at any moment.​ Now? The GENIUS Act pins down rules for stablecoins, the Clarity Act sets out bright lines for what is a security and what isn’t. And even the question of crypto’s marriage with TradFi is a historical footnote, not a juicy risk premium. When you live in a world where holding T-bills on-chain is business casual and BlackRock’s ETF isn’t controversial, that means dampened volatility. Which means that crypto is boring. Even as price action grinds along, what used to be wild opportunity now feels, to many, like a playground being turned into a parking lot.​ As BTC analyst Will Clemente commented: “The vibes in the crypto groupchats that I’m in are just sad honestly, people completely giving up and pivoting to other asset classes if they haven’t already.” But Carter isn’t mourning. As he sees it, regulatory clarity, Wall Street adoption, and boring stability are proof that crypto won. The whole space has matured. What was once a technological risk-fest is now a “technological substrate” adopted by the world’s biggest firms. The new game isn’t about skirting the law; it’s about building products that actually generate value in clear daylight.​ Wall Street didn’t just join the party; it put on the DJ headphones. BlackRock. JPMorgan. Even Jamie Dimon’s about-face is now crypto lore. From denier to builder, the old guard’s pivot closes the loop on a playbook that once prioritized chaos and rewarded pirates. Now, crypto is boring. TradFi’s seriousness brings real capital, real custody, and real infrastructure. The legends of the wild west are being replaced by compliance teams, pension allocators, and crash-helmeted bankers. And that’s all great… except some of us miss the outlaws.

Title: China tweets satellite photos of Taiwan's critical Hsinchu chip hub in pressure-ratcheting political stunt — 'where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,' highest concentration of chipmaking facilities in the world

A Chinese embassy post highlighting Hsinchu Science Park underscores rising geopolitical risks to the world’s most advanced chip supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. On Friday night, China’s embassy in Washington posted a familiar message to X: “There is but one China in the world.” But this time, the predictable rhetoric from China came with a glossy photo carousel that included a sweeping aerial shot of Hsinchu Science Park, the epicenter of the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. As analyst Patrick Moorhead highlighted in a response to the embassy’s post, Hsinchu includes TSMC’s Fabs 12A, 12B, 20, 3, 5, 8, 2 and the Advanced Backend Fab 1, all crammed into the park’s core, along with the company’s Global R&D Center, “where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,” he wrote, pointing out that chips for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and even Intel depends on this small square of land. There is but one #China in the world; #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is vibrant under the "Jilin-1" space satellite's perspective. 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳💧Sun Moon Lake 日月潭⛰Alishan 阿里山🏙Taipei City 台北市⚓️Taipei Port 台北港… pic.twitter.com/bOIvAdrSuyOctober 31, 2025 While the post didn’t mention chips directly, it didn’t have to. Hsinchu is home to TSMC’s original fabs, the headquarters of MediaTek and UMC, and key government agencies that oversee Taiwan’s space and chip strategy. There is no other place on Earth with the same concentration of cutting-edge logic process nodes. This is where the GPUs that train AI models begin, where desktop and server CPUs are etched, and where bleeding-edge silicon IP is designed. Expand the embedded tweet below to see the images. Let me be clearer. Here are the TSMC fabs currently in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan: Fab 12A/12B/20/3/5/8/2 and Advanced Backend Fab 1. Oh, and $TSM HQ and the “Global R&D Center” where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created to build all $NVDA, $AMD, $AVGO, $AAPL,… https://t.co/zpCTETPHKf pic.twitter.com/d0KiK19iYWNovember 1, 2025 This isn’t the first time that Beijing has tried to remind the world of Taiwan’s vulnerability. In recent months, Chinese naval forces have staged simulated blockades in the Taiwan Strait, inspecting commercial cargo ships and raising fears of a chokepoint disruption. The Trans-Pacific Express Cable System, which directly connects Taiwan to the U.S. East Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China, was damaged by a Cameroon-flagged freighter, Shunxing39, earlier this year, prompting Taiwan to increase legal penalties for damaging undersea cables. According to a recent special report from Reuters, U.S. officials have begun modeling worst-case scenarios for the Bashi Channel, a key shipping lane essential to Taiwanese exports like advanced wafers and electronics, in response to recent incursions. In September, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Taiwan’s chip sector the “single greatest point of failure for the world economy” because 99% of high-performance chips are manufactured there, and back in June 2021, a White House review warned that even a temporary hit to TSMC output could ripple through everything from datacenters to defense. China’s embassy didn’t need to mention any of that directly. A single photo of Hsinchu was enough at a moment while tensions remain high.

Title: 'Bitcoin's Silent IPO': Analyst Addresses BTC's Lame Price Action in Viral Weekend Essay
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/02/bitcoin-s-silent-ipo-analyst-addresses-btc-s-lame-price-action-in-viral-weekend-essay

It's not exactly news to frustrated bitcoin BTC$104,084.39 bulls that risk assets across the planet for months have been recording what seem like daily record highs while the price action in BTC remains rather muted. "What if everyone is looking at this wrong," asks longtime traditional finance asset manager Jordi Visser in a heavily shared (1.5M views on X and counting) weekend essay titled "Bitcoin’s Silent IPO: Why This Consolidation Isn’t What You Think." While bitcoin never had a traditional IPO, the factors liming price gains are nearly exactly the same as those which cause poor price performance in stock IPOs, argues Visser. Tradfi IPOs and the months that follow, reminds Visser — particularly in tech — are major liquidity events for early investors. "Early-stage investors take enormous risks," wrote Visser. "If the investment succeeds, they deserve enormous rewards. But eventually, and this is crucial, they need to realize those gains. They need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify." The examples, particularly in tech, are legion, but consider the Facebook (now Meta) IPO of 2012. The offering at $38 per share raised $16 billion at a valuation of $104 billion — quaint numbers today, but staggering amounts at the time. One year later, the stock was 30% lower, with pundits questioning Mark Zuckerberg's leadership. More likely than missteps by Zuck, it was early investors — be they his Harvard buddies, or Silicon Valley types, or the carpenters who framed out Facebook's first offices (who took pay in shares rather than cash) — using public markets to realize life-changing profits. Importantly, says Visser, the early investors don't hit the bid all at once. "They’re methodically distributing their positions. They’re being careful. They don’t want to crater the price. They’re patient. They’ve waited years for this moment. They can wait a few more months to do it right." The result, he says: "A sideways grind that drives everyone crazy." Sound familiar? "The on-chain data tells a clear story if you know how to read it," says Visser, turning to bitcoin. "Old coins, coins that haven’t moved in years, some dormant since the single-digit price days, are suddenly active." The ETFs, the institutional adoption, the friendly regulatory environment ... this created IPO-like conditions for bitcoin's early believers. "For years, the liquidity simply didn’t exist," he wrote. "Try selling $100 million of bitcoin in 2015. You’d crater the price. Try selling $1 billion in 2019. Same problem. The market couldn’t absorb it." "But now," he continued. "ETFs are providing institutional bid. Major companies hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds are getting involved. The market has finally matured to the point where early holders can exit significant positions without causing chaos." Again, reminds Visser, it's not being done all at once — no one is interested in crashing the price. But instead, steadily and methodically: hence the sideways grind and the rallies that reverse so quickly. What's occurring now is hardly anything that can be called a bear market, says Visser, but instead a distribution of ownership. Over the long run, this is a bullish event, but the process — at least in traditional markets — can take 6-18 months. Even though cycles often get sped up in crypto, Visser suspects there could be many more months of this frustrating price action in bitcoin. "Sentiment will only improve after the distribution is substantially complete," he wrote. "People are demoralized because they don’t understand what phase we’re in. They’re waiting for bitcoin to 'catch up' to stocks. They are worried about the four year cycle. Be patient. Once the heavy selling pressure lifts, once the patient accumulation by institutions has absorbed the OG supply, the path becomes clearer."

Tech firms will likely command the spotlight during this week’s earnings calendar, though pharmaceuticals and gig economy providers are also likely to be in focus. Artificial intelligence demand will be top of mind for market watchers when chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Arm Holdings, as well as software provider Palantir, report earnings this week. Results from pharmaceutical firms come amid pressure from the Trump administration to lower prices. Market watchers are likely to pore over private-sector jobs data for October in the absence of the originally scheduled U.S. employment report, which is likely to be delayed again as the government shutdown enters its second month. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Advanced Micro Devices will report on Tuesday, and investors will likely want to hear more about recent deals like the one signed in October to supply AI chips to Oracle. Other chipmakers are on the corporate earnings calendar this week, including Qualcomm, which last week unveiled two new AI chips for data centers. Chip designer Arm Holdings is also scheduled to report this week. In other tech-related reports, Palantir’s earnings on Monday come as the software maker’s shares have more than doubled this year on strong demand for its AI platforms. Cloud network provider Arista Networks is also on the calendar on Tuesday. Novo Nordisk reports on Wednesday, and the maker of Ozempic faces pressure from President Donald Trump over the costs of the weight loss treatment, which he said should run about $150 a month instead of the more than $1,000 it costs now. Other noteworthy pharmaceutical firms to report this week include Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, and they come as firms have made deals to lower drug prices in response to Trump's threat of hefty pharmaceutical tariffs. Several key firms in the so-called “gig economy” are also expected to report this week, including ride-sharing app Uber, food delivery service DoorDash, and property-rental app Airbnb. While the Federal Reserve has raised worries over the health of the labor market, the government shutdown is again expected to keep officials guessing over employment levels in the U.S. Originally scheduled for Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report for October is expected to be delayed due to the work stoppage. It would be the second straight monthly jobs report delayed due to the shutdown, which is entering its second month. Data on factor orders, the U.S. trade balance, and job openings are also likely to be delayed due to the shutdown. Market watchers won’t be totally in the dark when it comes to jobs in the U.S., as the private-sector ADP employment report remains scheduled for release on Wednesday. The closely followed ISM surveys on the manufacturing and services sectors are also scheduled this week, giving investors some indications on employment and pricing in those sectors. The Fed’s report on consumer credit and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are also expected this week. Remarks from Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, and New York Fed President John Williams will also be of note after the central bank last week cut interest rates for the second time this year. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Read Investopedia’s Latest News Monday, Nov. 3 Tuesday, Nov. 4 Wednesday, Nov. 5 Thursday, Nov. 6 Friday, Nov. 7 The Federal Reserve again cut interest rates last week, potentially leading to reductions in the rates that banks and credit unions pay on high-yield savings account deposits. Investopedia's Sabrina Karl has tips on how savvy savers can lock in better rates for months or years to come.

I don’t know why people become serial killers nor do I even care. I only know what should be done with them – and with extreme prejudice. “Why are we obsessed with serial killers?” Maybe because the killer in me is the killer in you…. Disarm, by Billy Corgan So I’ve watched a few of these series below on the central villain, and there is overlap of a kind, like deciphering whether the cult leader( ie, Jeffs ) or the serial killer is actually the worse and more effective evil. Exerting control seems to be a recurring theme. – Jeffrey Dahmer – Warren Jeffs and the FLDS cult ( polygamy ) – Ted Bundy – John Wayne Gacy – Zodiac These are all dark, and highly disturbing. I include the last entry since per the film, released in 2007 and possibly overlooked then, the alleged murderer was never actually caught or arrested for his crimes. My conclusion…some people are just not wired correctly from the get to. I actually have been a little curious about what the big deal is. Where I live, gang members have tens of bodies under their belts. There’re also a whole host of famous people who should be called serial killers but aren’t, like Obama. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that they lack individual notoriety for their crimes, for one reason or the other. The article doesn’t address this at all, unless I missed it and I would agree that the author’s reported curiousity may be less ubiquitous than they believe. It seems to me like the fascination with learning how other persons met with a miserable end is a phenomenom driven by news outlets (traditional and novel) hyping up particularly unique cases as a relatively easy sell for views/clicks etc.. The difference in the treatment is just stark. My news is always filled with the more prolific of the twenty or so deaths over the last week, sometimes barely afforded a paragraph because it’s the same old story over and over. Even when bodies do get found in pieces it’s not particularly earth-shattering. As far as I can tell, it seems to be that having a hundred known victims can never live up to the hype of leaving three of four bodies in sculpted positions. ‘Slasher’ enthusiasts, I’m sure, hardly care to learn how Joe went from selling his body for food to doing his part, keeping morticians securely employed. Mass murderers, spree killers, serial killers are categories, but I guess the category closest to covering officially protected perps would be something like “state sponsorsed terrorism”. US media is obsessed with serial killers (‘we’ means them), because shocking content attracts audience. It’s softcore atrocity porn. A polarizing film but one I think captured this well was Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers”. It’s too graphic and psychedelic for some but the way it portrays the media hype and popular fandom around a duo of serial killers was phenomenal in my opinion. Takes the old adage of “If it bleeds, it leads” and turned the dial up to eleven to critique the 90’s era tabloid news like Hard Copy. Not sure if there are any modern equivalents but to me that film still holds up and remains relevant. In an awful comparison, serial killers are tantamount to aces in that you need 5 kills to establish yourself as such. Note to gun nuts intent on doing your worst: Any outcome in the single-digits is pretty much yeah whatever as far as Presstidigitation is concerned. It might not even make the front page of the internet-such is fate. By serial killers, do they mean social murders? Kills more people than any serial killer ever has. On the AI front, this below in today’s FT reporting the same thing that commenter Rasperry Jam has been saying, that much of AI’s immediate future is in specialized foundation models using proprietary data. . No archived link yet — https://www.ft.com/content/91002071-7874-4cb7-9245-08ca0571c408 The new hot job in AI: forward-deployed engineers OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere have stepped up hiring for specialists to help businesses adopt their AI models ‘…Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere are recruiting for so-called forward-deployed engineers, a new job for generative AI companies, as part of a push to generate more revenues by installing specialists within businesses to help them customise their AI models…. ‘…The move comes as businesses across industries from manufacturing to healthcare are increasingly keen to adopt AI tools, but are often unsure how to use the technology and generate a return on investment. “A Fortune 500 bank has completely different needs than a start-up building an AI-native product,” said Cat de Jong, head of applied AI at Anthropic …. ‘While FDEs (forward-deployed engineers) represent a relatively small number of AI groups’ workforce, OpenAI said demand for these roles has exceeded its expectations. ‘The group used this approach to customise its technology for John Deere, an agricultural machinery manufacturer, to help create more precise farming tools. This resulted in farmers reducing chemical spraying by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. ‘OpenAI’s Fournier said: “We learn what customers in different industries really need, we experiment and innovate together, and then those insights help advance OpenAI’s research and product offerings based on what works in the real world.” Me: This is AI coming for McKinsey, Bain, and the like. i.e. Customers used to contract with a management consultancy firm, which then outourced a majority of work to an IT consultancy firm (ITF) that in turn might do 90% of work for 10% of contract value and the MCF took the rest. Any true value lay in which ITF the management consultant firm had the nous to choose. With AI, the ITF — in this case, OpenAI, Anthropic, whichever– disintermediates McKinsey etc. and assigns their role to its own forward development engineers. So if those forward-deployed engineers are working with a Fortune 500 bank or a corporation like John Deere to tailor those AIs to them individually, would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Yup. One thought, suppose there are better, more efficient AI models than Anthropic or Claude, buying into solution before problem…. Don’t rule out consulting yet. How about small language modules? Open labs* are raining small language models right now, some under 1B parameters, which is small enough to work (with patience) on any laptop. Most recently, LiquidAI published open-weight small models specialized for retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, information extraction, and mathematics. There has been a lot of recent work in vision and OCR surfacing recently as well. Small models are becoming more capable and efficient not only to encode or translate the text of a page or sign or describe a photo, but correctly read and reproduce sparse tables or describe the actions occurring between two video frames (with bounding boxes). * By open labs I mean those whose corporate future is not dependent on a world where all inference is centralized in a proprietary cloud, and who are not so motivated to hoard their IP or models. OpenAI and Anthropic, contrariwise, are worthless unless they can force the Western world to channel all its mechanical language processing through their machines and their meters. I think of OpenAI and Anthropic much like Uber, as regulatory plays intending to construct a regulatory environment in which the highly moderated service they offer is socially necessary, and alternatives are rendered illegal, unmerchantable, or impossible. Reminder that the “anti”-AI movement is only a shaping operation in the larger war against local computation, and, being mainly funded and operated by US AI services majors, national security goons, and washed-up pundits trying to uphold a lifestyle, should only ever be held with the same absolute suspicion and cynical hostility as any other corporate astroturf. The myth is not entirely wrong for some health conditions. My mother-in-law had polio as an infant. At some point in her seventies and eighties she (and the medical profession discovered that her muscles only had so many contractions in them and that the exercises she had been doing to maintain her strength were weakening her. would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Typically legal agreements are signed between the model provider and the company purchasing the services that the purchaser’s proprietary data, code, trade-protected processes – anything that falls under IP – remains under the control of the purchaser and is not the property of the model provider. What this means in practice is more nuanced: these companies are hiring the FDE’s as part of a service to create fine-tuned models trained on the customer’s data and processes, for exclusive use by the purchasing company. I’ve worked on projects like this for my company; we didn’t have access to the customer’s IP directly. What we did was brought in the trainer application(s), taught the purchasing customer how to train their model, and provided guidance on how to configure, evaluate and deploy it after it was complete. We also taught them how to prompt/interact with the models based on what they were trying to do. We – and likely these other model providers – provide the purchasing company with the model trainer because taking the customer’s IP out of their network is a) probably too much data, I’m talking in excess of 50 terabytes b) no company’s security team is going to sign off on that no matter how lucrative/cool the end use case will be. So no, they probably aren’t taking the customer’s IP and sending it back to the primary frontier models for training in the way you are describing. They’re making a smaller version of the frontier model trained on the customer’s IP, for the customer’s exclusive use. The FDE are running the training and internal education projects. Sounds like Lean Six Sigma “black belts”. Maybe if Toyota did AI….. Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” They don’t work solo, they are always paired with an “echo” team member (sometimes called a deployment strategist) who is the business/pm/person who interfaces directly with the customer technical and business leads. The FDE takes their orders from the DS; the customer yells at/makes demands of the DS. The DS is responsible for initial technical requirements gathering and “phoning home” to the company when business facets change (expansion, contraction, new opportunities, etc). They aren’t there to fully alter the purchasing customer’s business processes but to help the customer achieve their goals with their purchase of the AI services. So it is more of an on-site service partnership than an outside consultant. I lead the deployment strategist team at my company. The “forwards deployed” vocabulary is very militaristic. This strategy of embedding technical staff in the client on an open-ended consulting / brain-siphoning engagement is held up as the secret of Palantir’s “success”. I wonder if the buzzword comes from them too…. Anyway, we’re doing exactly this with our AI Fintech, building a very niche model and, yes, hiring forward deployed engineers for its deployment. Hell’s bells, those photos of the ultra-refined pizza(s) are ridiculous. As every Italian knows, pizza is its own food group, but there are rules. (Although in the Undisclosed Region the use of ingredients and doughs has some jazz-like variations, given that pizza is an exotic import from Naples and not original to the Chocolate City.) Lobster and caviar defeat the purpose of pizza, which is as a comfort food that doesn’t have too much meat or fish on top. It is the dough that matters. Second, I am seeing two other pizzas that aren’t pizzas. I’m not sure what the photos represent. They seem to be of a taco masquerading as a pizza — pieces of burnt sausage with raw lettuce, raw tomatoes, and sliced pickles? Or is this pizzaoidal object a discreet reference to Donald Trump’s eating habits? So these gold-foiled pizzas with pickles are a long way from a real pizza — which reaches the splendor of pizza when topped with cheese and squash blossoms. Or one of those jazzy Piedmontese variations (served at my Undisclosed Favorite Pizzeria): sauce of porcini, topped with porcini and a delicate Piedmontese cheese that is softer and a tad more savory than mozzarella. (Not that I’m complaining about mozzarella!) Heck, why waste a sturgeon’s time like this? PS: From Renato Viola’s home page, I discover that he has decamped to Miami, South Beach. Sic transit gloria pizzae. Thank you! I second that it’s the dough/crust first and foremost. I enjoy anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) from time to time, and have even once made a lobster pizza (it was tasty!), but these are not what I crave when I’m craving pizza. The State of Maine pizza, bacon and onion, is one of my favorites. mrsyk: anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) Anchovies are an object of veneration in the Undisclosed Region — especially the big anchovies from Spain or Sicily. So I understand your weaknesses. Once at my son’s urging we did a lobster fried rice as he said St Tony Bourdain had it. We did it without my wife present (the chef, the boss). It was good. Later my son said he made it up about Tony. There is a fancier Chinese restaurant nearby that makes a lobster fried rice and it’s delicious! They also do a nice dim sum lobster rangoon. I wouldn’t do lobster on a pizza [or mashed potatoes(!), looking at you Barstool-reviewed local Maine pizza place that is otherwise very good], but I find that substituting real lobster for the generally faux crabmeat in Asian cuisine is a nice touch. Horrible faux crabmeat is a nasty substitution for… real crab. Up here, on the BC Coast, the real thing is thankfully far more common — fake crab is extremely rare in Chinese restaurants, much more common in bad or mediocre Japanese restaurants, the latter often having both California Rolls and California Rolls with Real Crab on the menu. Saladizzas? Note ingredients seem to have been added after the pizza is done. Weird. I myself have done some weird dishes as I sometimes tried to be creative with mixed results. Paella madrás comes to mind. That one was edible and quite a thing though I have not tried twice. With time my “creativity” has mostly gone and now I stick most of the time with traditional recipes even if some are new to me. No garlic in the Spanish omelette then? (I’m torn on this one.) Onion, onion! And you can do it “campera” (country-side) with added pepper and chorizo. One bite, everybody knows the rules! In our town we used to have a pizza place called the Pizza Research Institute (PRI) that had the most unusual pizza toppings I’ve ever encountered. Many of my friends raved about it but as a half-Sicilian pizza traditionalist I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to try them. Unfortunately I really did like their pizza (except anything with Gorgonzola, a cheese apparently made from someone’s very dirty underwear). Example: the 3-P ….. pear, potato, and pesto. I know, I know…but it was brilliant. Laughingsong: Sicilian pizza (which is not sfinciune, which is wonderful) is what we in Chicago used to call the pizza of risen dough with much tomato sauce and very little cheese. You’d buy it buy the rectangle at certain bakeries. Oh, no, I feel Proust’s pizza calling… Note on sfinciune: I bought a slice of sfinciune at a nice grocery store in Palermo. It was ambrosial. Cheesy, plus a topping of gratinata, lots of breadcrumbs. Give it a try. Pear, potato, and pesto. The problem is that the pear’s elegant sweetness competes with the pesto’s wonderful perfume. The umami of the potato can’t rescue that threesome. That’s one of the dangers of threesomes. Now: Here in the Undisclosed Region you’d get potato, pesto, and hazelnuts (another object of veneration) or walnuts. Yumliziosa. Yeah, I dunno what any of that is. I did a Neapolitan style 10.5″ last night with a pizza oven, cooked up in about 2 minutes, starts to seriously burn at that point actually. Amazingly puffy but thin crust, overnight yeasted dough, just 00 flour, yeast, water, a bit of salt, and 1/8″ teaspoon of olive oil and a bit of amylase. Pesto, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. Best thing ever. Call me a pizza pedestrian, but I prefer mine Montreal style (with the cheese on top) with salty meat toppings — never any vegetables. About “Entrepreneurship in Europe: Where are firms thriving and barely surviving? ” As far as I can tell what the data shows is mostly about how easy and cheap it is to set up and close down shell-companies. I.e. financial shenanigans that on balance is probably damaging both economy and lives. I did not see any reference to that being part of the explanation, either the author is blissfully unaware of that or the author is aware and decided not to include it anywhere in the article. Might be a combination of unaware and being slightly aware but digging into it and writing about it might not be good for career and social prospects. “Opinion: Why Trump’s talk about nuclear testing is dangerous” I’m thinking that it was defensive here. The Russians had just announced the successful testing of their nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik. This was followed up by the successful testing of their nuclear-powered torpedo, the Poseidon. For the Neocons, this was bad news. It is one thing setting countries on fire in the Middle east or Africa or South America. They told themselves that they were safe as they had an ocean on each side, Arctic wastes to the north and a narrow peninsular to the south. With these new weapons that obsolete belief is dead. Trump had to throw up a distraction so that people would forget those new Russian weapons so came up with nuclear testing and it has worked. Only thing is whether Trump boxes himself in and is forced to conduct a nuclear test in a year or two from now because of all his belligerent boasting. It was another childish gesture. (Mine’s bigger than yours.) Quotidian Trumpian bravado. It’s not easy being a narcissist. My best guess is he doesn’t know the difference between nuclear powered and nuclear armed. I read someone point out trumps testing talk came just after his TACO with China. It’s round 10 million of SQUIRREL Nuclear testing is under the energy department, not the military. It would take probably years to put together the entire nuclear test program again before a single test could be completed. Historians will look back on 2025 as the US empire’s Suez year, with not just China’s successful pushback against US efforts to stop its rise but also Russia’s crushing of the Ukraine regime and the US-NATO proxy effort to regime change Russia. But, yes: 2030, if the Chinese perform a landing on Luna, is when this change will finally be absorbed by the mass of Americans. Those in DC will likely be the last to face the facts. Here’s The Duran weighing in on this, and I have the same concerns: Poseidon and Trump nuclear testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugtS1clYjEI Plus, they also discuss the myth that Reagan “won” the Cold War with an arms race, and yes, it’s a myth. I don’t know the details of what brought the USSR down, but I dare say that having old, out of touch, corrupt leadership class that caused great internal disarray was a much greater reason for the USSR’s collapse. (And I see parallels in America’s leadership today, bummer that!) Nexperia allowed to resume exports from China following Trump-Xi talks — companies may seek exemptions from the Ministry of Commerce to restart international deliveries Tom’s Hardware It appears that the USA’s famously brilliant negotiator of a president may not have understood what he agreed to with regard to Nexperia in his recent discussions with Xi. Per Arnaud Bertrand, the main value added by Nexperia NL to the supply chain of chips used in the auto industry is the production of the silicon wafers. Nexperia CN has now re-sourced those wafers domestically, which will leave Nexperia NL to wither away and the American and European auto producers even more dependent on China. Good job, wheeler-dealer Don. There are still propaganda pieces in the Netherlands that Karremans did a great and heroic thing in stealing Nexperia. I always knew that the Dutch press was mostly propaganda, but sometimes it is still a surprise for me when they lie about something. There is a bus-sized hole in that agreement in that China made no commitment to actually approve shipments to Nexperia. In the case of rare earth exports, despite a commitment to resume shipments back in April, very few were approved over the next months. so I scrolled through news sites….no mention of the World Series, lmao. (the secular, structural decline of baseball is another topic). Society/mass culture has become, essentially, circles of “fandoms”—politics, sports, celebrity news, baking, widget-collecting, etc. There is no more universal (national) cultural glue holding society together (except, a John Carpenter-esque: consume!) pretty wild that we live in an age where almost every First Worlder has a supercomputer in their pocket, and people have siloed themself into their own world with their own IV drip of info. it’s like a scene from “Wall-E” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk The only hint of violence on the diamond sputtered out during an ad hoc 7th inning stretch yesterday, but it was more of an Elks Club get together with no rabbit punches or fisticuffs to report and both teams dutifully went back to their respective dugouts… In comparison, I cringe about 6.3x a game during an NFL get together-when violence on the gridiron seems almost like a gut punch to watch. A lot of the skills are similar, throwing, running, catching and hitting-with a different variant on the latter. That was a World Series for the ages-one astounding play on the field after another, and I had mentally consigned myself to being on the losing side of an epic battle fought over 90 feet at a time in the 9th inning, satisfied in that i’d witnessed something special-and then redeemed by home run heroics by the least likely guy on the rosters to clear the fence. p,s, money, money, money dept: Disney owned the Angels around the turn of the century, and in their wisdom decided to trash all of the older players contracts, which were dutifully retrieved by a dumpster diver, and then sold to a coin dealer in Orange County. The ‘money’ one was Nolan Ryan’s yearly contracts, of which there were about 10 or so, and Nolan didn’t make jack, $27k. I must’ve read through hundreds of player contracts, got a little dull after awhile ah ha The internet has everything! Here’s the 1972 Nolan Ryan contract, and oh so plain Jane~ It fetched $6k in 2012 @ auction https://collectrea.com/archives/2012/Spring/767/1972-nolan-ryan-signed-california-angels-contract-first-american-league-contract On Nolan Ryan, when I worked at corporate HQ office of a local retail bank in Plano, Texas, circa 2011 to early 2012 my immediate manager was a Texas Rangers. Centered on the front wall of his office and opposite his desk was the timeless portrait of Ryan giving the business to an unfortunate Robin Ventura. Apparently there was disagreement on the high heat coming out of his right arm…. Always a shame that Ryan wasn’t gifted better team ownership or good franchise circumstances once he left the NY Mets; ok I guess the Astros had some years in the early to mid 80s after all. But for Ryan….No Cy Young award, but all them no hitters! It’s a new age, and it’s filled with football (of the international variety). Go check out an MLS game … Portland vs San Diego was absolutely electric last night. Fans singing, smoke flying, drums drumming, banners waving, stands bouncing. It is it’s OWN culture, and it’s international. Black, white, brown … every nation in the world represented. It’s called “the beautiful game” for a reason, and the beauty extends beyond the pitch. Maybe nobody’s talking about it because they can’t bear to admit that capitalism’s favorite team came out on top. I do like the individual Dodger players, and Ohtani especially is a pleasure to watch. And I do thank LA for taking a bunch of bunch of past their prime players with bloated contracts off the Red Sox’ hands several years ago. But LA is second only to the hated Yankees for teams I actively root against. It’s a team only PE C-suiters could love. Must be nice to bring in a billion dollars worth of pitchers for the last few weeks of the regular season and the p(l)ayoffs. Not every team has that luxury. Any mention of the Dodgers at NC should go under the guillotine watch. I dunno, fell under the spell of Dodger Stadium-the only 1960’s NL baseball stadium still left standing-and unlike most of the other 60’s efforts in that regard, didn’t have the awful dual MLB/NFL thing going on. Haven’t been to a game there this century, so i’m a little rusty-but oh the memories they linger pleasantly enough. From what i’ve seen on tv, the aged edifice looks to have more advertising than I remember seeing, but I’m from the era when trying to make money on such things was considered crass-so it was scant. The only indication @ Dodger Stadium was a big Union 76 orange ball on top of a pillar, so clean. Watched a NHL game from the 70’s awhile back and the boards are bereft of branding, naked as it were-they almost looked whitewashed in fact. Other than the link above?

I can only imagine the panic in the Trump regime as the Chinese get closer and closer to their objective but it is not like they are doing anything about this goal themselves. There is no permanent head of NASA and the guy at SecTransport is acting head – while muttering about how NASA should be folded into the Department of Transport. And he has thrown contracts open again meaning that there is no clear set path to launch a Moon flight but competing corporations who probably have their own ideas how things should be done. But no doubt that Trump will stick to his demand that there be an American on the Moon before the end of his term. It’s a good thing that JFK never said that but only that it be before the end of the decade. “‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache” What does “productivity” even mean when applied to a parasitic rent-seeking sector? The article actually addresses this but then turns away. One cannot stare into the sun! Of talks about how the historic UK productivity figures were driven by the productivity of the City and it has now cratered and brought the productivity figures down with it. I would like to see an analysis but I wonder if the current low measured productivity is actually any lower than before in many sectors (services), when finance is stripped out. The real new productivity crisis in the UK is in manufacturing as a result of higher energy and commodity costs because of war on Russia. And possibly the explosion of low wage jobs using the boom in legal economic migration (and the no wage jobs using illegal migrants). time change sucks if yer already insomniac and yer vertebrae wake you at 230am. anyhoo..this made the dog and catpile jump up off of me and flee: https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1984812876398485824 ‘This one is more accurate…😂’ https://xcancel.com/FPSPredatorsHA/status/1984849553355628689#m In a nutshell…, lol. I’m pretty thankful for the dog and catpile these nights. The fur-ball foursome got btus to spare. yeah…before it was just Osa the dog, and Bob the Cat(who has always been kind of a dick)…but the 3 juvenile cats that were friendly to me at the bar…i brought them into the house while i went on my catmurder spree. and they have become fixtures…much more cuddly than Bob ever was(he hates them,lol)so i have Bob behind my head in the pillownest, Osa along my right thigh, and 3 little cats piled up on my legs. makes it hard to get up for coffee in the am. or to tend the woodstoves, etc. but they are a welcome source of heat…and pretty good company, so far…galloping alongside me back and forth as i go about my doins. theyve also apparently inspired Osa to follow me around more. she likes them, wants to play, etc…but they’re wary,lol. and this sorta cold am(for me,lol-, was the first time she didnt growl when one of them slipped off my legs and nuzzled against her. still…a warm woman would be preferable… Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth ScienceDaily Scientists just discovered something that runners and cyclists knew all along. Even amateurs know that measuring pulse after waking up is how one can gauge change over time, and that it gets lower as you get in shape. These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it. LOL, Trump science. Believe it or not, that was the first guy on the Moon’s thoughts, too. I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats… and I don’t intend to waste any of mine. Neil Armstrong That’s why he took one small step in stead of one giant leap. Another example of why someone being an expert in one thing does not translate to them knowing jack about anything else. Yet, for some reason there’s no end to the various celebrities opining on important topics, tech oligarchs getting the grubby mits on everything, and me here in the comments sharing my opinion on stuff I clearly know nothing about. …got the extended warranty on heartbeats 100 billion, or 100 years-whatever comes first. And here I’ve been thinking I only had a set number of heart beats allowed per day and exceeding that number would be instant death. Guess I no longer have that excuse to not exercise! Why Do Spiders Decorate Their Webs? A New Piece of the Puzzle Nautilus ~~~~~~~~~~~ I find black widow webs to be the most fascinating, almost looks as if the 8 legged one was on an acid trip during construction of. So intricate and chaotic-but with a purpose. Then there was the time NASA fed various psychotropics to spiders and photographed the results. See: https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/nasa-spiders-drugs-experiment/ Here’s a video that introduced me to that research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoZhM0E8Ow I work in this area and this is my experience. Large companies (and some not so large) are extremely paranoid about allowing the AI companies to use their vital information for training. The major AI players all sell private instances where users are assured that no one outside of their company can use their data for training or analyze the custom models. They put language in contracts and audits are conducted by 3rd parties to verify these claims. Its above my pay grade to determine what they are really doing behind the scenes, but given the way the contracts are written it would be a major scandal if they ever got caught cheating. A big worry to many is the user sending private information to the models running in public instances which do not have these guarantees. My employer blocks these sites, and we’re all told to use the private version. A second worry that is coming on strong is the use of Chinese models like DeepSeek and Qwen (even privately maintained versions using open source) . More companies are adopting policies where these are forbidden because, I assume, the Chinese cannot be trusted. One company described it as “geopolitical models are forbidden”. Re: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth This is not new. back in the 70’s a friend gave me the “using up extra heartbeats” thing and I pointed out that: 3 mile run at 160 beats per min 160*20 = 3200 beats warm up cool down and other activity 120 beats per min 120*40 = 4800 beats resting pulse 50 for the rest of the day 23*60*50 = 69000 beats total 3200 + 4800 +69000 = 77000 beats per day him resting pulse 72*24*60 = 103689 beats per day (this assumes that during every day activity, his pulse is the same amount above resting pulse as mine) he started taking the stairs yeah this is some seriously auld news. It’s good to get it out there anyway as lots of the kids these days are all weights and no cardio. All weights and no cardio is also auld news, and no legs day too. ‘Massimo @Rainmaker1973 Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school.’ If those kids are doing a 12 hour day, then this is a vital necessity. I really like the way those desks converted into beds and they could teach the airlines a few tricks. You can see that there are multiple models here in use. And after those kids have their nap, they are ready to absorb more lessons. Of course if you read the replies to this tweet, you will find many sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1983685284827918711 I particularly liked the cabinets that had a whole bed hidden inside!! I could see a big market and lot of people making use of them. Homeless facilities, detention centers, airbnbs, Americans just trying to survive they’re inequality… Also, how is the United States education system going to compete with China? 12 hours of instruction a day! (Minus naps) I think car makers might be wise to incorporate some of the design implemented in the Chinese school desks to enable cars to become mobile homes … of a sort. Even dead cars could provide a home for the growing hordes of homeless. I have mixed feelings about 12 hours per day of instruction for school children. I learned the most from my own studies after I came home from school and from the time I spent at the public library and in my room attempting to write the most convincing essay I could for a homework assignment. Once I reached an age of double digits, I estimate that many, though not all days, I may have spent more than 12 hours per day studying when I add my study at home with the time spent in the classroom. I also greatly value the time I spent learning to play a musical instrument, or wandering in nature and in museums or attending the Summer Shakespeare plays and orchestral concerts my parents brought me and my siblings to. I believe schools and parents should foster a love for learning, endless curiosity, imagination, and questioning the ‘right answer’ in a way I did not see or sense in the schooling of my own children. As u.s. school are constituted, a 12 hour school day would bring the death of learning and those attributes I value. Son #1 is currently at a school where a 12h day is possible, if he went in for breakfast (07:30) and stayed for dinner (18:00) and left when the boarders do their prep (19:30ish). As it is, an 8.5h day is standard (08:45-17:15). He often goes in early for breakfast because it is a full English (sausages and bacon, hash browns, black pudding, eggs etc) but only stays late to play DnD! He also has Saturday school…. “Son #1” sounds like a name Musk would give to one of his kids. :) FYI that the Sonar 21 link seems to have some information it shouldn’t in the link URL.

AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs – Futurism There should be a case study about that headline as being indicative of a larger problem. The real headline, more descriptive of the contents of the article and the reality (and also very catchy) is buried at the last paragraph: “AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.” I drove by a ‘natural’ park in an arroyo yesterday, with pretty steep terrain, and a driverless mower on a two-track hydrostatic system was being driven by a parks worker with a R/C joystick gizmo, a dozen or so parks workers in sweatshirt uniforms watching. I circled back, got some pics, talked with El Jefe for a couple minutes. Asked him how soon he would plot waypoints via GPS, and have a computer driving it from an office with the lights off, the mower automatically re-docking to recharge batteries, and how many fewer staff he would have? He opined there was always weed-whacking to be done, doubted any man-power cuts. I was not in accord, but hey. Also asked him why they were mowing native bunch-grasses— wasn’t the point to be maintenance free and natural? I also suggested he get some bumper stickers printed up: “Support Universal Basic Income”. He was skeptical that Elroy, Jeff, Bill, Sergei would be delighted to start paying taxes to keep humans fed, clothed, warm, dry, and educated, with access to health care and clean potable water. Oh well. Who’s going to the park that the time and money will still be spent maintaining? a parks worker, or a forward deployed engineer? And if “natural”or “wildlife” was ever really the goal for the area, all machines would need to be removed as well. “Desperate Special Forces Bid to Save Pokrovsk Fails as AFU Faces Unprecedented Collapse on Every Front” I have no idea what good the Ukrainians thought that 11 special forces soldiers would do dropped near Pokrovsk. They were quickly wiped out so the whole thing was just a suicide mission. Seems that DC is going to have to get ready for several Ukrainian fortified cities to fall, one after another. I’m sure that Trump will demand an immediate ceasefire and to freeze this war on the contact line and if Russia does not agree, he will do something. But I bet that there will be an element of panic in the air when this happens, not only in DC but also in Brussels. A F U Hmmmm. Irony or paradox? A F U. Irony or Paradox? The fog of war keeps getting thicker. Who knows what their goal was? Extraction? Protecting key assets? A coked out plan to have commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day? A drowning person will grab on to anything they can in their desperation. I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. The AFU will be completely destroyed and any patriotic fighters left standing will join terror groups to make strikes throughout the world. The best guess I’ve read so far is that they were supposed to reach the “sculpted” Pokrovsk city sign at the western entrance to the city, as the helicopter landed less than half a mile away and five of them were killed within a few hundred yards of it. Had they reached it, they could have raised an Ukrainian flag there, take some photos and skedaddle to Dnipro with “solid proof” that Pokrovsk is like totally back under Ukrainian control. It would fit in with the previous high-risk, showy gimmicks Ukrainians tend to do to win the war in social media, but which have little if any effect on the war itself. Perhaps their intent was to surrender with the rest of the guys. That would sure be my goal. commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day This, my ol’ chap.

Nope. It´s mainly political. The real danger of course being how would the Russians react. Although, and I tend to agree, they would act only against targets on Ukrainian territory. Why risk more if the military fallout of Tomahawks would be really limited. Of course if the US wants to start WWIII. They can do that. But the fact that someone at Pentagon – allegedly – greenl-lit it now – doesn´t mean more than just that. Factions vs. factions. Provocation for sake of it due to lack of means and strategy.

I have a crazy notion and, if needed, talk me down. If they can get back to ridicuously easy money policy, they are going to credit “AI” with “productivity gains”. The U.S. joint staff aka pentagon said there are enough tomahawks to send some to Zelenski. Russian staff gets CNN feeds too! What was not said: Japan wants 400 for their missile destroyers, there not being much carrier in missile defense. Also, how to hit anything if U.S. does not provide top secret special access targeting and navigation aids. Those spunky Kievan contracts can get all the engineering specs to do what U.S. wants with tomahawks. Maybe shoot them off MiG 27’s. Are they karting in a ship to launch them from? A 50-foot sailing yacht named Andromeda. Of course! So efficient! From what I’ve seen, there are two batteries in the Army inventory. I assume one of these would be sent in theater. The launcher is housed in a 40-ft container, so an inviting target. I suppose you could park these in the far west by the Poland border to make it a more difficult counter-battery target. Targeting depends on the actual target and desired effect. If it’s a V-1-style terror effect, I suppose it’s possible that inertial nav all the way might be feasible. I would assume GPS denial is something Russia would pursue, at least near high-value targets. Tomahawk can have some onboard nav sensors that would be difficult to block, but depend on prior intel data, which I assume probably exists for any interesting targets. Enroute planning is based the missile RCS (detectability) and low-level flight to take advantage of terrain masking. Again you need intel of the anti-air defense capability. I don’t know, but assume these days actual terrain elevation data is sufficiently available and easily disseminated to shooters that that is no longer a limiting factor. While I suppose “black” programs could be postulated to exist, I continue to doubt the idea that a nuclear warhead option is available for any current missile or launcher.

Trump’s Retribution Campaign Leaves D.C. Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis (NY Times via archive.ph) America is a banana republic Under the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues. The speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law. But as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years. That a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image. Bad Jonathan! RE DHS Wants States to Hand Over Driver’s License Data for Citizenship Checks It’s amusing that a kind of national database of Americans, once anathema to conservatives, is being implemented by the Trump administration under the dubious pretense of stopping “voter fraud”. Literally there it is The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship. I imagine Republicans in Congress will pass a bill to outlaw this or conduct investigations any time now… That’s what the state ‘Real ID drivers license’ program is all about. It’s also the prelude to the rollout of official digital IDs. Note: you do not have to have a Real ID drivers license to drive, or even to fly.

Here is a very interesting video by Black American content creator Tabitha expanding on her theory that J D Vance will divorce his wife Usha in order to raise his chances of getting elected President. The New Kirx Klan Maga base will not tolerate a Brown Hindu Indian first lady. So Vance needs to get a new wife more to the New Kirx Klan’s MAGA-base’s liking. ” AMERICA FIRST… J.D. Vance Gets A Political Warning From A Leader of Young Republican Men!! ” https://www.youtube.com/live/M3E3t00nXQ4 thats sad as hell,lol. i know nothing about her, but i am an agnostic mystic druidy person, and my wife was catholic…and i supported our boys doing the catholic thing(imagine me in church…after her funeral mass, at the reception/dinner thing in the parish hall(overflow crowds), the Father pointedly sat by me, and we talked about Pseudodionysius,lol…because i am “not contained between my hat and my boots”…i told him that every priest needs a druid friend, and he agreed(!), but hasnt taken me up on it) so i understand multifaith marriage, and how much tolerance and forbearance it takes. thats the sort of example this country needs…and it would be doubly sad to see him cast that away…along with her and their kids…for some short term political calculation. The problem with that theory: Anyone that rabid about interracial marriage would likely not be excited about baby daddy to mixed kids. He can’t divorce the kids. I don’t know if the video talks about that. Don’t really want to watch it. Tabitha is pointing out that J D ” Despicable Little Tatoo” Vance is entirely soul-less, pragmatic and beneath ethics and morality. She therefor predicts that he will divorce his current wife and even try marrying the Widow Kirk if he can. It may not convince GroyperMAGA because of the mixed kids. But Vance will give it a good hard try. The test of a theory is in the coming-true or not of its predictions. If Vance divorces Suha then Tabitha’s theory is pretty good. If he then goes on to marry the Widow Kirk, then her theory is VERY good. Assuming Vance and his wife had a Catholic wedding, Vance would need to have the marriage annulled. Which can be done, but it is complicated. he is not married to his current wife “through the Catholic Church”. i state that categorically, because Tam and I tried, hard…but i would not lie.lol the part of the Catholic Church apparatus that deals with that, to my surprise, is what used to be called the Office of the Inquisition(yeah, that one,lol)…called something else more anodyne, now, that i dont remember. and they are hard core with their check boxes. i was babtise Lutheran, against my will, that wasnt even formed yet,lol…but that part was ok(i was an Xtian, in their eyes)…but i wouldnt submit to professions of Faith…which meant a hard NO!. theres no way in hell that Vance and his Hindu wife were married “through the church”. the Catholic government(what it is) takes their rules seriously. that Priest…Father Melvin…was a nice guy, and he meant well..a kind man, altogether. but he was a clerk…checking off boxes…not a spiritual leader. i found him kind and nice, but boring,lol. his successor out here, Father Red…young guy, inquisitive, well read…is much more inspiring…but also more strict when it comes to the Forms…ie: when he heard her last confession, and administered the Last rights, i had to leave the room…because i wasnt a Catholic. and she wanted me there. bt all that was between her and god, and i was damned to hell, and all. so i wasnt allowed in the temporarily Holy Space. lest i pollute it with my heathenism. Who knows. Maybe he will get ICE Barbie to put bounties on the children. I know a reasonable number of Evangelical Christians and the ones I know are not racists; in fact some of them are themselves Indian (from India) and some are married to Indian people. Vance would have a great advantage among Evangelicals to remain married to Usha, not just because he is supposed to remain married, but also because the question of her possible conversion would be endlessly fascinating to them. Regarding the Tesla robotaxi numbers Elon is spouting this line in the article stood out: “Considering that there are only two months left in the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla’s Robotaxi team will likely be extremely busy during the next eight weeks.” Curious, I looked up how many are currently in the road: There are ZERO on the road in the Bay Area. https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-is-trying-to-deceive-investors-into-thinking-it-has-san-francisco-robotaxis/ From 0 to 1,000 in eight weeks? Sounds like another one of Elon’s fanciful predictions. Also, according to that article they don’t have a California license for autonomous vehicles but the law isn’t a concern for Elon so doubt that is a concern. A.I. Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic (NY Times via archive.ph) Even though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year. There was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming. The posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the images, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own. This year is lit. Trump really is the perfect embodiment of our elite; petty, corrupt, self serving, careless, and entirely focused on immediate gratification. He’s the perfect symbol of a failing state, an empire in terminal decline, entirely unaware even of the limits of power or concerned with the outcomes of its exercise. Well put. I might hazard to add that the corruption is consuming everything and everyone around him. We’re down to M T-G and Massie on the GOP side as the only pols left with anything resembling a soul. Even Rand Paul has become a petty, corrupt little tyrant. He was blathering on about raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 the other day – as if there aren’t a gazillion other real issues out there. I guess kicking old people when they’re down is easier than taking on the MIC, endless wars, genocide, and economic insanity … remember when Rand Paul actually stood up against someone more powerful than him? Remember when his Dad fought to audit the Fed? It’s all a memory now. Other than the immediate gratification bit, that description might serve just as well for Biden, which is appropriate given the Uniparty nature of the late stage empire’s elite Israel’s Zombie Economy Part 3: Israel’s Breakdown Into Tribes – Bassam Haddad Interviews Shir Hever Part 3 of 5 part series by Jadaliyya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJTTm1Ep1mA We are not obsessed with serial killers. The PRESS is obsessed with sensationalism. And only about doing sensationalism with POOR & POWERLESS serial killers. Why? To distract us all from the actual MASS MURDERERS, GENOCIDAL even, that present themselves as “democratic” or “moderate” or “good” people: – Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, Netahyanu, etc. There is not a single POOR & POWERLESS serial killer that reaches even near the kill count of the 5 Hitlers mentioned above. The Press exists to distract and manipulate. The capital/property exists to own the Press. The labour rights DON’T exist in order to facilitate taming actual journalists. The ones that refuse being tamed end up like Assange or the Gaza journalists… This is what “freedom and democracy” really means in the collective West nowadays, and perhaps since always. We all rember that POOR & POWERLESS guy named Jack, the reaper, from London. But the biggest serial killer of them all, in London, are Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill, responsible for the provoked famine in colonized Bangladesh, resulting in the GENOCIDE of around 3 million humans. The same press that tells us we “are absessed” with serial killers, doesn’t write a single line about the biggest serial killers of all, who exterminate millions of humans. Because when a serial killer is RICH & POWERFUL, the western “free and democratic” Press calls them “heroes” and “exemplar leaders”… Sorry, there is plenty of evidence to counter your assertion. Mystery novels and movies, which are not press organs, are also fixated with serial killers. See the Academy Award winner Silence of the Lambs as one of many examples. The Hollywood and the Press (aka MSM) are two cheeks of the same behind. Different organs working in concert. Yup. They are obsessed, and we are getting the mushroom treatment. I’m not obsessed with serial killers. Couldn’t care less. My buddy says he’s a cereal killer and a celery stalker.

Title: Reddit’s CEO Debuts As A Billionaire 20 Years After Cofounding The Company
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2025/11/01/reddits-ceo-debuts-as-a-steve-huffman-billionaire-20-years-after-cofounding-the-company/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByMonica Hunter-Hart, Forbes Staff. Reddit has hit its stride. After trudging through 19 years of almost entirely losing money, the platform recorded its first quarterly profit as a public company a year ago—and just posted its most lucrative financials yet. The company announced a net income of $163 million on Thursday, marking five consecutive quarters of profitability, about a year and a half after going public. The market rewarded the company. Reddit’s stock closed at $208.95 on Friday, up 7.5% from the previous day and up 75% year over year. It was enough to bump the fortune of cofounder and CEO Steve Huffman up to $1.2 billion. “Q3 was a strong quarter,” Huffman said on Thursday’s earnings call, in which he lauded Reddit as being “for humans by humans” and seemed to take a subtle dig at AI slop (the low-quality AI content clogging corners of the internet): “Reddit is in a unique position; we’re not trying to be the next anything. We’re focused on being the best version of ourselves and what the internet needs most: a place where people can connect on almost any topic and find genuinely useful information.” Authentic human recommendations are a hot commodity these days. As bots and sponsored content crowd the internet, Reddit is often seen as a more reliable source of information, and its popularity has exploded in the past couple of years. Daily active users have approximately doubled since the summer of 2023. Google searches increasingly surface links to Reddit: Organic search to the platform is up over 560% from two years ago, per data from digital marketing firm Semrush. Given that Facebook, Twitter (now X) and LinkedIn long ago minted a class of early-2000s social media billionaires, it may seem surprising that Huffman is so late to join that club. After all, Reddit was the world’s seventh-most visited website in September, according to Similarweb, ahead of LinkedIn, TikTok and Netflix. But that’s because Huffman, now 41, unloaded his founder’s stake in the then startup in 2006. About a year after launching the company in June 2005, he and his partner Alexis Ohanian—now a venture capitalist married to tennis icon Serena Williams—sold out to Condé Nast for just $10 million. It seemed an enormous sum for them at the time, the pair has said. Without any plans for monetization, and overwhelmed with running the exploding platform with just a few employees, they viewed the acquisition as a rescue. Perhaps in the short term, but long term, they left massive sums on the table. By 2014, the company was valued at $500 million. Ohanian, who joined Reddit’s board in 2014 but left in 2020, has said he did reacquire some shares while on the board, but likely gets most of his fortune from his many startup investments. Huffman, on the other hand, appears to be Reddit’s biggest individual shareholder these days. That’s because Reddit poached him back in 2015 to help navigate a streak of operational crises. His pay-for-performance compensation package has since allowed him to amass 3.1 million shares, or a 2.3% stake in the company. The rest of his fortune lies in Reddit stock options and $190 million in cash and other investments, Forbes estimates. Huffman declined to comment for this story. While generous stock awards are common among the billionaire CEO set—Tesla investors are even weighing whether to approve a $1 trillion compensation package for Elon Musk this week—it’s rare for an executive to build up such a significant stake essentially from scratch. In its 2024 IPO document, the company explained that it had massively increased the compensation of Huffman and COO Jen Wong the previous year because their packages had not been “providing the incentive initially intended”; Huffman’s ballooned to $193.2 million in 2023. It’s easy to argue that he’s earned his payday. When he became CEO in 2015, Reddit was in a state of emergency. The company was moderating content with an ultra-light touch, but it was becoming clear that some “subreddit” communities were overwhelmed with toxicity and harassment. When Reddit fired a popular employee who had been the company’s main contact with its volunteer moderators, moderators protested by shutting down their subreddits in what became known as the “Great Reddit Blackout.” A week later, Huffman took over. “It was 10 years into Reddit of ‘we don’t ban things,’” he recently told “The Best One Yet” podcast. “I think that was one of the things that only a founder can do, because the existing team at Reddit was so scared. This is what they told me: They were scared of changing anything, because they thought they’d ruin Reddit.” Huffman began by implementing the platform’s first content policy, which included prohibitions on spam, bullying, inciting violence and illegal activity. His team quickly banned a collection of subreddits, including some devoted to animated child pornography and a network of racist subs promoting “a proper society that lacks the negro plague.” Reddit began “quarantining” subs it deemed licit but especially offensive, requiring users to opt in before viewing their content. One example: r/PicsOfDeadKids, which was fully banned a few years later, as sometimes happens to quarantined subs. The goal was to make the space not only more pleasant for users, but also more attractive for advertisers. (Reddit does not run promotions on quarantined content.) Huffman and his team fixated early on advertising as the best initial monetization strategy for Reddit, in part because it could help them keep the platform free. “He built the company’s advertising business from the ground up,” says Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan. One of the challenges has been helping brands target their ads without compromising Reddit’s pivotal user anonymity. Unlike platforms like Meta and Google—which allow promoters to personalize ads based on demographic data and broader tracking across the internet—Reddit requires brands to use context clues. If a user joins a parenting subreddit or upvotes posts about pregnancy, for example, they may be more likely to see promotions for baby products. So far, it’s working. Advertising brought in $549 million last quarter, 94% of Reddit’s revenue. The company was generating only around $12 to $15 million in total sales when Huffman joined. New challenges lie ahead. Reddit is at the nexus of many of today’s hot-button debates, from the ethics around training AI models on user data to compromises between free speech and content moderation to the viability of text-based content in an online culture that’s increasingly focused on video. Huffman appears unfazed: “No matter what you’re going through, someone on Reddit has already been there, done that, and shared the story,” he said Thursday. “The best pitch for Reddit is Reddit’s content.” The son of divorced parents, Huffman grew up in a small town in Virginia near Washington, D.C. Starting and running his own business “always seemed like a possibility,” he once said, thanks in part to his father’s wild imagination for ventures (he was an engineer at GM) and his stepdad’s financial savviness (he was chief marketing officer at Unisys). He learned how to program computers when he was young and leveraged the hobby into a computer science degree at the University of Virginia, where he met Ohanian. By the end of their senior year, the pair knew they wanted to start some sort of company together. It was just the concept that needed tweaking. Huffman’s first idea was software for ordering food on a phone. The task sounds quaint and obvious now, but this was before the app era—and the newly formed startup accelerator Y Combinator rejected their pitch, termed “My Mobile Menu.” Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham was nevertheless impressed enough with the duo that he asked them to submit another idea. Their second pitch was accepted. With a $12,000 grant in hand, they spent a few weeks designing Reddit before launching it shortly after their graduation, when Huffman was 21. Then came snowballing user growth, 16-hour workdays and the eventual sale to Condé Nast. Huffman stayed on as acting CEO until 2009, when he left to cofound another company: the travel search engine Hipmunk. Concur acquired Hipmunk in 2016 for an undisclosed sum and shut it down in 2020. Meanwhile, Condé Nast had spun out Reddit again and raised funds from outside investors like future OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman, but was having trouble monetizing the business. That’s when Huffman stepped back in. In addition to building ad revenue, Huffman’s early projects included a site redesign and the creation of a mobile app. The platform, which had 12 million daily users when he rejoined, now has 116 million. Reddit has historically been a U.S.-centric site, but it recently implemented translation capabilities for 30 languages so that users can easily read and contribute in their non-native tongues. That’s led to a 31% bump in international daily users over the past year. These days, Reddit’s second biggest source of revenue is licensing its content to train AI models. The platform used to allow free and open access to its application programming interface (API), where developers interact with all of the site’s data. But Reddit started charging for its API in 2023. It now works to block unknown bots from crawling the site, and is suing a handful of AI companies—including the search engine Perplexity—for allegedly scraping its data without permission. A select few have paid for permission. Huffman signed licensing deals with Google and OpenAI last year for a reported $60 million and $70 million, respectively. The site’s enormous collection of real-time, human-generated content has proven to be extremely valuable: Reddit was the most-cited source for Google’s AI Overview citations, and the second-most for ChatGPT’s, between August 2024 and June 2025, per the AI analytics platform Profound. Given Reddit’s centrality to their models, those fees could be seen as quite low. The $60 million Google reportedly paid is just 0.07% of the more than $90 billion that its parent company Alphabet (market cap: $3.4 trillion) expects to spend on AI infrastructure this year. “Those price tags set a low watermark,” says Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at Baird. “As Reddit has more negotiating leverage, as the power of their content becomes more clear to the models, then I think the next deals should likely be priced higher than that.” And there’s always the risk that Reddit, in propping up AI chatbots, could diminish its own relevance. As something of a hedge, Huffman launched “Reddit Answers” in December, later telling investors that he wants the platform to become a “go-to search engine.” A search query into “Reddit Answers” returns a list of quoted recommendations from real users (with links to the original comments), collated by AI. Huffman has acknowledged that Google search traffic to Reddit has at times been challenged by the rise of AI but again is confident in its future. “Part of what helps them balance on the tightrope is that I think the language models want Reddit to survive,” says Sebastian. “Realistically, these models need a constant flow of authentic, human-generated content, and that’s hard to find. It can’t just be synthetic data. So there’s almost a perverse incentive for Google and Open AI to keep Reddit as a robust app for users.” To personally test that Reddit user experience, Huffman spends a fair amount of time on the platform himself. He’s published over 1,000 posts and comments; he hosts AMAs (“Ask Me Anything” sessions). Prior to the earnings announcement, his last activity was an Oct. 3 comment in response to a user celebrating that the 117 Reddit shares they’d bought at the IPO had since gone up more than 500% in value. Huffman replied with a smiley face. This story was updated at 12 p.m. on Sunday after Reddit replied with some additional context including the fact that Q3 2024 was the company’s third profitable quarter. The other two profitable quarters were when the company was private.

Title: Here's What We Learned From Big Tech Earnings Last Week

Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."

Title: U.S. Health Insurers Face Headwinds as Q3 Earnings Reveal Mounting Cost Pressures

Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:01:14Z
Full Content:
U.S. health insurers experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting increased medical costs and significant policy-related pressures, which led to a notable decline in share prices across the sector. U.S. health insurance companies encountered substantial financial headwinds in the third quarter, reporting results marked by escalating medical costs and the looming impact of legislative changes. The sector's performance lagged the broader market, with several major players experiencing significant stock price depreciation. The third-quarter earnings season, which commenced on October 21, unveiled a consistent theme of increased cost pressures across the health insurance industry. A primary driver of these rising expenses has been the government-subsidized Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans, where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, specifically highlighted heightened acuity levels among its Medicaid enrollees following the resumption of state-led procedural disenrollment in March 2023. Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) reported a substantial $6.6 billion third-quarter loss, a stark contrast to its $713 million profit in the same period last year. This loss was largely attributed to escalating healthcare costs and a $6.7 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. The impairment was a consequence of a sustained decline in Centene's stock price throughout 2025 and the anticipated financial repercussions of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which forecasts $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies over the next decade. Centene's health benefits ratio (HBR), the proportion of premiums spent on medical care, climbed to 92.7%, up from 89.2% a year prior, underscoring the rising cost burden. Market reactions to these results were swift and negative. Since October 20, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares fell 9.1%, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) declined 5.4%, and The Cigna Group (CI) dropped 19.5%. The most pronounced decrease among major managed care insurers was recorded by Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH), which saw its stock price decrease by 23.5%. These declines surpassed those of the broader market, with the S&P 500 falling 2.47% and the S&P Insurance Index decreasing 2.15% over the same period. The adverse market reaction reflects investor concerns over several interconnected factors. Primarily, the rising medical expense ratios indicate a squeeze on profitability, particularly as insurers grapple with sicker patient populations in government-funded programs. The "One Big Beautiful Bill" has introduced significant political uncertainty and financial risk, with projections suggesting it could eliminate health coverage for nearly 12 million Americans. This directly impacts insurers like Centene, which manage Medicaid plans for over 12 million low-income individuals. Furthermore, issues are not confined solely to Medicaid. UnitedHealth also noted the expected impact of changes within the ACA markets. The company anticipates that rate increases exceeding 25% and targeted service area reductions could lead to a decrease of approximately two-thirds in its Obamacare customer base, potentially forcing over one million enrollees to seek alternative coverage. These aggressive actions, while aimed at improving margins in the employer and individual segment by 2026, suggest ongoing struggles to achieve targeted profitability levels. The sector's performance in the third quarter highlights a challenging operating environment exacerbated by both fundamental cost pressures and a shifting regulatory landscape. The substantial goodwill impairment reported by Centene underscores the market's re-evaluation of long-term prospects in light of evolving healthcare policy. The company's valuation review specifically cited the expected financial impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a key factor. The broader market implications are significant. As insurers face increased costs and legislative changes that could reduce their customer base and subsidies, the sustainability of current business models, particularly within government-sponsored programs, comes into question. The aggressive rate hikes by UnitedHealthcare in the ACA marketplace indicate an industry-wide effort to adapt to these new realities, potentially at the expense of market share. While specific analyst quotes were not provided in the briefing, the collective sentiment from company executives and market movements suggests a cautious outlook. UnitedHealthcare chief executive Tim Noel indicated that the company's submitted rate filings reflect the 2025 morbidity and experience, including average rate increases of over 25%, as a necessary measure to improve margins. The acknowledgment that these margins are still projected to remain below the targeted 7–9% range for 2026 further underscores the persistent challenges. Investors will closely monitor several key factors in the coming quarters. The full implementation and impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and its projected cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will be a critical determinant for sector profitability. The ability of insurers to manage medical costs effectively, particularly within Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, will remain paramount. Furthermore, the strategies employed by major players like UnitedHealthcare to navigate the ACA landscape, including the potential for significant enrollee shifts, will provide insights into the sector's adaptability. The interplay of legislative policy, evolving patient demographics, and cost containment efforts will define the trajectory for U.S. health insurers in the near to medium term. ## Cinemark Holdings Exceeds Q3 2025 Revenue and Adjusted EPS Estimates **Cinemark Holdings, Inc.** (**CNK**) announced its third-quarter 2025 financial results, reporting an **adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.87**, which notably surpassed analyst expectations by $0.38. The cinema operator also recorded **revenue of $857.50 million**, exceeding consensus estimates by $16.47 million. This positive performance contributed to a **7.63% rise** in the company's stock following the announcement, reflecting a bullish market sentiment. ## Detailed Q3 2025 Financial Performance For the third quarter of 2025, **Cinemark** reported total revenue of approximately **$858 million**, slightly above the anticipated $846.91 million. While the company's adjusted EPS showed a significant beat, its **diluted earnings per share (GAAP)** stood at **$0.40**, falling short of estimated $0.47. Net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. was **$49.5 million**, with the overall net income recorded at **$51 million**, a decrease from $187.8 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA reached **$178 million** with a healthy margin of **20.7%**, and free cash flow generation was **$38 million**, contributing to a cash balance of **$461 million** by quarter-end. A key financial highlight was **Cinemark's** successful retirement of all remaining pandemic-related debt, including the settlement of **$460 million** in convertible notes. This strategic move significantly reduced total long-term debt to **$1,876.0 million** as of September 30, 2025. Demonstrating confidence in its financial health and future outlook, the company's Board of Directors authorized a **$300 million share repurchase program** and approved a **12.5% increase** in the quarterly cash dividend, raising it to **$0.09 per share**. ## Market Reaction and Underlying Drivers The market's positive reaction to **Cinemark's** Q3 2025 earnings, evidenced by the **7.63% stock increase**, can be primarily attributed to the strong top-line beat, the adjusted EPS exceeding forecasts, and significant strides in balance sheet deleveraging. The successful elimination of pandemic-related debt signals a return to financial normalcy and improved operational flexibility for the company. Furthermore, the initiation of a substantial share repurchase program and a dividend increase underscore management's commitment to enhancing shareholder value, often perceived as a strong indicator of future profitability and stability. Despite the GAAP diluted EPS missing estimates, investors appear to have prioritized the adjusted earnings strength, revenue growth, and robust capital allocation strategies. ## Broader Context and Industry Implications **Cinemark's** performance aligns with the broader recovery trend observed in the movie theater market. The global movie theater market is projected to reach **$83.16 billion in 2025**, exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of **5.24%** from 2025 to 2033. This growth is largely fueled by the increasing popularity of blockbuster films and a resurgence of audience attendance in theaters across key markets, including the U.S., China, and Germany. **Cinemark's** ability to generate strong revenue and cash flow, coupled with its aggressive debt reduction, positions it favorably within this recovering landscape. The company is actively capitalizing on the renewed consumer interest in the theatrical experience, strengthening its foundation for sustained growth. ## Looking Ahead Moving forward, **Cinemark's** focus on delivering compelling content and enhancing the movie-going experience, alongside its strengthened financial position, will be critical. The authorized share repurchase program and increased dividend are expected to continue supporting investor confidence. Key factors to monitor include the pipeline of upcoming film releases, sustained audience attendance levels, and the company's ability to further optimize its operational costs and balance sheet. The ongoing recovery of the broader entertainment sector suggests a potentially positive trajectory for **Cinemark** as it continues to navigate the evolving market dynamics and capitalize on returning consumer demand. ## Amazon Initiates Legal Action Against Perplexity AI Over Agentic Commerce **Amazon (AMZN.US)** has filed a lawsuit against **Perplexity AI Inc.**, a move signaling growing tensions between established e-commerce platforms and emerging artificial intelligence technologies. The legal action centers on allegations that Perplexity's AI browser agent, named **Comet**, has engaged in unauthorized access and activities on Amazon's retail platform, including making purchases on behalf of users without proper disclosure. Amazon asserts that these actions constitute computer fraud and violate its established terms of service, which explicitly prohibit "the use of any data mining, Robotics, or similar data collection and extraction tool." The e-commerce giant claims that Perplexity has bypassed technological barriers designed to prevent AI agent access, further escalating the dispute. Amazon had previously issued a cease-and-desist letter to the AI startup, leading to a temporary halt in the agent's deployment. However, Perplexity reportedly resumed the practice with an updated version of its Comet browser agent, prompting Amazon's formal legal challenge. The lawsuit specifically invokes the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**, 18 U.S.C. section 1030, a federal statute designed to combat unauthorized access to computer networks, and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. ## Perplexity AI Rebuts, Citing Bullying and Revenue Protection **Perplexity AI Inc.**, currently valued at **$20 billion**, has vehemently denied Amazon's allegations, framing the lawsuit as an attempt by the e-commerce titan to protect its substantial advertising business and stifle innovation in AI-driven commerce. A spokesperson for Perplexity told Forbes, "> Bullying is not innovation," suggesting that Amazon's actions are a barrier to technological progress rather than a legitimate defense against platform abuse. Perplexity argues that Amazon's advertising revenue model, which relies heavily on selling priority placement in search results to merchants, is threatened by the advent of AI shopping agents that could streamline the purchasing process and potentially reduce the efficacy of traditional ad placements. Amazon reported **$17.7 billion** from selling digital ads in Q3 2025 alone, marking a **24%** increase from the previous year, with annual advertising revenue reaching **$56.2 billion**. This significant revenue stream provides a clear economic context for Amazon's robust defense of its platform integrity. ## Broader Implications for AI, E-commerce, and Regulatory Precedent This high-profile legal dispute extends beyond the immediate parties, raising critical questions about the future of **agentic AI** in retail and the evolving landscape of digital commerce. Industry experts, as quoted in Engadget, suggest that "> This is fighting over the future of AI shopping," highlighting the potential for this case to set significant precedents for how AI agents interact with online platforms and consumer data. Moreover, the confrontation underscores the increasing importance of data privacy and security within AI systems. The use of large language models (LMs) to consume vast datasets introduces complex vulnerabilities, impacting trust, compliance, and business continuity. Financial institutions, for example, face risks ranging from direct data theft and fraud to regulatory penalties and reputational damage if AI systems are compromised. The Amazon-Perplexity case serves as a stark reminder of these intertwined risks and the need for clear guidelines governing AI deployment. ## Looking Ahead: Navigating the Future of AI-Driven Commerce The outcome of the lawsuit between Amazon and Perplexity AI will likely have far-reaching implications for both the e-commerce sector and the burgeoning AI industry. A ruling in Amazon's favor could empower platform owners to exert greater control over third-party AI agent interactions, potentially limiting the scope of autonomous shopping experiences. Conversely, a decision favoring Perplexity could pave the way for more integrated and automated AI-driven purchasing solutions, potentially disrupting existing revenue models reliant on traditional advertising. Stakeholders will be closely monitoring judicial interpretations of computer fraud laws in the context of AI agent access, as well as potential regulatory responses. The case could catalyze discussions around new standards for ethical AI deployment, data access, and consumer protection in an increasingly automated online environment. The ongoing developments will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of AI integration in everyday commerce, influencing investment strategies and technological innovation across the digital economy. ## Live Nation Entertainment Reports Q3 Earnings Below Expectations, Shares Decline **Live Nation Entertainment (LYV)** experienced a notable decline in its share price following the announcement of third-quarter earnings that fell considerably short of analyst estimates. Despite reporting what the company characterized as a "record quarter" driven by robust fan demand, investor reaction was decidedly negative, with shares falling **5.8%** in after-hours trading on Tuesday. ## Detailed Financial Performance For the third quarter, **Live Nation** reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of **$0.73**. This figure was substantially lower than the consensus analyst estimate of **$1.48**, representing a miss of **$0.75**. Concurrently, the company's revenue reached **$8.5 billion**, an **11%** increase year-over-year. However, this still marginally missed the analyst forecast of **$8.89 billion** by **$390 million**. These shortfalls overshadowed underlying operational successes, which included a **24%** rise in operating income to **$793 million** and a **14%** growth in adjusted operating income to **$1.03 billion**. The quarter also saw significant operational growth, with stadium show counts increasing **60%** globally, while fan spending at amphitheaters and major festivals rose by **8%** and **6%**, respectively. ## Market Reaction and Underlying Factors The market's adverse reaction, evidenced by the immediate share price drop, indicates that the significant miss on profitability metrics overshadowed the company's record revenue figures and operational growth. Investors appeared to prioritize the earnings per share shortfall against expectations, suggesting a focus on the company's ability to translate strong demand and revenue growth into commensurate bottom-line performance. The reported adjusted EPS of **$0.73** for the current quarter also represents a considerable decline compared to the **$1.66** reported in the year-ago quarter, further contributing to investor apprehension. ## Broader Context and Future Outlook While **Live Nation** highlighted strong fan engagement and record segment revenues, the disconnect between top-line growth and bottom-line delivery has prompted a reevaluation of the company's efficiency and profit margins by the market. The company had previously anticipated an **8%** annual growth rate in the industry, and the Q3 results will likely lead to increased scrutiny of how **Live Nation** plans to capitalize on this growth profitably. Future guidance and strategic initiatives aimed at improving earnings per share will be closely monitored by analysts and investors as the company navigates a dynamic live entertainment market.
