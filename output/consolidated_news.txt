April 24, 2025 11:22 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, April 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, all dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until this Monday, April 28, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D. Cal.), the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit charges Rocket Lab as well as certain of Rocket Lab’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-rocket-lab-usa-inc-class-action-lawsuit-rklb.html You can also contact attorneys J.C.

For more on gears, check out my general Gears Guide, detailing the price, rarity, and use of each type. Let’s get right into the rankings! These Gears financially pay off and then some! If you want to rapidly increase your produce profits and uncover some unusually large and valuable crops, invest in these Gears! These Gears are decent alternatives if you can’t afford or find the S-Tiers in stock. They help grow the size of your produce and uncover valuable mutations, but aren’t as efficient as those in the top tier. Nestled into the average tier, these Gears are solid options to make a quick buck. They’re not the most powerful or fruitful (get it?), but they’re profitable! Whilst not entirely useless, you could safely avoid these Gears and not miss out on much. They’re not great for long-term profits, and hardly make their money back. I wouldn’t recommend investing in these Gears. You’re better off waiting for Mother Nature to handle your crops than sink money into these.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a vocal supporter of Starlink, but on Wednesday, he touted SpaceX rival AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing satellites for cellular connectivity. On X, Carr posted pictures of his visit with GOP Senator Ted Cruz to AST SpaceMobile’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. One picture includes Carr and Cruz posing with AST SpaceMobile CEO Abel Avellan in front of the company's offices. He also published a video discussing the importance of AST, saying the company is creating manufacturing jobs in the US and helping the country counter China’s satellite ambitions. “Importantly, it’s going to help us secure our national defense, including by making sure we stay ahead of China,” Carr says. Curiously, Carr’s tweets didn’t mention AST by name. Instead, his video described the company as a “high-tech satellite production facility that’s putting up the biggest satellites we’ve ever had in the country.” AST’s CEO called out the video, posting on X: “Proud to be based in Texas, where we build and test our American satellite technology.” AST SpaceMobile still needs to secure FCC licenses to test and commercially operate its satellites. Last year, the commission only granted AST limited authority to operate its first five “BlueBird” satellites while tabling its request to launch and operate an additional 243 satellites. AST is also preparing to launch and test an even larger, more powerful BlueBird prototype satellite. But last week, the Indian Space Research Organisation postponed the satellite’s launch from Q2 to July. The FCC must also clear that prototype satellite for experimental testing, which could take months. AST faces a tight timeline since its mobile carrier partners in Europe and Japan want to start rolling out the satellite connectivity next year. The company needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit before it can offer continuous coverage over the US. The resulting satellite network is poised to compete against SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is currently available as a beta and will officially launch in July through T-Mobile. Although Carr has supported Starlink, he’s indicated he backs next-generation satellite players in general. This includes saying the FCC must streamline regulations for Starlink and Amazon’s satellite internet rival, Project Kuiper. He’s also urged European governments to adopt Starlink over Chinese satellite services.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash grows to $103B – Should we be concerned?

What if Satoshi breaks the decade-long silence and sells? Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin [BTC], has once again found their dormant fortune thrust into the spotlight as BTC prices surge past $94,000. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin under their control, untouched since the protocol’s earliest days, Nakamoto’s holdings have now soared past the $103 billion mark, dramatically reclaiming billionaire status. This rally, which marks a 27% rebound from Bitcoin’s recent five-month low, has sparked both celebration and unease within the crypto community. As the asset approaches uncharted highs, speculation is intensifying around the one question that has lingered for years: what happens if Satoshi ever decides to sell? Source: Meta Gorgonite/X Echoing similar sentiments, was another X (formerly Twitter) user – Dan Lucro, who added, “The question is, will he ever sell… and when?” As expected, another user put it best when he said, Source: Nate Ryan/X Even as Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, falling to $92,357.57 at press time, following a 1.44% daily drop, Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary Bitcoin holdings remain untouched. The estimated 1.1 million BTC attributed to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator were mined in the network’s infancy using what is now known as the “Patoshi Pattern,” a distinct mining fingerprint that has helped trace these early coins. Despite growing market speculation and price momentum, Nakamoto has never moved a single coin from this massive stash, further fueling the mystique surrounding their identity and long-term intentions. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption continues to grow, entities like BlackRock and MicroStrategy now collectively hold more BTC than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated stash. While Tesla’s 11,509 BTC may not rival these giants, its steadfast commitment to holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset reflects a broader shift among public companies embracing digital currencies. Yet, the absence of fiduciary responsibility sets Nakamoto’s untouched holdings apart, unlike corporations whose Bitcoin reserves are subject to regulatory oversight and shareholder scrutiny. Interestingly, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor recently floated the idea of permanently removing access to BTC by destroying private keys after death. Hence, in a market shaped by both institutional control and mythical origins, the tension between utility and ownership continues to define Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.

Title: China Market Update: Tariff Talk Roller Coaster Continues

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Online education company TAL Education missed on the big three (revenue, net income, and earnings per share), despite top-line revenue growth increasing by +42% year-over-year, as selling, marketing, administrative expenses increased to $336 million from $24 million YoY, which weighed on bottom line net income and EPS. The company only used $13.1mm of its $490.7mm share repurchase program, which is strange to me. Thus far, no analyst has asked management about relisting in Hong Kong. I will provide a Hong Kong relisting update via Twitter (@ahern_brendan). Asian stocks were lower, except for Vietnam, which outperformed the region. This followed roller coaster comments Wednesday, as President Donald Trump suggested tariff rollbacks could be in the cards soon. China’s Ministry of Commerce threw cold water on Trump’s suggestion that talks are already in motion. The MoC said, “There are no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States, at present.” The comments indicate a lack of understanding that the "Art of the Deal" requires Kabuki theatre, drama, and showmanship. Hopefully, the two sides will communicate with one another at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington this week. Premier Li and the State Council once again reiterated that it is necessary to “stabilize the stock market and continue to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market." Mainland media outlet Yicai noted that U.S. shipments of liquid natural gas to China went to zero in March, versus 412,500 tons in March 2024, as China’s 99% LNG tariff and 94% oil tariff take hold. The European container shipping index futures fell -9% overnight. It is hard to know whether fewer boats going to the U.S. means more supply for Europe, leading to the price decline, or indicating the trade war is weighing on the global economy. Regardless, the two sides should get talking, in my humble opinion. Without question, the biggest news was declines in Meituan and JD.com shares, which fell -5.15% and -6.19%, respectively, overnight, as JD reported a substantial uptick in its new restaurant delivery service. The likely price war is apt to weigh on the companies’ financials. JD.com, as the leader in online electronic sales, was well-positioned to benefit from the new electronic subsidies through the expansion into restaurant delivery, curbing investor enthusiasm. The price action seems to be an instance of "shooting first and asking questions later, " as investors recall self-defeating battles, including that between Didi and Uber. Internet stocks were off, as defensive plays such as banks, nonferrous metals, mining, and telecom outperformed. It is worth noting that Southbound Stock Connect had $436 million worth of net buying, concentrated in Alibaba and Meituan. Mainland investors now hold 8.64% of Alibaba’s shares outstanding. Southbound Stock Connect's percentage ownership continues to rise. Tencent is 11.78% owned by Mainland investors, Kuaishou is 15.76% owned, and Meituan is 10.96% owned, based on shares outstanding. Today, 43% of Hong Kong’s turnover was via Southbound, which indicates the lack of foreign investor participation, which was out of sight, and out of mind. Mainland China had a non-eventful night, as banks and insurance outperformed, battery giant CATL gained +1.51%, and Midea gained +1.53%. These were rare growth outperformers in the current market. Software and technology, including electronic equipment and communications equipment, underperformed. The National Team’s favored ETFs had very light volumes. Carmaker BYD reports Friday.

Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.

The agreement marks the first full-scale flight test contract awarded by Kratos through the MACH-TB 2.0 program-a $1.45 billion effort aimed at expanding access to hypersonic testing. Rocket Lab was added to the MACH-TB 2.0 subcontractor team in January, building on its prior MACH-TB engagements, which included three successful test launches, two of which occurred within a three-week span. HASTE, the Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron, is a modified version of Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, tailored for suborbital missions. Sharing core technologies like 3D-printed engines and carbon composite structures, HASTE is designed with a reconfigured upper Kick Stage and can accommodate payloads up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). It supports testing of hypersonic, glide, ballistic, and atmospheric reentry systems at speeds exceeding 7.5 km/s. Across both its HASTE and Electron platforms, Rocket Lab has launched over 200 payloads. "In less than two years since its first launch, HASTE has quickly emerged as a leading commercial test platform of hypersonic systems. With our operational speed and cadence, and the ability to serve multiple mission profiles all in one platform, HASTE is helping to move the needle on hypersonic innovation. I'm confident this will be the first of many new opportunities to serve the nation through the MACH-TB program, and we're proud to be working alongside Kratos to bring this test flight to the launch pad on a rapid timeline," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. This mission joins a growing schedule of HASTE launches set for 2025 and 2026. Among upcoming flights is a test for the Defense Innovation Unit involving a scramjet-powered vehicle, an extension of a five-launch agreement with Leidos, and a classified hypersonic test for an undisclosed client. In parallel with MACH-TB, Rocket Lab's HASTE platform has been incorporated into other major defense initiatives. In the United States, HASTE is now eligible under the $46 billion Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC), expanding its potential role in U.S. Air Force projects. In the UK, HASTE has been included in the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 1 billion Hypersonic Technologies and Capability Development Framework, reinforcing its international strategic value.

Title: Elon Musk’s Luck Runs Out

Why he didn’t see this coming Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts For a while, it seemed as if DOGE Elon and Tesla Elon could exist in the same space-time continuum. One of them carried out Donald Trump’s ruthless cost-cutting mission while the other pitched cars that appealed most to people who were highly likely to oppose that mission, or even rage against it. As activists spray-painted STOP DOGE on Teslas at dealerships and anti-Tesla protests spread all over the world, there still was no concrete proof that Elon Musk had to amend either version of himself. Then this week came Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report since Musk started his work with DOGE, showing the company’s profits down 71 percent from the same time last year. After a conference call, one major investor said Musk was “delusional.” Suddenly it seemed as if Musk was on a “Kanye West–like trajectory,” according to Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs and our guest this week on Radio Atlantic. George has been covering Tesla since the 2010s. He’s watched Musk shoot himself in the foot in the lead-up to this moment, so he is well placed to understand why Musk didn’t see this coming. In this week’s episode, the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel interviews George about how Musk found himself in this predicament. The following is a transcript of the episode: News clip: Growing backlash against Elon Musk and his new role in President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE— News clip: Protestors taking out their anger on the Tesla car and owners were busy all over the country— News clip: Tesla, the car company Musk founded and runs, has seen its stock price fall dramatically, as you can see from this chart— As Patrick George, the editor in chief of InsideEVs, wrote in The Atlantic this week: Luck runs out. Patrick George: I think he thought he would come in and gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader and that everything would’ve worked out great just the way it always has. He’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are, you know—they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here. [Music] Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is Radio Atlantic. My colleague Charlie Warzel interviewed Patrick George recently about the tumultuous journey Tesla’s been on, from darling of the environmentally conscious to target of tire slashing. And the two of them land on Musk’s blind spot, which caused him to miss this coming crash. Charlie Warzel: Patrick George, welcome to Radio Atlantic. Thank you for joining me. George: Great to be here, Charlie. Thanks for having me. Rosin: Their conversation explains so well how we got to this moment. George: Covering Tesla in the 2010s, the kind of hate mail we would get from people whenever we’d criticize the company or put something negative in one of the reviews of the Tesla, whatever—there were so many people back then who were such true believers in what he was doing, I mean, thinking that he’s saving the world. And I’m kind of sad for those folks now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their Teslas. Those are the ones who feel abandoned right now, who feel betrayed by this guy they once believed in who has very much gone to what they perceive as the dark side. Warzel: What has been going through your head over the last few months as we’re watching, you know, Musk take this role in the government and have this interplay between his polarization and the stock? George: You know, every now and then, I have to step back when I read a sentence in the news or I even write a sentence on InsideEVs or for The Atlantic—you know, something like, President Trump holds a White House “summit” full of Teslas, you know, amid widespread protests against Elon Musk, his chief advisor and government cost cutter, that are happening all over the world, including vandalism. And I just stepped back, and I’m like, How did we get here? Like, is someone putting LSD in my coffee every morning? Like, this is just such a baffling, bizarre outcome from the way that Tesla’s trajectory has worked for the longest time and where it’s at now. You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly. When I started covering Tesla, and I was a young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get the Model S up and running. You know, the first car was the Roadster. And that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less. And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems. And he was going, Yeah, we’re working on it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running. And, you know, I still think the Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that. And over time, we covered this guy and his company. It’s like, Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming up with is this really interesting alternative to gas. And I can just say personally, you know, by the end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to gasoline. It’s the future. And that wouldn’t have happened without Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies. He can be very vain, certainly. He’s very obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy” or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye West–like trajectory. It’s like, This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible. And over time, the horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising that power in unprecedented ways. Warzel: So I’ve always been fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human meme stock. So I’m kind of curious: How much do you think Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute force his way into making the future bend to his will? George: I think that the value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he says repeatedly, Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story. And he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that. I’m not sure there is a company in modern times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself. I go back to the early days of Tesla, right? The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a New York Times article about Tesla Motors and what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all. So he always wanted his image to be wrapped up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that audience directly and build up a following directly. And you said the phrase meme stock earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this vibe—I almost want to say grift—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before. Warzel: I think this protest movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said— George: Used to? Warzel: Yeah. And, well, this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day. Even just on a very small scale, if it’s not a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right? Teslas and EVs have always had a political valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future. George: I actually do think that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word polarizing, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s always been a polarizing brand. Like, when it was embraced by liberals and Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, Hey, you have a Tesla. You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh? And now it’s kind of flipped on its head, right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE. Meanwhile, you have Fox News defending him left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking the Teslas en masse. Like, I don’t want to stereotype here, but there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know? So it’s like, Are you for EVs or not? You want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car. You know, like, I have family in deep-red Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, Elon’s the best. He’s great. He’s, you know, cutting government waste. It’s like, Okay, well, would you buy one of his cars? Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came out. And, you know, for those of you who don’t know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out. It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer. All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat. And if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4 rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any potential buyers or fans that they might have once had. Warzel: But at the same time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do you think that is under threat, essentially? George: Yeah. And that’s where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars. When we’re talking about why its value is so high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s been saying since 2016, about. You know, that is the value of the company. That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many miles more experience. Warzel: Yeah, they’re on the roads. George: They’re on the roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day. That’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it. But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue. So he may have these grand dreams of robots and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis. And the other thing I think about, too, is supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here. [Music] Warzel: When we’re back, I ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk. [Break] Warzel: So putting aside Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage, especially in the United States. But it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of it, what does the company have to worry about right now? George: Yeah, let’s start with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say electrification, that means more hybrids and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value. Like, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota, you’re looking at Tesla like, Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify. And it took them years to do it. And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles. Like, this is all we write about at InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging. There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance from cars like Audi now that are electric also. So Tesla started this, but they haven’t been able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3 sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with, like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the West. The other problem is that once they set up shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it. And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more. So with its incredible industrial might, like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like, I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company. Warzel: A big thing that I have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company. The idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers, like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla? George: Not any one thing, but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China. So, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper. Then you have faster charging. Then you have the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way. But, you know, once that happens and one of these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper, I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company. Warzel: Well, and as you’re saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this. George: Certainly busy, but he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork. But if you had a federal framework, and if that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being like, Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars. That’s all boring to say. But the idea is that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis. But that single-minded focus on autonomy and AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not. Warzel: It sounds like a very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like, We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around. George: Been saying this stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah. Warzel: But I think there is also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, This is right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel. Meanwhile, every year that future pushes further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet. George: Yeah. But this speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car. It’s built in a completely different way than cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked. It’s like, Just hit reset on everything, and just do it. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving. Like, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better. Warzel: Those are Tesla features. George: Yeah, of course. Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better. Full self-driving tried to kill me on two separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every single time, in every single scenario. And they’re not there yet. Warzel: What is so difficult to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just, like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering? George: You know, a year ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet. You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving cars. Maybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness. He doesn’t relate to other people well. You know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE. I don’t think he counted on that. I think he thought he would come in and, you know, gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader, and that everything would’ve worked out great, just the way it always has, as he’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are—you know, they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.

(Photo by Justin TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms' stock has declined approximately 13% this year, facing headwinds from potential tariff impacts that could affect the company in two significant ways: Despite this year’s setback, Meta has demonstrated remarkable resilience over a longer timeframe, with the stock gaining 56% since early 2022, substantially outperforming the broader Nasdaq index’s modest 7% increase. As an aside, after a negative reaction to earnings, Is IBM Stock Headed To $170? Meta’s outperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Meta Platforms has delivered impressive revenue growth of 39%, increasing from $118 billion in 2021 to $165 billion in the trailing twelve months. This robust performance stems from multiple growth drivers: Meta's profitability metrics show substantial improvement, with the net income margin expanding from 33.4% in 2021 to 37.9% currently. This enhanced profitability is complemented by a strategic 9% reduction in shares outstanding, made possible by the company's substantial $122 billion investment in share repurchases. The combination of higher revenues, expanded margins, and fewer outstanding shares has resulted in a 73% increase in earnings per share, rising from $13.77 in 2021 to $23.86 in the most recent period. Despite Meta's impressive financial performance across revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings improvement, its P/E ratio has declined by 10%. This valuation compression can be attributed to several factors: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your META stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While META remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies.

April 24, 2025 08:38 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, April 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of purchasers of Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period may, no later than APRIL 28, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch and spacecraft design services. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin now sits on a fortune worth over $100 billion, as the cryptocurrency’s price climbed back above $94,000 this week. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor who disappeared from public view more than a decade ago, holds approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin, according to data from analytics platform Arkham. If Satoshi were a public figure today, their net worth would rank them 16th on Forbes’ list of billionaires worldwide. This would position Bitcoin’s inventor above prominent business personalities such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and computer mogul Michael Dell. The value of these Bitcoin holdings reached a high of $120 billion when Bitcoin hit its all-time high in January before falling during the recent market correction. Perhaps most salient in the wealth of Satoshi is just how little money he has utilized. Studies demonstrate that of what’s estimated as 1.1 million Bitcoins residing in the dormant wallets, merely 907 BTC have actually ever been disbursed. Mining from Satoshi had, by and by, reached its end when the singularly patterned mode of mining labeled as the “Patoshi pattern” closed with block number 54,316 during May 2010. Such a defining technical signature has aided researchers following the early mine works of Satoshi throughout over 22,000 blocks. Bitcoin momentarily traded at $94,400 before settling at a slightly lower price, a monthly high. This is a 25% recovery from its recent fall to $74,400 in the first part of this month, the lowest since November 2024. As the value of Bitcoin rises, long-term holders are watching their investments increase again. Whereas Satoshi’s holdings are still the biggest single Bitcoin hoard, institutional investors are closing in. Bitcoin ETFs collectively now hold almost as much Bitcoin as Satoshi, with total holdings worth about $104 billion. BlackRock is the leading ETF providers with Bitcoin holdings of $50 billion, followed by Grayscale with $17 billion. Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) is still accumulating and now holds 538,200 BTC worth nearly $50 billion. The ongoing absence of the founder of Bitcoin has raised so many questions regarding what happened to this massive cryptocurrency wealth. In its analysis, Whale Alert states Satoshi potentially mined as much as 1,125,150 BTC before he vanished from the Bitcoin world. Whether such coins will ever be moved is still one of the largest cryptocurrency enigmas. Traders keep a close eye on these sleeping wallets since any unusual activity may have a noticeable effect on Bitcoin prices and conceivably give information regarding Satoshi Nakamoto’s whereabouts or identity.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analysts ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 27 January 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on January 27, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has declined approximately 18% this year, largely due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts on its business model. This is particularly significant as Amazon’s marketplace relies heavily on third-party sellers from China, making it vulnerable to import tariff increases. Even if the Trump administration eventually reduces these tariffs, Amazon’s operations may face lasting structural changes. Additionally, broader tariff-driven inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power, further impacting Amazon’s retail sales. Separately, What’s Going On With META Stock? Looking at a longer timeframe reveals an even more concerning picture: since early 2022, Amazon's stock has gained only about 9% over three years. This underperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Amazon has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 36% revenue increase, growing from $470 billion in 2021 to $638 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is driven by several sustainable factors: Amazon's net income margin has improved by approximately 31%, increasing from 7.1% to 9.3% during this period. This margin expansion primarily stems from the increasing contribution of AWS, which operates at substantially higher margins than the retail business. As AWS constitutes a larger percentage of overall revenue, it positively impacts the company's aggregate profit margins. The combination of revenue growth and margin expansion has resulted in a 71% increase in earnings per share, rising from $3.24 in 2021 to $5.53 in the last twelve months. Despite strong operational improvements, Amazon's P/E ratio has contracted by 36% (from 51.5 to 32.7) since 2021, reflecting several investor concerns: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While Amazon remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies.

InfoQ Homepage News Inflection Points in Engineering Productivity for Improving Productivity and Operational Excellence Apr 24, 2025 3 min read by Ben Linders As a company grows, investing in custom developer tools may become necessary. Initially, standard tools suffice, but as the company scales in engineers, maturity, and complexity, industry tools may no longer meet needs, Carlos Arguelles said at QCon San Francisco. Inflection points, such as a crisis, hyper-growth, or reaching a new market, often trigger these investments, providing opportunities for improving productivity and operational excellence. Carlos Arguelles gave a talk about Amazon’s inflection points in engineering productivity. When a company first starts, it doesn’t make sense for it to create its own developer tools, as there are plenty of excellent ones available in the industry, he said. But as a company grows (in number of engineers, in maturity, in customer adoption, in domains), investing in its own developer tools starts making sense: An inflection point is when that investment in engineering productivity that didn’t make sense before now suddenly does. This could be because the industry tools do not scale, or because the internal tools can be optimized to integrate better with the rest of the ecosystem, as Arguelles explained. A little papercut where each developer is wasting a couple of minutes per day in toil can add to hundreds of millions of dollars of lost productivity in a company like Amazon or Google. The more obvious inflection point that made investments in engineering productivity become feasible is the number of engineers. Maybe it didn’t make sense for your company to have its own CI/CD proprietary tooling when there were 3000 engineers, but it does when there are 10,000 engineers, because the savings in developer productivity with a toolchain optimized for the ecosystem have a significant return on investment, Arguelles said. He mentioned that the opposite is true as well. When your company is in hypergrowth it may make sense to have duplicate tools (each organization creating its bespoke tool so that it can independently move fast), but when the company stops growing (which is what happened in 2023 with all the big tech layoffs), it makes sense to consolidate tooling and defragment the world. Arguelles gave some more examples of inflection points, like reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence can provide an inflection point or entering an entirely different and new market. Sometimes the inflection point is a crisis or even a single operational issue that could have been prevented with the right tooling: For example, Amazon invested significantly in a number of load, stress, and chaos testing tools after the Prime Day incident of 2018 (where the Amazon Store was unavailable for hours during the busiest shopping day of the year). We had been talking about doing that for years, but that incident helped us sharpen our focus and build a solid case for funding those investments. Inflections can also happen when an organization experiences hyper-growth: I saw Amazon double in size every year, from 3000 engineers when I started in 2009, to 60k-70k in 2022. What this meant in practice is that we needed to be thinking about skating to where the puck was going to be, not where it currently was. Scaling needs and security needs often meant sooner or later we needed to create our own developer tools, Arguelles said. Over time, they developed tools to scale source code repositories and built their own tools for code reviews and CI/CD (including testing and deployment): Because of that hyperscale, we often found ourselves needing to re-think our architecture much sooner than we had envisioned. But it also provided ample opportunities to innovate and think differently! Inflection points are inevitable and occur naturally in many situations: a company drastically increasing or shrinking in terms of number of engineers, a crisis, reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence, or entering an entirely different and new market, Arguelles said. He concluded that it is important to have your eyes open, recognize when these inflection points are around the corner, proactively shape your engineering productivity tooling for the future, and seize the opportunities.

Title: WealthTech, Retirement And Investing Predictions For 2025 And Beyond

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Investors have faced highly volatile and stressful conditions to start 2025, with considerable stock market losses. The ongoing challenges could encourage investors to consider a different approach for allocating their retirement dollars, including alternative assets. In 2024, demand for alternative investments grew dramatically from retail and institutional investors looking to bolster returns and improve portfolio diversification. Private market asset managers are now pursuing the retail channel, so increased supply and demand are meeting in the middle. In addition, new technology platforms opened access to private markets that previously were only available to the very wealthy. I expect these trends to continue and accelerate in the coming years due to increasing investor education, ongoing stock market uncertainty and changing regulatory conditions. For the typical retail investor, most of their portfolio is in a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA). Most brokers and banks only allow IRA investing in traditional market assets like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. However, investors can use a self-directed IRA custodian to invest their retirement savings in a variety of alternative asset classes, such as private equity, private credit and venture capital. Self-directed IRAs also allow direct investments in cryptocurrencies, which had a moment given the record prices reached by certain coins early this year. I expect the industry to raise more awareness of the different ways to access alternatives in an investment portfolio, including through self-directed IRAs. These accounts can be opened online in minutes. Ultimately, investors want control over their retirement investments, and we’re likely going to see an increase in investors learning how to do so through self-directed IRAs in the years ahead. I expect more traditional industry players, including large retail brokers and financial advisors, to engage with the alts space over the next year as they respond to investor demand. For example, numerous brokers launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024, such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Invesco. Financial advisors are also constantly seeking ways to improve asset allocation and portfolio results for their clients. A KKR study found that a portfolio with an allocation of 40% stocks, 30% bonds and 30% alts had a higher annual return than the standard 60/40 stock and bond portfolio from 1927 to 2021. Financial advisors will shift their recommendations to match new research, but they need help doing so. Brokers and advisors who are new to alts could lean on those specializing in this space, such as the recent partnership between the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association and the Financial Planning Association (FPA), to share educational materials. In the past, the alts sector was mostly a manual process and didn’t leverage technology; think pen and paper and fax machines. While this approach made sense when these investments were only for a few high-net-worth individuals, it no longer works for investors in the digital era. Investors need a uniform platform where they can educate themselves, have access to a range of choices, evaluate decisions and then seamlessly execute investments. Ideally, platforms should be backed by human support. Investors are used to these digital platforms and tools for traditional public market-based assets and will expect them for alts, too. That same technology and digital experience should be easily accessed by financial advisors so they feel comfortable referring it to clients. Ultimately, the companies that engage investors with a user-friendly digital experience are the ones that will be better positioned to grow. Over the last few years, the regulatory landscape has become difficult for fund managers, financial advisors and investors to navigate. Government agencies are targeting the industry with more scrutiny and enforcement. That still holds for the time being. While firms seek opportunities to grow and innovate in the alternative investment space, compliance must remain a priority. Things have been slowly moving in a different direction for alts, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving crypto ETFs, but barriers remain. In addition, if the Fed resumes decreasing interest rates, investor confidence may increase, specifically for private equity and venture capital, leading to increased investment demand. This could create further political pressure from investors to push the regulatory landscape in a different direction. I believe demand for alts will continue to grow as investors realize the potential diversification and investment value of these assets. The industry will adopt more user-friendly wealth tech platforms, both for individual investors and their advisors. While regulatory challenges remain, I am cautiously optimistic that the evolving policy landscape may create a more supportive environment for alternative investments. The coming years should continue expanding access to investment opportunities that were once limited to the ultra-wealthy. Investors exploring alternatives can work with their financial advisors to determine how these options might fit into their long-term retirement planning.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Port of Long Beach. Photo: Shutterstock/DJANA 575 By Bloomberg News Apr 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –For an increasing number of Chinese exporters, many of whom battled through the trade war in President Donald Trump’s first term and who have invested years to capture the spending power of American shoppers, it may be closing time in the US. With tariffs on Chinese imports at 145%, factories that make items like coffee machines and yoga pants have halted shipments to the US and have idled their assembly lines to a three or four day week. And while Trump has indicated that tariffs won’t stay that high on China forever, some fearful exporters are making permanent plans to withdraw from the US market and turn to other regions like the Middle East for sales instead. Exporters are now trying to “survive” the current crisis, said Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents some 3,000 exporters. Businesses are taking steps to generate cash like selling inventory for higher prices, and cancelling warehouse rental agreements in the US, she said. One such exporter is a Guangzhou-based retailer that sells underwear and yoga pants via Amazon, Temu and Shein, which decided to stop shipping any more products to the US earlier this month, and raised prices of some of its most popular products by as much as 30% to generate more cash. “We had some urgent meetings in late March to discuss our next steps. The conclusion was to stop fighting for the US market,” said sales manager Huang Lun. The plight of Chinese exporters mean US consumers could face rising prices and shortages of crucial goods in the coming months. The grim outlook adds to rising bets among economists that the US will enter a recession if the White House doesn’t back down on its tariff threats. China will also endure substantial economic pain. With their largest market on hold, many factories have cut back production to just three or four days per week, said Wang, citing a recent industry survey conducted by the association. With bank loans and worker salaries to pay, there will be a wave of factory closures and worker layoffs in the coming months, she said. Jenny Huang, a salesperson at a Ningbo-based curtain maker, is trying to diversify beyond the US though 90% of its current client base — business that has come to an abrupt halt — is there. The company will only consider exporting to the US again when tariff situation clears up, she says. Until then, it is exploring opportunities elsewhere such as Southeast Asia the Middle East. “When the tariffs were raised to 54%, people already suffered very slim profits but still decided to stay and buy time to explore new markets with the cash flow generated in the US,” said Wang. “But when it was raised to 125% and then 145%, people decided to quit because you’ll die faster if you insist on staying in the US.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitcoin Traders Eye Long Term BTC Accumulation By Selling Put Options

Would you offer insurance when expecting low odds of a claim being made? Most likely, you would, while pocketing the premium without a second thought. Bitcoin (BTC) traders are doing something similar in the Deribit-listed BTC options market, hinting at bullish price expectations. Recently, an increasing number of traders have been selling (writing) BTC put options, likened to providing insurance against price drops in exchange for a small upfront premium. They are implementing this strategy in a cash-secured manner by holding a corresponding amount in stablecoins, ensuring they can buy BTC if the market declines and the put buyer decides to exercise his right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. This strategy enables traders to collect premiums (paid by put buyers) while potentially accumulating bitcoin if the options are exercised. In other words, it's the expression of a long-term bullish sentiment. "There is a notable increase in cash-secured put selling using stablecoins—another sign of a more mature, long-term approach to BTC accumulation and a continued expression of bullish sentiment," Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. Chen said BTC holders are also selling higher strike call options to collect premiums and generate additional yield on top of their coin stash, which is weighing over Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day BTC implied volatility. The index has dropped from 63 to 48 since the April 7 panic selling in BTC to $75K, according to data from the charting platform TradingView. "We observe that investors remain long-term bullish on BTC, particularly among crypto-native “holders” who are willing to hold through market cycles," Chen said. Bitcoin's price has risen to over $92,000 since the early month slide to $75,000, supposedly on the back of haven demand and renewed institutional adoption narrative. The sharp price recovery has seen BTC options risk reversals reset to suggest a bias for call options across time frames, according to data source Amberdata. Over the past two days, traders have specifically snapped up calls at strike $95,000, $100,000 and $135,000 via the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. As of writing, the $100,000 strike call was the most popular option play on Deribit, with a notional open interest of over $1.6 billion. Just how important it is to track flows in the options market can be explained by the fact that the cumulative delta in Deribit's BTC options and options tied to the U.S.-listed BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and its peers was $9 billion as of Wednesday, according to data tracked by Volmex. The data indicates heightened sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, suggesting potential for price volatility. Delta, one of the metrics used by sophisticated market participants to manage risk, measures how much the price (premium) of an options contract is likely to change in response to the $1 chance in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC. So, the cumulative delta of $9 billion represents the total sensitivity of all outstanding BTC and bitcoin ETF options to changes in the spot price. As of Wednesday, the total notional value of all outstanding options contracts was $43 billion. Such large data or sensitivity to price swings in the underlying asset means market makers and traders actively engage in hedging strategies to mitigate their risks. Market makers, or those mandated to provide order book liquidity, are known to add to price volatility through their constant effort to maintain a net directional neutral exposure. "Option deltas have increased to record levels as open interest grew and strike deltas shifted significantly. Option market makers are actively hedging this delta exposure, driven by substantial new positions and notable shifts in strike pricing," Volmex noted on X. According to Volmex, crypto-native options traders over Deribit are positioned more bullishly than those trading options tied to IBIT.

Archives Internal variability effect doped by climate change drove the 2023 marine heat extreme in the North Atlantic, Guinaldo et al., Communications Earth & Environment The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin. Considering the regional distribution of anomalies is crucial for risk assessment in a warming climate. Reply to Pielke (2025), Willoughby et al., Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology: Pielke deprecates both the ICAT database, which he once recommended, and U.S. tropical cyclone (TC) damage estimates from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). We do not share these views. Willoughby et al. (hereafter WL24) is based upon ICAT damage for 1900–2017, both then-year and normalized for inflation, population, and individual wealth, extended to 2022 with National Hurricane Center (NHC) official figures from NCEI. Pielke represents the data of Weinkle et al. (hereafter WK18) as a superior source. We find troubling anomalies in the WK18 data. The issue is that WK18 find that normalized TC damage is constant, but WL24 find that it is increasing. Here, we replicate the WL24 analysis with WK18 data and find a statistically significant growth of then-year damage relative to the U.S. economy, a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the most damaging TCs, and a 0.6% per year increase in TC normalized damage. The last of these is not statistically significant because of the large variance due to the modulation of TC impacts by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Thus, the increase in U.S. TC damage is sufficiently robust to survive the shortcomings of both datasets. Discerning the Elevated Risk of Compound Extreme Heat Stress Followed by Extreme Precipitation Events in the Socially Vulnerable Communities in the Upper Midwest, Khan et al., International Journal of Climatology Compound extreme events have the potential to yield severe socio-economic repercussions. This study delves into compound extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress (CEPHS), an aspect that needs more extensive examination within the compound event framework in the upper Midwestern United States. Results reveal a significant increasing trend in CEPHS occurrences, particularly in Kentucky, lower, central, and northern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, central parts of Missouri, northern parts of Michigan, and western and north-eastern parts of Iowa from 1979 to 2021. Moreover, we observed significantly higher intensities of extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress compared to those occurring independently, predominantly in the central and northern parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio during the same period. Our analysis also underscores a robust association between CEPHS and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. These insights offer valuable implications for flood hazard management strategies under climate change within the region. This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch project (No. ILLU-741-337). British heatwave discourse (1985–2023): from ice cream to armageddon?, van Dooremalen & Smith, Environmental Sociology: How has public discourse about climate change evolved? This paper answers this question through the paradigmatic case of British heatwaves. These are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull weather, making them a least likely case for the emergency of a discourse of doom. With a topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127), we show that a longstanding Romantic heatwave discourse eventually buckled, and that Apocalypticism finally became the dominant genre in the last decade. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates and explains complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive lifestyle implications. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. In connecting the genre perspective from literary theory to big data method topic modelling, our approach is parsimonious, novel and replicable in other national contexts. Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures, Cooper et al., Communications Earth & Environment: River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.

April 23, 2025 18:46 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Investors got hosed when Trump’s tariffs tanked markets. Some of America’s billionaires managed to sell before the plunge

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Many of America’s wealthiest business leaders have lost millions, if not billions, of dollars in net worth since the start of the year, as President Donald Trump’s policies hit markets. But some might have lost even more if they hadn’t offloaded millions of dollars’ worth of stock prior to Trump’s tariff announcement in early April — not necessarily because they knew something the rest of us didn’t, but because the wealthiest investors treat their portfolios somewhat differently than the average investor. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon were among the top 10 stock sellers by value during the first three months of this year, according to data from The Washington Service, which tracks buying and selling by corporate insiders. Together, the top 10 insider sellers sold more than 28 million shares of their companies, worth a combined $3.9 billion, during the first quarter, the data shows. That was before markets took a precipitous drop when Trump announced on April 2 widespread tariff hikes on America’s trading partners. Trump has since flip-flopped on many of those tariff plans, but uncertainty has continued to roil markets. Bloomberg first reported on The Washington Service data. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Catz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Dimon said his sale was pre-planned and disclosed months before. Corporate executives generally offload stock at regularly scheduled intervals, and there’s no indication that the top sellers were looking to get ahead of the tariff announcement. Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales took place during January and February, when Meta shares were mostly trading above $600. As of midday Wednesday, Meta shares (META) were trading around $530, down 11% year-to-date. Related article These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars The decline in Meta’s share price has helped to drag down Zuckerberg’s net worth by nearly $30 billion since the start of this year, as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock. The decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line. That included donating to and attending the president’s inauguration, as well as a $25 million agreement to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library. Catz sold 3.8 million in Oracle shares worth $705 million in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service. Oracle’s stock (ORCL) was down nearly 19% since the start of this year, as of midday Wednesday. JPMorgan’s Dimon sold more than 860,000 shares (JPM) worth $233.8 million in the first quarter. Dimon has warned that a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade policies. The top ten insider sellers based on the value of shares sold in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service, were: Zuckerberg, Catz, Palo Alto Networks CEO Arora Nikesh, Nutanix Director Max de Groen, Axis Capital Holdings Director Charles Davis (sold by Stone Point Capital where Davis is chairman and co-CEO), Palantir President Stephen Cohen, Dimon, Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Dutch Bros Chairman Travis Boersma.

The three-year agreement aims to help increase savings for U.K. households. The Blackrock Foundation, the philanthropic arm of BlackRock Inc., has committed 1.5 million pounds ($2 million) to support Nest Insight, a public-benefit research and innovation center in the U.K. The foundation reported the three year-partnership agreement will focus on using BlackRock’s Emergency Savings Initiative, launched in 2019, to help boost savings and improve financial security for millions of British households. The Emergency Savings Initiative is funded with $50 million and has the goal of spurring “innovation that enables people to establish a stronger financial safety net.” According to the foundation, the collaboration aims to work with regulators and support employers to launch more opt-out savings plans for U.K. workers. According to Nest Insight, its recent research demonstrates that an “opt-out approach to saving could make a significant impact on the UK’s savings gaps.” Its research found that approximately 25% of adults in the U.K. have less than 100 pounds in savings, and its opt-out pilot program indicated that 70% of workers are beginning to save. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  An opt-out approach involves employees being automatically enrolled in a savings account through payroll contributions unless they choose to opt out. The foundation’s research indicated that workers save more if they are required to request unenrollment from a savings program, rather being required to sign up for one, the foundation reported. “If they want to start saving, they don’t need to do anything,” the Nest Insight stated. “Everything is done for them. Only people who don’t want to save have to take action.” Related Stories: U.K. Nest Pension Auto Enrollment Remains ‘Robust’ With Assets at $11.2B, UK’s Nest to Make Domestic Investments More Transparent Nest to Acquire 10% Stake in IFM Investors in Alts Buildout Tags: BlackRock, BlackRock Foundation, Emergency Savings Initiative, Nest Insight « Moody’s, MSCI to Launch Private Credit Risk Modelling Tool

Title: Nvidia, other chipmakers jump on eased tariff concerns

Chip stocks were among the market leaders on Wednesday thanks to President Donald Trump’s statement the day before that tariffs on China “will come down substantially,” as well as vote of confidence by famed investor Cathie Wood. Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought up stock in several chipmakers on Tuesday, including $1.1 million shares of Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday, Nvidia jumped more than 5%, approaching its 21-day moving average. Palintir Technologies (PLTR) also had a strong performance Wednesday, rising more than 7%, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shot up by 10.2% during the day, AMD (AMD) rose 8.1%, Micron (MU) jumped 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO) more than 7%. Although semiconductors and other electronics are currently exempt from steep U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, administration officials have said those exemptions are temporary, and tariffs would probably be imposed on the sector in a month or two. Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

Title: Google earnings are coming Thursday. Here's what to watch

Time Published: 2025-04-23T19:38:00Z
Full Content:
Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet will report first-quarter 2025 earnings Thursday after the bell in what could be a key test for the Nasdaq, given the company’s heavyweight status on the index. The company’s stock has fallen about 16% so far this year, so investors will be tuning in to Thursday’s earnings call to gauge how exactly how confident Google’s leadership is about the company’s future, particularly in the key areas of AI and cloud computing, and amid a host of legal concerns related to antitrust cases. The shares were up slightly in Thursday morning trading, about 1.3%. Google is expected to report Q1 revenue growth of $89.2 billion (an 11% year-over-year increase) and earnings per share of $2.02 (7% ). Despite the company’s dip in stock price over the past year, Wall Street analysts largely remain optimistic about Google’s future. The consensus? Its core business fundamentals are strong. Still, lingering uncertainties have led some big firms to lower price targets ahead of Thursday’s call. ​Top analysts, such as those at TD Cowen (TD), UBS (UBS), and Scotiabank (BNS), have adjusted their 12-month price targets for Alphabet. TD Cowen reduced its target from $210 to $195, while UBS lowered its from $209 to $173, and Scotiabank dropped its from $232 to $200. But despite these more cautious outlooks, all three firms maintain a “buy” rating on the stock. RBC Capital (RY) analyst Brad Erickson said in a report that institutional investors have lowered their expectations: “We believe buy side is expecting a (2%-3%) miss, respectively, relative to sell-side estimates of 9% search growth and 8% overall ad growth in Q1.” Google is dealing with a host of swirling questions that analysts are taking into consideration: rising legal risks, trade war and tariff uncertainty, and increasing competition in AI and cloud computing. For investors, the first-quarter earnings report could be a moment of truth: a chance to reset expectations and refocus on the long-term potential of a $1.9 trillion Silicon Valley giant navigating turbulent waters. Google has gotten plenty of headlines lately as it wades its way through a variety of antitrust lawsuits. The search engine giant was back in court this week, related to a ruling that found the company has an illegal monopoly in online search — in part by paying web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to feature its search engine. And the DOJ told the judge it had an eyebrow-raising solution: forcing the company to sell its popular Chrome browser. Google faces other mounting issues that have put the company in an especially vulnerable position. In a separate antitrust case, a federal judge ruled that the company had illegally maintained a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology, which could result in regulatory fines or structural changes to how Google’s ad business operates — and maybe even a break-up. And Japan’s FTC recently sent the company a cease-and-desist order after it said Google’s search practices were monopolistic. On Thursday, analysts will watch closely for any mention of these legal challenges and for what the company’s strategy is for dealing with them beyond what the company has already said — that they’ll appeal. One key feature of Google’s earnings report will likely be how the company has integrated and improved its AI offerings, especially among increased competition in the realm. Investors will look at how the company’s Gemini AI model has been integrated across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud — and at how the AI will start generating substantial revenue. Jeffries analysts said that Google Cloud is “well positioned to benefit from Gemini AI advances” as the cloud computing suite remains a bit of a highlight for the company. Analysts expect Q1 Google Cloud revenue of almost $12 billion, up 25% year-over-year and slightly below both the Street’s expectation ($12.3 billion) and Q4’s growth rate (30%). However, Google Cloud is still playing catch-up to rivals such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN) and Microsoft Azure (MSFT). Google has positioned Google Cloud as an AI-first platform, so as more businesses adopt AI technologies, Google hopes to position its software as the go-to provider. If this quarter’s earnings show significant cloud growth, it could signal a breakthrough moment. Analysts will be closely watching for any signs that this strategy has begun to pay off. And analysts will be looking at AI search competition, too, which JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth said in a report “remains front and center given the rapidly growing scale of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s more measured pace in disrupting its own search ecosystem.” Google’s advertising business remains the biggest component of the company’s revenue, so investors will look at those numbers to shed light on the current state of the digital advertising market. YouTube and Google Search, the pillars of the company’s ad revenue, are expected to show growth. Analysts predict YouTube’s ad revenue will rise nearly 11% to almost $8 billion. But the company has big hopes for expansion in YouTube Shorts monetization. If it becomes a significant revenue stream, it could help offset any potential slowdown in traditional ad revenue. Analysts remain cautious. Legal challenges, including the recent ruling in federal court that found Google guilty of illegally dominating the market in ad servers and exchanges, could have big implications.

April 23, 2025 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Shareholders who purchased shares of APP during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/applovin-corporation-loss-submission-form/?id=144432&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Title: Amazon Stock’s $200 Billion Tariff Hit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/23/amazon-stocks-200-billion-tariff-hit/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T16:52:07Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HANOVER, GERMANY - MARCH 31: The AWS Amazon Web Services pavilion stands are seen at the 2025 ... More Hannover Messe industrial trade fair on March 31, 2025 in Hanover, Germany. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Think AI spending is Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) biggest risk? Think again. The real time bomb is tariffs - and it’s already ticking. Amazon hauls in over $400 billion in retail-related revenue every year. And here’s the kicker: roughly 25% of its cost of goods sold comes from China. Now layer on Trump’s renewed tariffs and suddenly you’re staring at a $6.5 billion operating income hit that could erase almost $200 billion in market cap, based on Amazon’s current 30x multiple. Tariffs will hit Amazon where it hurts most: razor-thin retail margins. And it doesn’t stop there. If consumers balk at price hikes, Amazon’s pricing power erodes. If sellers bail, Prime loses its edge. If margins compress further - while the company pours billions into AI with no proven ROI - the entire bull case starts to wobble. We warned about this in our recent piece: Amazon Stock to Crash to $120? Tariffs are the spark. AI overspend is the fuel. And if you’re still all-in on Amazon stock, it might be time to rethink. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s unpack the damage by the numbers. Amazon sells everything but it doesn’t make everything. It sources much of its inventory and enables a third-party ecosystem that’s deeply reliant on Chinese manufacturing. With the tariff war escalating with China, Amazon’s cost base is now exposed in a major way. Amazon lives and dies by its value proposition. That makes it terrible at passing on cost increases. But it has to, to some degree. CEO Andy Jassy himself admitted that “Prices will likely rise” due to tariffs - a rare public concession of pricing pressure. But let’s be clear: Amazon will eat much of these costs. Unlike niche DTC brands or retailers with premium margins, Amazon competes on price, and every dollar it fails to pass through is a direct hit to margins. Let’s do the math based on Amazon’s 2024 financials Now assume: Does it look small? Think again. That’s a $200 billion decline in stock value. Market Cap Hit > $200 Billion Just 1% decline in operating margin reduces Amazon’s value by $200 billion based on prevailing P/EBIT multiple of almost 30x. That’s >10% of current market cap. Just double that margin hit, which is quite possible (remember reciprocal tariffs are at a ridiculous number now) and you are easily looking at 20-25% downside. But that’s not all. Guess what? When expectations fall, multiples shrink. Amazon’s current market multiples inherently imply that investors expect margin expansion. And when that does not happen - and in fact margins go down - what do you think is going to happen? Big funds will dump Amazon, and multiples will contract. The actual downside could be much higher! It is not outrageous to say that Amazon can fall even as low as $120. Just look at the history - market doesn’t care how good the business is. This is why we diversify away stock-specific risks with Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Going On With Netflix Stock?

More Martin, Matt Duffer, Kate Trefry, Sonia Friedman, Bela Bajaria, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Blair Fetter attend Stranger Things: The First Shadow - Broadway Opening Night at Marquis Theatre on April 22, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Netflix) The market is a mess. April has already seen the S&P 500 tumble nearly 6%, and most high-flying tech names are getting dragged down with it. Except one. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is up a jaw-dropping 11.6% this month. Yes, you read that right. While the broader market is coughing up gains, Netflix is popping champagne. And this kind of divergence is exactly why we don’t bet the farm on any one stock. Because when single names zig while everything else zags, the upside can be thrilling - but the risk? Blistering. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these exact stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So what’s going on? Let’s dig in and check whether this red-hot rally is actually justified or is it about to hit the pause button? Call it earnings magic or just really good timing, but Netflix did well in Q1 2025. Here are the numbers that got Wall Street giddy: And all this as the rest of tech stumbles around blaming tariffs and macro gloom. Netflix? They’re cruising. The company pulled this off by raising prices (again), expanding its advertising tier with in-house tech, and - believe it or not - finally making live content and sports work. This is the part where people start whispering about Netflix being a “tariff-proof haven.” They’re not entirely wrong - Netflix doesn’t sell sneakers or iPhones. No China imports. No tariff drama. Just subscription dollars rolling in. Let’s not sugarcoat this: Netflix stock is expensive at a P/E ratio of 45 and P/EBIT ratio of just under 40. That’s certainly above where most value investors feel cozy. If you are saying - “well that’s fine, Netflix has been a high PE stock for years” - you’d be half right. Think again. In 2022 when inflation hit - guess where Netflix P/E landed? It hit rock bottom of 15x! That’s even lower than what most mature companies get. Simply put - there is ample room for multiple contraction. When that happens, stocks crater. PE is a sensitive metric. It is fueled by expectations. Sure things look good for now because Netflix is executing. Margins are up. Growth is still good. And it’s one of the few mega-cap names that doesn’t have to worry about tariffs, supply chains, or China risk. Investors are looking for safe havens in a shaky macro environment. Right now, Netflix is playing the part equivalent to gold. But you can’t ignore the price tag. This is a stock that assumes Netflix will keep crushing it. Is that possible? Sure. Is it guaranteed? Absolutely not. And here is some data as caution: Netflix is a rare beast in today’s market: a growth stock that’s not just surviving but thriving. But thriving doesn’t come cheap. With a P/E of 45 and little room for missteps, Netflix may be one earnings miss or subscriber slip away from a sharp reality check. The risk here isn’t about Netflix falling apart - it's about the market’s sky-high expectations crashing down to earth. And that’s the problem with chasing single-stock hype: when they win, it’s exhilarating. But when they stumble? Painful. Considering multiples in context of growth is one of the factors we look at in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Happening With Palantir Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. POLAND - 2024/11/21: In this photo illustration, the Palantir company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) S&P is down 6% in April. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is up 11%? That’s not bullish. That’s bizarre, considering the numbers you see when you lift the curtain. Tariffs are hammering tech, semiconductors are shaking, growth stocks are bleeding, and Palantir - a stock trading at PE multiple of 700 is rising? Either we’re witnessing brilliance or a bubble inflating before our eyes. And bubbles pop. When they do, you don’t want to be left holding nothing. This is why investing in a single stock, no matter how lucrative, can be very risky. We diversify away that risk while being exposed to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break Palantir down. It’s not fundamentals driving this. It’s euphoria supercharged by three powerful story lines: [1] AI Buzz = Investor Sugar High Palantir calls itself an “AI company” now. That label alone triggers algos and retail fear-of-missing-out. Still, AI hype alone can send any ticker vertical. Just ask C3.ai - that reached highs of $180+ before falling to a mere $10. [2] Insane Momentum: The Stock is Up Almost 700% in 3 Years Palantir has returned 686% in the past 3 years. That’s the kind of move that breaks valuation anchors. People stop asking “what’s it worth?” and start asking “how high can it go?” [3] Retail Crowd Favorite Palantir is a retail darling - with a CEO (Alex Karp) who talks like a philosopher and a cult-like following that sees it as the next Palantir-for-planet-earth operating system. But sentiment isn’t a moat. And it isn’t a reason to buy. Palantir bulls love to talk about potential. But here’s what the data actually says: There are times to ride such momentum, but in the case of Palantir, that time is gone. Valuation multiples mean something. Evaluating multiples in the context of growth and margin expansion is one of the factors we consider in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Stock Photo: apiguide/Shutterstock SINGAPORE, April 23 (Reuters) – Singapore’s PSA International is exploring the sale of its 20% stake in CK Hutchison‘s ports business, two people with knowledge of the matter said, joining the Hong Kong conglomerate in its controversial plans to sell. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison announced last month it would sell its 80% holding in the business which includes two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to a BlackRock-led consortium. The holding has an equity value of $14.2 billion. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as a “reclaiming” of the canal. Chinese state media, however, have criticized it as a betrayal of China’s interests and the country’s market regulator has launched an antitrust review. Whether PSA, a ports operator wholly owned by Singapore state investor Temasek, ultimately decides to sell will depend on whether CK Hutchison goes ahead with the transaction, the two people said. CK Hutchison and the BlackRock-led consortium have agreed to exclusive talks for 145 days. The people, who were not willing to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, declined to comment on a potential sale price for PSA’s stake. PSA declined to comment. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal between CK Hutchison and the BlackRock consortium encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $22.8 billion. Overall the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal. PSA bought its 20% stake for $4.4 billion in 2006 and has looked at selling previously. Reuters reported in late 2022 that PSA weighed a potential sale. But the two sources said it put the process on hold months later after global shipping activity weakened. Outside of its stake in CK Hutchison, PSA has 70 terminals in 45 countries, including its two flagship ports in Singapore and Belgium, according to its website.

Title: Tariff optimism spurs rally on Wall Street

Update font size. Reset Wall Street’s major indexes surged to one-week highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism for a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war and President Donald Trump’s softened stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Hopes of talks between Washington and Beijing, amid the tariff conflict, boosted market sentiment following a Wall Street Journal report quoting a senior White House official, who suggested U.S. tariffs on China could drop to around 50%-60%. President Trump said on Tuesday of China, “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” and that tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” He also told reporters he would be “very nice” in negotiations with Beijing and that if China does not agree to a trade deal, “the U.S. will set the terms.” Reuters: ‎ Stocks extended gains after the report, building on early momentum after Trump said on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, walking back on his comment that the Fed chair’s termination could not come “fast enough” that had drawn heavy criticism. Markets welcomed the change in the president’s tone. Trump’s criticism of the Fed chair had fueled concerns about the central bank’s autonomy, leading to sharp losses in U.S. assets, including stocks and the dollar, earlier in the week. Megacap tech stocks rose broadly, with Nvidia gaining 5.1%. Apple and Meta Platforms rose 3.6% and 6.7%, respectively… The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 12 new lows. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Axing Jerome “Months Late” Powell, Mr. Transitory, before his end date on May 15, 2026 would be a good thing for Wall Street, but the economy and the stock market will survive 12 months of yet another feckless, often-wrong Fed Chair. As we wrote in February 2023, “When certain quarters, including the Fed, delude themselves and others that ‘inflation is transitory’ and waste at least a year before doing a mere portion of what is necessary* (interest rate hikes), the price will be paid for being delusional and late.” ‘Tis best to get a handle on inflation, if you know how, while you still can. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2021 *Stop the misguided crusade against domestic energy production and profligate federal spending and inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks. It’s not difficult. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2022 For new generations, sometimes tough lessons have to be retaught and learned the hard way. As we go through this, remember: It’s always darkest before the dawn. – MacDailyNews, July 14, 2022 After drifting around aimlessly for far too long on the U.S.S. Transitory, the delusional Fed is laughably too little, too late.

Title: Nvidia investors should watch out for this key risk that could trigger a double-digit semiconductor stock plunge in the next 12 months

It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year. If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan. In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%. While most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released. "President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing," Papic and Gertken wrote. "That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade." Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy. Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers," Yardeni wrote in a note last week. "President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy." BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months. Taiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies. In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed "WWIII," expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. "Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification," Papic and Gertken wrote. In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500. Investors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe. "Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event," wrote Papic and Gertken. "For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices." As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said. "Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap," they wrote. Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU). Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

Title: Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

Title: Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus.

Wicklow Kieran had been visiting the city every weekend to find the Skoda, misplaced after a stag weekend Kieran has spent every weekend since April 4 traipsing the streets of Cork looking for his car. Photo: Tristan O'Connor We’ve all been there, you’ve parked your car and gone away, only to come back not to realise where it is. However, have you ever come back to find your car wasn’t parked in the same neighbourhood that you thought you’d parked it in? Or have you ever considered ringing a local radio station in an attempt to find your motor? That’s exactly what happened to Kieran, who lost his car in the suburbs of Cork City after attending a stag party almost three weeks ago. Driving down from his native Wicklow, Kieran parked his Carlow-registered Skoda Superb in a housing estate within a 30-minute walk from the city centre earlier this month but could not remember where he left it, admitting it has been a “nightmare” and “the stupidest thing I’ve ever done”. He was in regular contact with the gardaí, had visited the impound yard and returned to Cork every weekend since April 4 in an attempt to track down his car. “I had a stag party in Cork and I got into the city late at night and I couldn’t find anywhere to park in the city, I got fed up of it and I drove like, way out of the city towards the south of the city,” he told the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork’s RedFM. "I’m not too sure how far I drove out, but I parked up in an estate and since then, I haven’t laid an eye on the car since. I just can’t find the estate where I left the car.” Kieran said it was his “first time ever having a night out in Cork” and he had “great craic” but when it was time to return home on Sunday morning, he could not remember where his car was parked. He said he was rushing at the time and he struggled to recall any landmarks that could help him with his search. "One of the boys stayed back with me and we drove around Cork, we were the guts of five hours driving around Cork, through estates and looking for this car. I put so much hours into finding this car, it’s actually the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. It’s just been a nightmare,” he said. His recent trip to Cork last weekend took him through “59 estates exactly” on his search. Kieran has spent every weekend since April 4 traipsing the streets of Cork looking for his car. Photo: Tristan O'Connor Today's News in 90 seconds - 23rd April 2025 "I took a name of every estate we were in. We were the whole day doing it,” he said. Kieran said the gardaí were “really helpful and really nice about it”, adding that they were “very professional about it, in fairness to them” when asked whether they found it funny that he had misplaced his car. He worked through what he could remember on air and the roads he took during his walk, adding that it has been a “nightmare”. The Wicklow man said it would “be the dream” for a local resident listening to the programme to identify the car. "I could put this to bed and get on with my life,” he said, adding that he would be prepared to give them a €200 reward “just to say thanks” for their help. The distance between the Boreenmanna Road and Tory Top Road. Source: Google Maps "I’m going to trust the good people of Cork. It’s the least I could do if they could find it, I’d be so grateful.” He said he was “obviously getting a load of abuse about it” from his friends, but that they have also been “so good to him” and have offered him lifts while his car was missing. Listeners to the show found the vehicle within minutes of his plea going out on air, with local woman Susan Maguire spotting the Skoda on Tory Top Road in Ballyphehane. All’s well that ends well for the slightly confused Kieran, who will finally be reunited with his Skoda, 19 days later, albeit his challenge now is to remember how to get out of the city and back to Wicklow. Sinn Féin TD for Wicklow John Brady is to chair the high profile Public Accounts Committee (PAC), with former PAC chair Mairead Farrell to chair the Finance Committee.

Title: Elon Musk Gets $10 Billion Richer As Tesla Stock Rallies On ‘Mea Culpa’ —Despite Brutal Earnings

Time Published: 2025-04-23T13:50:41Z
Full Content:
The world’s richest person got much richer Wednesday as shares of Elon Musk’s car company Tesla soared following the company’s first-quarter earnings update—which offered little encouragement in its traditional financial results, but gave investors what they long yearned for: Musk recommitting to Tesla after months of paying his near undivided attention to the White House. Elon Musk attends a White House cabinet meeting in February. Musk’s net worth climbed $7.5 billion to $369.2 billion Wednesday, according to our latest calculations, extending his lead over the next wealthiest person, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to $170 billion. The spike came as shares of Tesla shot up 5% to $251 in response to its late Tuesday Q1 report, which was ugly by most metrics, as profits and revenues both came in below consensus forecasts at multiyear lows. Tesla certainly got a boost from a broader rally tied to President Donald Trump’s relenting on his China trade standoff and his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell – the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 3% – but the rally largely came as Musk confirmed his dedication to Tesla. “Mea culpa Elon” was the tone struck by the Tesla chief on the earnings call, remarked Evercore ISI analysts led by Chris McNally, as Musk said he’ll be “allocating far more” of his time to the company starting next month. That was music to the ears of many investors and analysts who had expressed concerns about the extensive time Musk spent as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – and the associated damage to Tesla’s brand as Musk’s outspoken politics rubbed many potential customers the wrong way. In addition to Musk’s rededication to Tesla, also helping catalyze the stock rally were the confirmation of June launch plans for the driverless “robotaxi” and the beginning of production of lower-cost electric vehicles during the first half of this year, according to Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so,” Musk said during Tuesday’s earnings call. Musk described Tesla as the “least affected car company” by Trump’s tariffs, but the senior advisor to the president again made clear he disagrees with Trump on his signature trade policy. “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity,” said Musk, continuing the tariff “decision is fundamentally up to” Trump. “So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” shrugged Musk. Tesla stock is still down almost 40% year-to-date, far worse than the S&P 500’s 8% decline as Trump’s oft-changing tariffs led to increased concerns of a recession. Musk donated $288 million toward Trump election causes, making him the largest political donor of the 2024 election cycle. Musk’s role as the head of DOGE, in which he oversaw cost-cutting efforts including mass federal government layoffs, brought significant backlash to Tesla, as sales slumped globally as protests and vandalism spread. In addition to his roles at DOGE and Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of aerospace giant SpaceX, generative AI startup xAI and several other companies. Tesla faced a “code red” situation if Musk didn’t recommit to the company, warned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ahead of earnings. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Activate your online access Even the self-described feminists celebrating the Supreme Court’s attempt to banish trans people from womanhood will pay a heavy price. Trans rights supporters march in London after the UK Supreme Court’s anti-trans ruling. The UK Supreme Court’s transphobic ruling on the definition of “woman” last week is a defeat for all women—even, ultimately, the self-described feminists celebrating it, and the women who will gain in the short term from their alliance with the carceral state. Following the ruling, J.K. Rowling, the world’s richest author and perhaps its most prominent transphobe, tweeted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and a bourbon on her $15 million superyacht, toasting what she called “TERF VE Day,” in reference to the acronym “trans-exclusionary radical feminism” and the surrender of German military operations that heralded “Victory in Europe” 80 years ago. “I love it when a plan comes together,” Rowling added. Rowling had a very particular reason to celebrate; she personally bankrolled the legal campaign by the anti-trans group For Women Scotland that led to the Supreme Court decision. But she was not alone; all over the world, Rowling’s fellow cisfeminist activists popped champagne and congratulated themselves on “reality winning,” imagining themselves, too, perhaps, to be victorious powers in World War II, triumphant over fascism. Try as they might to wrap themselves in the antifascist flag, though, these activists are hailing a decision that represents a ghoulish culmination of fascistic “family values” agitation in women’s name—something it achieves by stomping on a tiny, ultra-vulnerable minority. This is nothing new, either; for over two decades, at the highest levels of Britain’s state and cultural establishment, the articulation of cissexist policy has flowed not only from antifeminist politicians’ lips but also from trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs), who have used every conceivable queerphobic and fascist trope against trans women—pervert, groomer, pedophile, fetishist, rapist, barbarian, deceiver, interloper, parasite—to achieve their end. The Supreme Court’s 88-page judgment declares that trans women whose affirmed gender had been legally recognized by the UK government will no longer be considered women under existing equality laws. Suddenly, in other words, the document that someone living in that country has used for the past 21 years to secure the state’s recognition of their (changed) sex—“for all purposes”—no longer applies in many segregated contexts such as sports, hospital wards, and university accommodation. It no longer protects trans dignity on public boards, either, which is what the For Women Scotland appeal was originally about: The court, in its own words, was considering “whether the appointment of a trans woman with a GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] counts as the appointment of a woman.” Last Wednesday, Lord Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court, announced that no, trans women don’t count. Trans people make up roughly half a percent of Britain’s population, and only a tiny fraction of them—about 9,000—have acquired the aforementioned certificate since it was made available in 2004 following the passage of the country’s Gender Recognition Act. But the ruling now elevates them to the status of an existential threat. Astonishingly, the ruling specifies that what it calls “women living in the male gender”—i.e., trans men, and cis women whose appearance is deemed masculine—“could also be excluded” alongside cis men, from women’s spaces. “Not being allowed into the mens by rule does not mean you have the right to go into the ladies,” clarified the leading anti-trans campaigner Maya Forstater; “That may seem unfair, but these are life choices people make. If you make extreme efforts to look like a man don’t be surprised if you are denied entrance to ladies.” Forstater’s comments underscore the ultimate goal of TERFs and other transphobes: to expunge trans people from public life. Predictably, the all-white, majority-male panel of judges, who heard from no trans people or groups at all in connection with the case, insist that their destruction of trans women’s legal standing qua women vis-à-vis the UK Equality Act is not a defeat for the trans community at all. Trans people in Britain are still protected as trans people by a separate provision in the Equality Act, so the apologists argue; thus, no one loses. But given that institutions are already scrambling to impose penalties on all and any persons suspected of trespassing on the “wrong” side of sex-segregated facilities—if for whatever reason they cannot, or will not, provide proof of assigned sex at birth—it’s unclear to me if anyone really believes this. The fact, already now, is this: If I am perceived not to be what I say I am, and I don’t have the relevant documents, I can be strip-searched by male transport police, and legally barred from single-sex spaces. Trans people will, of course, continue to live lives of authenticity, but make no mistake: Everyone’s bodily autonomy is curtailed (especially those of us who, cis or trans, are poor, undocumented, racialized, intersex, gender non-conforming) by the cisfeminist diktat against non-cis humanity’s existence in public. The decades-long coordinated attack on trans rights paves the way for the unraveling of the Equality Act as a whole, and the dismantling of every (limited but important) legislative gain for social justice achieved since 1998’s explosive “Lawrence Inquiry” into institutional and police racism in the UK. The playbook is now all set to merge with the American one “defending women against gender ideology extremism” (per the White House’s executive order of January, which seeks to make human sexuation, as it were, great again). Hitherto, to suggest as much has typically incurred incandescent indignation on the part of feminism’s Brexiteers—the self-styled anti-woke left-liberal single-issue cissexists whose reactionary brand has long been hegemonic in the UK. This camp has long promoted itself as profoundly un-American. But, increasingly, its hatred of the Black, abolitionist, gender-abundant, utopian international left supersedes its patriotism, leading it to align itself with MAGA (unlikely inheritor of the “true” feminism the left abandoned) without shame. The rationale offered for the retraction of trans people’s right to be men and women in society (rather than un-men and un-women) boils down to the word “biology.” Yet the word does not appear in the Equality Act, and the judge explicitly declines to define it, declaring that the “biological characteristics” corresponding to the “plain and unambiguous words [‘man’ and ‘woman’] are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation.” As the archivist Morgan Page summarized it acidly, “apparently the UK Supreme Court will know women when they see them,” this being the litmus test for pornography put forward by the US Supreme Court in the 1960s. The comparison to obscenity law is no idle one. “Deep in the judgment,” noted the barrister Dave Renton, “is an idea of trans people as moral contaminants.” For half a century, the drive to purify womanhood of perversity has indeed undergirded the minority branch of Anglo American women’s liberationism that, in 2008, was dubbed “TERF.” (A better label than “TERFism,” in my view, would have been “cisfeminism” or “cultural feminism,” since there really is nothing radical about the ideology, even though it is feminist.) One lurid antecedent of the feminist misogyny—yes!—at the heart of TERFism is the ecofeminist theologian Mary Daly’s femmephobic 1978 screed Gyn/Ecology: the Meta-Ethics of Radical Feminism, which pours infinitely more contempt on femininity and “artificiality” than it does on patriarchy. Expounded via lynch mob–esque interventions in lesbian spaces by figures like Sheila Jeffreys in England and Robin Morgan in the United States, this fringe feminism was considered reactionary by most radical feminists already in 1973. Preferring the term “gender-critical,” 21st-century TERFs have protested for years that TERF is a misogynistic slur; still, the more of British society they’ve captured, the more they’ve grown content with the moniker. “Welcome to Team TERF,” gloats UnHerd every time an A-lister turns transphobe. “2023 is the year of the TERF,” declares the far-right rally Let Women Speak. “We will fight,” jokes Rowling in another revealing effort to claim Churchillian glory for her cause, “on the beaches of TERF Island.” The copious “strong borders” imagery readily reveals TERFism to be a female cultural nationalism or sexual nationalism, premised—Brexit-style—on the securitization of the tacitly white and innocent body politic against dysgenic gender “refugees.” The pogrom-inciting tenor of what has been called “the trans debate” was normalized from the get-go by feminism’s moral alibi and the nepotism of Britain’s commentariat class. The hyper-respectability of many of its ringleaders surely didn’t hurt, either. Helen Joyce, one of the most influential trans-annihilationists currently heralding the Supreme Court decision as a personal win, is a former editor at The Economist. Her buddy the celebrity anti-trans philosopher Kathleen Stock is a royally honored academic. Rowling, of course, is a national treasure. Meanwhile, the publishing industry has glutted itself on trans-“skeptic” books just asking questions—not just by Joyce and Stock—and these all receive rave reviews in the UK Guardian. (Back in 2018, the US office of that newspaper was even moved to denounce its British counterpart over its participation in the self-styled “feminist” moral panic.) The riddle of “TERF Island” continues to intrigue those international onlookers who intuit feminism and transphobia to be opposites. Unlike the supposedly very different—crassly “polarized” and “partisan”—makeup of the American fight for trans rights, in Britain it’s a point of pride that genteelly genocidal anti-gender-ism cuts across Conservative, Labour, and feminist milieus. (Right on cue, the Labour government hailed the Supreme Court decision, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “really pleased” with the “clarity” it provided, and his spokesperson saying that Starmer no longer believes that trans women are women.) Hearteningly, on Saturday, the UK also saw widespread gigantic anti-TERF protests of the Supreme Court decision, suggesting some degree of popular rejection of the cissexist “common sense” that was explicitly deployed in the court. This epistemic pseudo-realism that we nowadays so often see violently invoked by figures as superficially disparate as J.K. Rowling and D.J. Trump—on matters ranging from woman-definition to immigration—is, to borrow from the historian Ann Stoler, a colonial common sense. This is also paradoxically why TERFism, like all fascist discourses and all imperial and settler-colonial horizons, imagines itself upside-down, as somehow preyed-upon, bullied, colonized, and at risk of genocidal erasure at the hands of the subjugated group it dehumanizes. More pressing matters than metaphysical and/or state recognition of one’s sex often preoccupy individuals in the trans community. The core scourges of trans life in the UK include: poverty, medical under-service, labor market exclusions, sexual violence, housing discrimination, and a media climate of brutal mockery, scapegoating, and stigma. Conversely, in the baseless narrative propagated via the British establishment’s long-standing hate fest around trans-ness, trans women constitute a powerful, sinister sexual threat to ladies, lesbians, and little boys and girls, all of whom are at the mercy of this phantasmic social plague of predatory and fetishistic “men” brandishing pieces of paper that falsely declare them female so as to access “single-sex spaces” where they don’t belong and carry out all manner of evil. (Trans men were usually, until now, an afterthought in TERF politics: harmless at best, traitors to womankind at worst. Thanks to For Women Scotland, though, they might not be able to legally pee in public at all.) In the multifaceted fight against fascism ahead of us, many voices will be raised to re-explain at length, again and again, why trans women are women and trans men are men. Debunking the bad sexological science that well-spoken eugenicists like Helen Joyce propound is certainly a worthwhile task, since it often dazzles the uninitiated and gives pause to the uncertain. But the more important priority, for my money, remains the refusal of TERFs’ very terrain of argument. Elie Mystal Jeet Heer Sophie Lewis Elie Mystal Feminism does not, and has never, in fact, required a definition of “woman.” To the contrary, while “enemy feminisms” (as I call them) have repeatedly attempted to ontologize and naturalize sex, other feminisms, over the centuries, have pursued the struggle against sexual hierarchy as an all-encompassing utopian endeavor whose present and future constituencies are necessarily moot: Much of revolutionary feminism, for example, remains agnostic about whether “women” will definitely exist after patriarchy, especially given how many female subjects—Indigenous, enslaved, disabled, queer, sex-working—have been excluded from womanhood in the past. Cisness brutalizes us all. The border guards of sex are the enemies of human liberation, and we fight them best by refusing to debate the fairness, let alone the accuracy, of their borders in the first place. “Womanhood is not assigned. It is lived, sacred, and sovereign,” as the joint statement by the Muslim-led feminist Transfuturist and Ad’iyah collectives following the Supreme Court ruling reminds us. “We do not and will never recognize the authority of any government court or institution to determine our legitimacy. They do not know us—and they can never name us.” Update: This piece originally said that the Supreme Court panel that issued the ruling was all-male. In fact, it was majority-male. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

ARK 21Shares leads Bitcoin ETF inflow surge with $267 million on record-setting day. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States witnessed their largest single-day net inflow since President Donald Trump returned to office in January. According to data from SpotOnChain, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $912.7 million on April 22. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) led with $267 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $253 million, while BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) added $193 million. Meanwhile, IBIT also saw intense trading activity on the day. Bitcoin analyst TraderT reported that the fund saw over $4 billion in volume on the day, making it one of the most-traded ETFs in the US market. Market analysts attribute the spike to a shift in investor sentiment, driven by broader market volatility and evolving macroeconomic conditions. The strong inflows suggest that institutional and retail players are once again turning to Bitcoin as a store of value amid economic uncertainty. Ethereum-focused ETFs also posted a positive turnaround after nine consecutive sessions of weak or negative flows. On April 22, these funds recorded a combined $38.8 million in net inflows, according to SpotOnChain data. Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH) accounted for most of the inflow, attracting $32.7 million. It was followed by Bitwise’s ETHW, which saw $6.1 million inflow, while other Ethereum ETFs recorded zero flows. While Ethereum ETF inflows were modest compared to Bitcoin, the move marks a cautious return of investor confidence. ETH products have faced sustained outflows in recent weeks due to tightening liquidity and uncertain market signals. Still, the renewed buying interest hints at optimism over Ethereum’s future, especially as the network prepares for key upgrades. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Enterprises Onboard AI Teammates Faster With NVIDIA NeMo Tools to Scale Employee Productivity

An AI agent is only as accurate, relevant and timely as the data that powers it. Now generally available, NVIDIA NeMo microservices are helping enterprise IT quickly build AI teammates that tap into data flywheels to scale employee productivity. The microservices provide an end-to-end developer platform for creating state-of-the-art agentic AI systems and continually optimizing them with data flywheels informed by inference and business data, as well as user preferences. With a data flywheel, enterprise IT can onboard AI agents as digital teammates. These agents can tap into user interactions and data generated during AI inference to continuously improve model performance — turning usage into insight and insight into action. Without a constant stream of high-quality inputs — from databases, user interactions or real-world signals — an agent’s understanding can weaken, making responses less reliable and agents less productive. Maintaining and improving the models that power AI agents in production requires three types of data: inference data to gather insights and adapt to evolving data patterns, up-to-date business data to provide intelligence, and user feedback data to advise if the model and application are performing as expected. NeMo microservices help developers tap into these three data types. NeMo microservices speed AI agent development with end-to-end tools for curating, customizing, evaluating and guardrailing the models that drive their agents. NVIDIA NeMo microservices — including NeMo Customizer, NeMo Evaluator and NeMo Guardrails — can be used alongside NeMo Retriever and NeMo Curator to ease enterprises’ experiences building, optimizing and scaling AI agents through custom enterprise data flywheels. For example: With NeMo microservices, developers can build data flywheels that boost AI agent accuracy and efficiency. Deployed through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, NeMo microservices are easy to operate and can run on any accelerated computing infrastructure, on premises or in the cloud, with enterprise-grade security, stability and support. The microservices have become generally available at a time when enterprises are building large-scale multi-agent systems, where hundreds of specialized agents — with distinct goals and workflows — collaborate to tackle complex tasks as digital teammates, working alongside employees to assist, augment and accelerate work across functions. This enterprise-wide impact positions AI agents as a trillion-dollar opportunity — with applications spanning automated fraud detection, shopping assistants, predictive machine maintenance and document review — and underscores the critical role data flywheels play in transforming business data into actionable insights. NVIDIA partners and industry pioneers are using NeMo microservices to build responsive AI agent platforms so that digital teammates can help get more done. Working with Arize and Quantiphi, AT&T has built an advanced AI-powered agent using NVIDIA NeMo, designed to process a knowledge base of nearly 10,000 documents, refreshed weekly. The scalable, high-performance AI agent is fine-tuned for three key business priorities: speed, cost efficiency and accuracy — all increasingly critical as adoption scales. AT&T boosted AI agent accuracy by up to 40% using NeMo Customizer and Evaluator by fine-tuning a Mistral 7B model to help deliver personalized services, prevent fraud and optimize network performance. BlackRock is working with NeMo microservices for agentic AI capabilities in its Aladdin tech platform, which unifies the investment management process through a common data language. Teaming with Galileo, Cisco’s Outshift team is using NVIDIA NeMo microservices to power a coding assistant that delivers 40% fewer tool selection errors and achieves up to 10x faster response times. Nasdaq is accelerating its Nasdaq Gen AI Platform with NeMo Retriever microservices and NVIDIA NIM microservices. NeMo Retriever enhanced the platform’s search capabilities, leading to up to 30% improved accuracy and response times, in addition to cost savings. NeMo microservices support a broad range of popular open models, including Llama, the Microsoft Phi family of small language models, Google Gemma, Mistral and Llama Nemotron Ultra, currently the top open model on scientific reasoning, coding and complex math benchmarks. Meta has tapped NVIDIA NeMo microservices through new connectors for Meta Llamastack. Users can access the same capabilities — including Customizer, Evaluator and Guardrails — via APIs, enabling them to run the full suite of agent-building workflows within their environment. “With Llamastack integration, agent builders can implement data flywheels powered by NeMo microservices,” said Raghotham Murthy, software engineer, GenAI, at Meta. “This allows them to continuously optimize models to improve accuracy, boost efficiency and reduce total cost of ownership.” Leading AI software providers such as Cloudera, Datadog, Dataiku, DataRobot, DataStax, SuperAnnotate, Weights & Biases and more have integrated NeMo microservices into their platforms. Developers can use NeMo microservices in popular AI frameworks including CrewAI, Haystack by deepset, LangChain, LlamaIndex and Llamastack. Enterprises can build data flywheels with NeMo Retriever microservices using NVIDIA AI Data Platform offerings from NVIDIA-Certified Storage partners including DDN, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, VAST Data and WEKA. Leading enterprise platforms including Amdocs, Cadence, Cohesity, SAP, ServiceNow and Synopsys are using NeMo Retriever microservices in their AI agent solutions. Enterprises can run AI agents on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure, networking and software from leading system providers including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Consulting giants including Accenture, Deloitte and EY are building AI agent platforms for enterprises using NeMo microservices. Developers can download NeMo microservices from the NVIDIA NGC catalog. The microservices can be deployed as part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise with extended-life software branches for API stability, proactive security remediation and enterprise-grade support.

Title: Nvidia announces general availability of NeMo tools for building AI agents

UPDATED 09:00 EDT / APRIL 23 2025 by Kyt Dotson Nvidia Corp. today announced the general availability of NeMo microservices, a set of tools designed to assist developers get artificial intelligence agents up faster by tapping into AI inference and information systems at scale. Agents have become a focal point for creating “digital teammates” capable of driving workforce productivity for knowledge and service workers by taking orders, discovering information and doing proactive work. Unlike AI chatbots, agents can take autonomous actions with little or no human oversight but they need data to make accurate and efficient decisions as part of their reasoning. This can be particularly true for proprietary knowledge, which might be locked behind company firewalls or when using rapidly changing real-time information. “Without a constant stream of high-quality inputs — from databases, user interactions or real-world signals — an agent’s understanding can weaken, making responses less reliable, which makes agents less productive,” said Joey Conway, senior director of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia. To help developers rapidly build and deploy agents, Nvidia is releasing NeMo microservices, including Customizer, Evaluator, Guardrails, Retriever and Curator. They are designed to ease enterprise AI engineers’ experience building agentic AI experiences when scaling and accessing data. Customizer assists with large language model fine-tuning by providing up to 1.8 times higher training throughput. It provides an application programming interface that allows developers to curate models rapidly so they can fit a dataset before they deploy it. Evaluator simplifies the evaluation of AI models and workflows based on custom and industry benchmarks with just five API calls. Guardrails runs atop an AI model or agent to keep it from behaving in a way that is either unsafe or out of bounds. It can provide additional compliance with 1.4x efficiency and only a half-second more latency. Retriever, announced at GTC 2025, allows developers to build agents that can extract data from systems and accurately process it, enabling them to build complex AI data pipelines such as retrieval-augmented generation. “NeMo microservices are easy to operate and can run on any accelerated computing infrastructure, both on-premises and the cloud, while providing enterprise-grade security, stability and support,” added Conway. Nvidia designed the NeMo tools so that developers with general AI knowledge can access them via API calls to get AI agents up and running. Right now enterprises are beginning to build complex multi-agent systems where hundreds of expert agents collaborate to achieve unified goals while working alongside human teammates. NeMo microservices support a large number of popular open AI models, including Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, Microsoft Phi family of small language models, Google LLC’s Gemma and Mistral. Nvidia’s Llama Nemotron Ultra, currently ranking as the top open model on scientific reasoning, coding and complex math benchmarks, is also accessible through the microservices. Numerous leading AI service providers, including Cloudera Inc., Datadog Inc., Dataiku, DataRobot Inc., DataStax Inc., SuperAnnotate AI Inc. and Weights & Biases Inc., have included NeMo microservices in their platforms. Developers can start using these microservices in their processes today through popular AI frameworks such as CrewAI, Haystack by Deepset, LangChain, LlamaIndex and Llamastack. Using the new NeMo microservices, Nvidia partners and tech companies have built AI agent platforms and onboarded digital teammates to get more work done. For example, AT&T Inc. used NeMo Customizer and Evaluator to increase AI agent accuracy by fine-tuning a Mistral 7B model for personalized services, preventing fraud and optimizing network performance. And BlackRock Inc. is working with the microservices in its Aladdin tech platform to unify investment management through a common data language.

By STAN CHOE, AP Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%. Wall Street’s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. The market’s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has “no intention” to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called “a major loser,” because of the Fed’s hesitance to cut interest rates. Trump’s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term. While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump’s tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly. Trump may have recognized the market’s fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,” Wizman said. Markets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down “substantially” from the current 145%. “It won’t be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said. The hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be “very nice” to the world’s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday. If Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted. U.S. businesses say they’re already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global’s latest survey released Wednesday. All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will “more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump’s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration’s officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed. Trump’s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It’s a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump’s actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond market’s reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning. On Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company’s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500. Other stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry’s first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it’s continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers. Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%. Tesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he’ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It’s been struggling because of backlash against Musk’s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government. All told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05. In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1%.

Title: US FTC Sues Uber For Charging Its Customers Without Consent
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-us-ftc-uber-customers-consent/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T12:30:27Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The United States (US) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing application Uber on April 21 for allegedly charging customers for its Uber One subscription service, without their consent. The regulator has also argued that Uber failed to deliver on its promise of discounts and savings as part of Uber One. The ride-hailing app also allegedly made cancellation difficult despite stating that users can cancel the subscription anytime. To cancel Uber One, customers have to go through 12 different actions and go through “a maze of at least seven screens, if they guess the right paths to use, despite there being no mention of cancellation until the fourth screen.” FTC details that Uber auto-renews Uber One subscriptions and removes the cancellation button for the first 48 hours of the billing period. Even if the customer contacts customer service, the company’s representatives take too long to process cancellation requests. This leads to the customer incurring a subscription renewal charge once again. The company enrolled customers into Uber One through a variety of ways, including push notifications, pop-ups in the Uber App and the Uber Eats App, and so on. Through push notifications, it offers people savings on their next ride or food delivery. FTC claims that one such offer the company often presents to its customers is 50% off a one-year membership, and when a customer tries to claim the offer, the company offers the service for free. “Once consumers click the ‘Try for free’ button, they are immediately enrolled in Uber One and will be charged within four weeks, and on a recurring basis thereafter,” the FTC says. It emphasises that in none of these situations does the customer actively provide billing information for this subscription; instead, the company relies on the details it has stored if the customer has ever taken a ride with Uber. The FTC mentions that even before the four-week trial period ends, the company charges customers for the Uber One subscription. Further, if a customer is able to successfully cancel their free trial during the trial period, they immediately lose access to Uber One instead of losing access on the end date of the trial period. When the customer gets to the screen where they can cancel their subscription, Uber requires them to fill out a survey about the reason for cancellation. Till the customer clicks on one of the pre-specified answers to the survey question, it does not allow them to continue to cancel. If the customer clicks an answer and presses continue, a screen appears asking the customer if they want to consider pausing the membership instead. On this page, at the bottom of the page, a button labeled “Pause Uber One” appears prominently in a bright gray textbox, while beneath it is a button labeled “No thanks” in a subdued black textbox with white font. FTC specifies that neither of these buttons mention cancellation. “Further, these buttons are flipped from their placement on the previous screen: On the previous screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is on the top, whereas, on this screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is now on the bottom. This design interface steers the consumer who wishes to cancel away from the action they are trying to take,” the FTC emphasises. Just like the US, in India as well, customers are facing the menace of dealing with allegedly deceptive practices. According to a survey by the consumer community platform LocalCircles, eight out of ten users have encountered dark patterns on ride-hailing services like Ola and Uber. These are deceptive practices that mislead customers into doing things they did not intend to do. Local Circles found that 78% of customers face higher waiting times than what the ride-hailing apps state on their service. “We are glad to learn that the FTC has come down against the use of Dark Patterns by Uber. CCPA [Central Consumer Protection Agency] must take action on similar dark patterns concerns raised by consumers in India against taxi aggregators,” Sachin Taparia, Founder of LocalCircles, told MediaNama. Notably, in December last year, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, took stock of the reports surrounding ride-hailing apps charging people differently based on whether they booked rides through an Android or Apple device. He said that such differential pricing was prima facie an unfair trade practice, and that he has instructed the CCPA to examine price discrepancies in ride-hailing as well as other sectors.

Title: ‘Making the West Great Again’
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/04/making-the-west-great-again.html
Time Published: 2025-04-23T10:00:25Z

Last week Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with Trump at the White House. They reportedly discussed Ukraine, defense spending, economy, space, energy —specifically Italy importing more US liquefied natural gas— and of course the US tariffs looming over EU imports. One item that really stood out, however, was Meloni’s insight into her brand of nationalism. Here she is speaking during the meeting with the press in the Oval Office: “Someone calls me a Western nationalist , I don’t know if that’s the right word, but I know that when I talk about the West, I’m not talking primarily about geographical space , but about civilization.” She added: “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together, and we will keep on working on that.” On its face, it is contradictory. Either one is nationalistic or it subscribes to the western order headquartered in Washington. Yet, Meloni has been at the lead of squaring this circle in Europe over the past few years. As the 2023 elections in Italy approached with Meloni leading the polls, international media was in an uproar over the return of fascism to Rome. It was commonly assumed that she would lead a short-lived government that sparred with the EU and NATO. That belief was reasonably based on Meloni’s past statements critical of the supranational organizations, as well as the worn path from other political insurgencies of both the left and the right. And yet Meloni is still here, now among the five most durable of the Republic: And the party she leads maintains a steadily comfortable cushion in Italian polls. Part of that rests on feckless, Obama-inspired Partitico Democratico and the other is an increasingly disenchanted electorate. But it’s also reflective of Meloni’s realization that real nationalism wouldn’t play in Washington and Brussels and that she was destined to lose any struggle with NATO and the EU. She has instead sought to lead the European flank of “Western nationalism.” Others might call it “civilizational Europe.” To Quinn Slobodian, Meloni would be yet another “bastard of neoliberalism.” While her Brothers of Italy party struggles to crack 30 percent at home, she has become an international darling. Following the New York Times —the US paper of record— announcement at the beginning of 2024 that Meloni “solidifie[d] her credentials” and “put the European establishment at ease” the media has lauded her. She has been bestowed with the coveted title of Europe’s “Trump whisperer.” She was also well-received by the Biden administration and is chummy with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Even the Atlantic Council, the liberal internationalist establishment’s think tank, crowned her with its “Global Citizen” award last year. Meloni’s Western nationalism is the reason she is embraced so enthusiastically. What are the tenets of that philosophy? Let’s take a look. Neoliberalism Meloni and others on the “new right” like Argentine President Javier Milei and Trump himself like to tout themselves as rebels against the grating virtue signalling of the Davos cabal. They might be in style, but in substance they are a continuation. If neoliberalism is markets before people, Meloni and others on the “new” usually say they are for the people, nationalism — in Melon’s case, Western nationalism. Yet they have virtually zero plans to elevate the people over finance and tech—and in many cases seek to further empower the latter. Meloni has made much of her desire for more Italian babies and a strengthening of the family, but her economic policies do the opposite. Indeed, Italian youth continue to emigrate en masse due to the lack of decent paying jobs at home. The Meloni government has been overseeing a wave of privatizations, including critical communications infrastructure to CIA-connected private equity, and plans for more of the state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato, Poste Italiane, Monte dei Paschi bank and energy giant Eni. The firesale is necessitated by more tax cuts for the wealthy, as well as more than billions of euros Rome has burned through in order to address the loss of pipeline gas from Russia, which includes buying more US LNG. In 2023, Meloni chose May Day to announce her government’s promotion of short-term worker contracts, as well as the abolition of Italy’s basic income program, which provided the unemployed with an average of 567 euros a month. Despite the program providing a mild stimulus to the economy, Meloni said its elimination will force people back to work. “Where is the slump in the economy and employment?” she asked. She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have done this: Italy’s real wage misery: inflation-adjusted wages in 2023 were 4.4% lower than in 1990. Even real wages in Greek performed a little better. pic.twitter.com/rRN9QE4JE7 — Philipp Heimberger (@heimbergecon) July 3, 2024 So what of Meloni’s stated desire to “make the West great again”? It appears the tools to accomplish the job are the same that have been used for the three-plus decades. The cure for Italy’s ills is always more wage suppression, more market-friendly reforms, more social spending cuts, and more privatization. The country has actually followed the EU’s neoliberal reform policy rulebook much more closely than Berlin or Paris, and the answer when it inevitably doesn’t work, is always to double down. Meloni has done nothing to change this, and has embraced a future in which Italy is a deindustrialized imperial military outpost that doubles as a sunny Mediterranean corporate resort owned by (mostly) American capital. Immigration that Serves Capital Meloni is anti-immigrant except for those who are valuable for capital. In that case, they are welcome in the garden as a serf. It’s remarkably similar to the Trump-Silicon Valley vision for the US, even down to the use of foreign prisons. Meloni who rode to power two years ago based in part on strong opposition to illegal immigration and asylum. She quickly backed down on her deportations pledge, however, and ended up increasing the supply of cheap foreign labor at the request of Italian capital. She’s made a big show of it all, however, and now has a nearly $1 billion detention facility in Albania sitting empty after courts blocked the plan. They’re now being rebranded as repatriation hubs, in line with a recent EU proposal, which largely embraces Meloni’s vision. What the Albanian detention centers do is offshore the detention of immigrants and refugees outside of EU law while still allowing in those deemed valuable for capital. Meloni, after all, says she wants immigrants that contribute to the economy. ​​Meloni, despite railing against immigrants, is increasing the number of work permits to non-EU nationals in an effort to boost the supply of cheap labor. While Italians try to scrape by on low salaries, foreign workers can be paid even less. According to the 2020 IDOS Statistical Dossier on Immigration, the overall average monthly wage for foreign workers was 1,077 euros in 2019, which was 23.5 percent lower than that of Italians’ 1,408 euros. That gap is only widening in Italy, as well as the EU. In the agricultural sector in particular, migrant workers are subject to various forms of abuse and live and work in inhumane conditions. That is, of course, precisely why Italian oligarchs demanded a certain flow of immigrants. Italian big business welcomed the increase, but immediately said more will be needed to tackle a longstanding demographic decline. So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. Nationalism it ain’t – unless one conceives of the “western nation” as solely a profit extracting mechanism for oligarchs. When Meloni embraces the “Western nationalist” label and explains she’s talking about civilization, that’s the civilization she’s referring to. Atlanticism In Meloni’s speech last year accepting the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen award, one of the items she chose not to talk about was “the efforts the Italian government is doing to reform its country to make it, once again, a protagonist of the geopolitical chessboard.” By that she means American hegemony with Italy—and Europe— acting as the US sidekick. It’s difficult to know what reforms exactly she’s talking about, but we can make some educated guesses. A few hours ahead of Meloni’s meeting with Trump, her finance minister announced Italy would hit 2 percent of GDP on defense spending this year—up from 1.5 percent. There has been speculation that Rome would try some creative accounting by throwing expenditures like the Coast Guard into the defense category, but that looks to have been abandoned in favor of buying more American products. Of course, this will mean more of a budget squeeze, which only reinforces the argument that Italy must privatize state assets. New York-based private equity behemoth KKR, which includes former CIA director David Petraeus as a partner, snatched up the fixed-line network of Telecom Italia last year. Rome approved of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, taking a stake of more than 3 percent in defense and aerospace group Leonardo, which makes it the second largest shareholder after the state. Meloni is getting pushback on the major SpaceX deal she has championed. That potential deal would see Musk’s company provide security and encryption service to the Italian public sector. Meloni has also taken on a decidedly anti-China edge as well, withdrawing from Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative at the end of 2023. Add it all up, and Meloni simply represents different flavor of vassalage than elsewhere in Europe. While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism. We see where that got Germany, although it is a mindset that remains despite the replacement of Scholz and Baerbock with new faces. Italy, too, has also been hammered by the New Cold War and the EU’s severing itself from Russian pipeline gas, which has only added to the economic decay the country has been mired in since joining the common currency in the 1990s. Meloni and her “western nationalism” being welcome in the European halls of power alongside those still clinging to their respectable liberal rules-based order, is likely to only accelerate these trends as the very mixture of Meloni’s style of nationalism and neoliberalism mean that she and the country she currently leads will be sold up the river to further the goals of Western capital. Openly offering Italy up as a “protagonist” piece to be used by the US on the geopolitical chessboard should be setting off alarm bells in Italy. A look at the history of such protagonist American allies would show that Meloni and Italy are soon going to get burned—even if she’s currently the “Trump whisperer.” The Atlantic Council’s “Global Citizen Award”…a bureaucrat who cares only about 1/8th of the globe…one couldnt make this up… Nope. They care only about 1% of the 1/8th of the globe. the Golden Ten Million. I have no statistics but I would guess in Germany agriculture without foreign (mostly undocumented) labour would break down. Same for meat-processing industry. The truly blue-collar work is not even done by natives when they´re poor. And while sociology and left think tanks used to have models on how to organize labour in a democratic society in a meaningful and just way I have the impression the insight and demands to transform those into genuine policies by unions and left parties thereof has been totally abandoned. Thanks for this great piece. I guess I´m gonna pester my Italian friends with it… p.s. We did have discussions over German native Eike Schmidt who had been the director of the Uffizi in Florence until last year. He then planned to run as Florence mayor supported by right-wing parties. (I believe there was even discussion over Schmidt as cultural minister under Meloni.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eike_Schmidt When Meloni won everyone demanded that Schmidt ought to deny any cooperation with her being a “fascist”. I of course doubted that approach. We came to no conclusion. I know too little of the minutes of the preceding 10 years in Italian politics to be able to judge if there were major differences between Meloni and here social democratic predecessors to “justify” such a move to oppose as cultural manager beyond self-serving. When does activism serve the people, when does it not? Schmidt lost. His opponent, Sara Funaro had a Jewish father. So, of course, The Times of Israel gets involved. But she also has not placed Judaism or Israel at the center of her career, instead trying to respond to hate against her with a poker face and framing her public persona around her family’s deep roots in the Tuscan city.> Sounds like she’s dealing with antisemitism, instead of responding to her German opponent, with no “deep roots” in Florence. On Israel “Florence has always been a city of peace and dialogue and does not tolerate divisive messages that incite hatred,” she said at the time. “Always”? Dante might have had a different opinion. For the future “Serving as the mayor of Florence opens up many opportunities,” said Pini. “All Florence mayors went on doing something at the national or international level. Renzi? Thank you, Conor. Just a bit off topic from Blighty: Last December, to commemorate Labour’s first six months in power (or should that be in office, but not in power), the Financial Times, including a friend on the City team, interviewed some of the back room staff and included some settling of scores. Not all of the material was published as the FT would like to keep lines of communication open. Two things struck, alarmed even, my friend as they are married to the child of immigrants and would like to start a family. Mandelson’s protege and the brains behind Starmer, Cork born and raised and Fine Gael stalwart Morgan McSweeney, said Labour would not be outflanked from the right and looked forward to and even relished fighting (Farage’s) Reform on their turf, Labour thinks the latter part of this decade and next will be dominated by Vance, Weidel (that was before the German federal elections), Le Pen (that was before the court case) and Meloni, so Starmer wants and needs to be on (their) side, Labour thinks the left and even centre have nowhere to go, and (the bit which alarmed my friend) would scapegoat immigrants and other minorities. I think Italy may get burned, but Meloni won’t be. For example, former Finnish PM Sanne Marin is employed by Blair and lives in style in London. The likes of Baerbock, Kallas, von der Leyen (descendant of English gentry) and Sandu can look forward to that retirement from front line politics. The sons of Radek Sikorski and Anne Apfelbaum went to Eton and Oxford and divide their time between London, the Cotswolds and NYC. This is the lifestyle that the US elite can offer them, so why not betray one’s country. “… While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism.” Yes. This is the key point everywhere in the West as far as I can tell. These increasingly “polarized” political camps are mainly sheep-herding mechanisms for different segments of the “electorate,” while the trajectories of both foreign and domestic policy continue on steadily through the administrations of “Democrats” or “Republicans,” “Socialists” or “Conservatives,” the “Left” or the “Right,” etc. As Conor emphasizes here and has noted before, there is a “compatible right” just as there is a “compatible left” in the West. The political rhetoric differs; the policies remain the same. Wowsers. That graphic. Berlusconi, Craxi, Renzi, Meloni. Every one of them successful postmodern politicians — purveyors of the big nothing. One might argue, though, that Meloni is the most intelligent and the least corrupt. Berlusconi represented (and his Forza Italia still represents) the big bourgeoisie of Lombardy and the Veneto. Craxi is the politician who makes Italians shake their heads: “Bettino should have known better.” Renzi is the Hillary Clinton of Italy, although slightly more charming: He’s office politics, self-promotion, and grift, grift, grift. The most important part of this excellent article is that Italian politics isn’t all that hard to understand. The Anglosphere likes to go on about an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a mozzarella, but there is no mystery of how Italian politics works, how the parties align, and how Italian politicians have damaged the social state to comply with directives from the EU. To wit: “She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have … [declined over the course of the past thirty years].” Frankly, I am appalled by how little Italians make. Further, because minimum wage is decided by negotiations by economic sector and not by a national law, the concept of a minimum wage is rickety. Fortunately, workplace protections are still stronger in Italy than in “at-will employee” U S of A. I will be watching the results of the referendums to be held on 8 / 9 June to repeal the so-called Jobs Act and to change citizenship requirements to be less reliant on jus sanguinis (inherited citizenship). Further, the argument that the Western industrial countries aren’t competitive on wages doesn’t hold up when one looks at how low Italian wages are. Instead, it’s the war on the working class. Heck, even Italian medical doctors don’t make what a U.S. medical doctor makes. As to “Western nationalism,” which must come out of the Frodo-Atreju-Gollum-Tolkien wing of the Fratelli d’Italia, I am reminded of Meloni’s insistence on the use of the word Nazione for Italy. Italy is many things, but it is too varied a country to be a nazione. For most Italians, it is Il Paese. The country. Nation is a top-down idea, a fantasy of hierarchy. Here in the Undisclosed Region, mon petit pays, society is from the ground up — a country of cows, bees, chocolate, educution, an amazing work ethic, and religion in the style of Pope Francis. Nation, indeed. Thank you, DJG. I have noticed the Italians moving to Mauritius. They tend to work in textiles, hotels and catering, but some are in finance and technology. There are a dozen families, split evenly between young and retirees, in my small town on the west coast. We have had Italian neighbours, two different families, for a dozen years. With regard to Renzi, he’s the darling of British centrists. They know nothing about him apart from the marketing by the MSM. From your comments, it seems that many people from Europe are moving to Mauritius. Any push-back from the local population against that form of immigration? And how much total population can Mauritius comfortably host? Thank you. There’s very little evidence of push back other than for environmental reasons, insufficient water / water infrastructure and loss of farm land, and, but not solely due to much better paid foreigners, house prices going up. Many, if not most, Mauritians have family and friends abroad, so they are relaxed. Also, there are no indigenous Mauritians. Migrants are quite safe and most welcome there. There aren’t enough Mauritians, especially with skills. DJG, What are your thoughts about the impact on Italy of Hillary Clinton? She is linked to the downfall of Muammar Khadaffi. His efforts held back the wave of immigration through Lampedusa. I wouldn’t worry too much about the announcements of Meloni. She is kinda like the AOC of the EU. She too was elected on the basis of being a reformer and once in she ran up the Jolly Roger and showed her true colours. That threat that Ursula made against her before her election about the EU having the tools to use to bring her in line was totally unnecessary. With Biden in she trimmed Italy’s sails to what he wanted as much as she could and even rescued him when he stared to wander away from that group of EU leaders. But then the winds of change came along with the election of Donald Trump and she jumped a plane to meet with him for several hours in Mar-a-Lago back in January. And that is the key with her. She will always align herself with the most powerful figure at any particular time in order to ensure her own political survival. If Putin was made head of the EU tomorrow I’m sure that she would jump the next plane to Moscow to talk to him about Italy’s historical ties to Russia. Thank you, Rev. Having worked in Russia for HSBC twenty years ago, I noticed how much of the equipment for factories and parts for vehicles came from Italy. Italy was then and is to some extent now a serious competitor for Germany, but China is eclipsing the pair. The problem for the Western mindset in general, is that it is very node oriented, from atoms to individuals, in a reality that is the interplay between nodes and networks. The essence of the node is synchronization, everything on the same wavelength, functioning as one. While the essence of the network is harmonization. Everything interacting, with an overall balance. “Entangled particles.” So when it’s just the node, it becomes a feedback loop with no circuit breakers. Microphone up to the speaker, shriek going parabolic. Echo chamber. Like Israel. The eventual consequence is when it all goes super nova and collapses into the vortex in the middle. Black hole. If they ditched the euphemisms and just explained what they believe about the way the world works, they’d sound more coherent. Imagine Meloni pledging her allegiance to the Empire, waxing rhapsodic about her imperial patriotism, and exclaiming how true and just it is that the lesser orders don’t get a say in how it’s run. It might take less energy than the constant stream of P.R. talk, which I know politicians enjoy, somewhat sadistically. Is it just me or is this basically another slight variant of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” with somewhat different costuming? And wasn’t even that basically a way to make xenophobia intellectually respectable again? So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. This is what happened in the great Roman Empire. Brave Roman citizens left Rome to expand abroad, and vice versa, the conquered people went to Rome, the economic center of the city. I think Meloni is more of a traditionalist than Mussolini. The chart by Philipp Heimberger is a devastating indictment of Italy’s economic (mis-)management over the past 30 years. Even worse than Greece. 1987’s Il Sorpasso is just a distant memory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_sorpasso_(economics) Thank you and well said. I have followed Heimberger’s work for years. Some years ago, he was invited to meetings in Rome and Brussels to discuss his analysis. Unfortunately, the neoliberal Italian government, which set up the meetings, did not support his findings. Young Italians are still coming to the UK. One hears from them of their peers in Germany and Netherlands. It’s so sad that Italy,which once had a strong communist/leftist movement, now only has these pathetic centrist parties. This, no one to challenge Meloni. I thought 5 states movement might make an impact, but did not happen. They gave up their sovereignty when they joined the euro. Your email address will not be published.

Full Content:
The new shape of climate-conscious investing. Can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? That’s the question we started this series with, and in this episode, we try to answer that question. So far, we’ve been talking about the trillions of dollars of investor capital that could fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about our own money? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? One place where you might have more power than you think is in your retirement savings. By taking a closer look at how you invest that money, you could potentially reduce your carbon impact more than going vegan, putting solar on your roof or buying an electric car. And while environmental, social and governance investing might be dead — or deeply wounded — some governments aren’t backing off climate-conscious investing. New York City has developed an aggressive investing strategy to accelerate its energy transition; it’s invested billions of dollars in climate solutions, and it’s divesting from some fossil fuel companies. In this episode, we look at the future of climate-conscious investing. Host Amy Scott pops the hood of her own retirement investments and shows you how you can too. We also visit a battery storage farm in the Bronx to see how New York City is leveraging its shareholder power to fund climate solutions. Finally, we look at a phenomenon that has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash — something called “greenhushing.” Note: Marketplace podcasts are meant to be heard, with emphasis, tone and audio elements a transcript can’t capture. Transcripts are generated using a combination of automated software and human transcribers, and may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting it. Amy Scott: If I'm an investor, you know, worried about the climate crisis, what kind of impact do my retirement savings have? Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out that moving your investments to a climate friendly investment option is the single most impactful thing that the average American can do for climate change. Amy Scott: We've been talking so far this season about other people's money, the trillions of dollars of investor capital that can fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about you and me? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? To find out, I called up Alex Wright-Gladstein. She's the founder and CEO of Sphere, a company focused on climate friendly investing, and Alex says there's a lot of invisible power in our retirement portfolios. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out it's more impactful than the combination of going vegan, never flying again, driving an electric car, putting solar on your house. Amy Scott: Sphere has a tool online where you can look up the carbon impact of your workplace retirement plan. I type in Marketplace's parent company. Ooh, $19 million. This is how much American Public Media Group employees have invested in fossil fuel companies through their retirement savings plan. And scroll through the report, which is based on tax filings from 2021. On average, about $15,700 per employee, and then it compares us to some other companies. So Walmart is similar. Apple is actually lower, 8.1%, but of course, as that's a percentage, the actual money would be significantly more. If my employer divested from fossil fuels, the website tells me, it would be like taking 7800 cars off the road each year. Anyone listening in HR? So that's my workplace as a whole. For a more granular look, Alex points me to another website called fossilfreefunds.org, where I can enter the ticker symbols for the individual funds I'm invested in. All right, so... And that's when things get a bit grimmer. Fidelity international index. I'm going to look up that. Ooh, it gets an F. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Yeah. Amy Scott: Oh shoot. Fossil fuel exposure of 10.33% places the fund in the F tier. Oof, okay. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's invested in companies including Shell and Total and BP, etc. Amy Scott: Alex tries to reassure me. Alex Wright-Gladstein: I will say that's pretty standard for any international index fund. Amy Scott: Okay… I poke around a bit more, try out a few more index funds that I have. It doesn't get much better. A D is as good as it gets. Ouch. Alex says, lately, more people are looking for greener alternatives. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Especially since the most recent election, I think people realized they can't rely on the government to save us when it comes to climate change, and so they've been turning to what they can do. Amy Scott: That raises a really important question, which is kind of the question that is overarching our series, can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? Alex Wright-Gladstein: I believe the answer is yes. I really do believe that this is the most impactful thing that we can do to turn around climate change, and we absolutely can invest our way out of the crisis. Amy Scott: I'm Amy Scott. This is How We Survive. Last episode, we looked back at the origins of the ESG backlash. In this episode, we look forward to the future of climate-conscious investing, how we as individuals can make a difference with our own retirement savings, and how the country's largest city is using its shareholder power to accelerate the energy transition. While that acronym ESG might be dead or deeply wounded, the principles behind it live on. This is episode three, reincarnation. Before she started Sphere, Alex Wright-Gladstein was running a clean tech company and wanted to offer her employees a climate-friendly option in their retirement plan. But she had a hard time finding any. Alex Wright-Gladstein: And when I finally got offered some options by our 401K advisors, they were offering ESG options. And I had never heard the term ESG before. I didn't know what it meant, but I looked up the funds, and I saw that they were invested in fossil fuel companies. And I was like, Okay, I don't know what ESG means, but I don't think it means climate friendly. Amy Scott: Remember, the climate part of ESG is concerned with climate risk, how companies are preparing for the risks the climate crisis might pose, not necessarily how good they are for the environment. So Alex decided to create her own index fund, the Sphere 500 Climate Fund. Alex Wright-Gladstein: The key thing we do is exclude fossil fuel companies. Amy Scott: The Sphere 500 is made up of the top 500 companies in the US by market value, minus fossil fuel companies. It also excludes some other businesses, like tobacco, private prisons, and weapons manufacturers. Alex says Sphere also votes its shares in favor of climate friendly proposals, which she says is rare for traditional fund managers. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Most people don't think about this, but we're having our shares voted on our behalf by fund managers who are voting against climate related shareholder proposals 98% of the time. Amy Scott: Alex says none of this means investors lose out on returns. The Sphere 500 has low fees, similar to any S&P 500 index fund, and it performs about as well. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's really brilliant how really it's the fossil fuel industry and the fossil fuel lobby has framed this as, Well, you gotta choose between investing with your progressive values or investing for good returns, when data actually shows that you don't have to choose. You can do both. Amy Scott: Today, Sphere's fund is available in more than 200 401K plans, but not to public retirees in Texas. Remember the blacklist we talked about last episode? Sphere's fund is on that list, meaning Texas pension funds can't invest in it. Alex says Sphere protested the decision. Alex Wright-Gladstein: We said, Yes, we care about climate change, but look, here are all the financial reasons that we're excluding fossil fuels. We showed how they've been the worst performers of the economy over the past 10, 15, 20 years. We showed how volatile the industry is, and how if you want to avoid that volatility, it can make sense to exclude them. Amy Scott: But it stayed on the blacklist. Now the company is part of a lawsuit challenging the state's anti-ESG law on constitutional grounds. But while Texas and a growing number of states have sought to outlaw climate-conscious investing, other governments are taking the opposite approach, like New York City. How did someone manage to get graffiti on that building? That's amazing. Brad Lander: That is impressive. Amy Scott: From a high rise in Manhattan's financial district, I'm taking in the view of the New York Harbor with Brad Lander, controller of New York City. Brad Lander: We are in Seven World Trade Center overlooking Brooklyn and Queens and Long Island and lower Manhattan. It's a gorgeous view this morning. Amy Scott: As the city's chief financial officer, he monitors the health of its finances and its public pension funds, money belonging to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living in the boroughs surrounding us. Brad Lander: You can see what a harbor city it is. You know, it's hard not to come up here and think about what Superstorm Sandy did and how long we have to go to be ready. Amy Scott: In 2012, New York City was caught by surprise when Superstorm Sandy walloped the East Coast. It caused massive flooding in the city and an estimated $19 billion in damage. 52 people died. Brad Lander: Everyone was impacted. Of course, people in communities that were were flooded and displaced were most directly impacted. The subways were out for a few days, and the power was out and you couldn't get gasoline into the gas terminal so you couldn't buy gas in the gas stations. Amy Scott: It was a long road to recovery, and Controller Lander says it was a wake up call. Brad Lander: So it really did spark something in the city. Amy Scott: So in the aftermath of the storm, New York decided to take action. The state and the city are now working on slashing emissions and making buildings more efficient, and taking a hard look at their investments. Brad Lander: If we don't collectively achieve decarbonization goals, it's not only going to cost lives like it did in Superstorm Sandy, it's going to cost trillions of dollars, and we'll feel the impact of that in our funds. Amy Scott: There's the physical risk to investments from extreme weather and sea level rise, but also, so called transition risk, from the shift to a low carbon economy. You don't want a portfolio full of fossil fuel stocks when everyone's driving an EV. Brad Lander: So we've adopted one of the most ambitious Net Zero implementation plans, one of the boldest climate transition investing strategies of any US public pension fund. Amy Scott: That strategy involves divesting from some fossil fuel companies and engaging other companies, like utilities, to pressure them to reduce emissions. Not everyone is happy with that approach. A few years ago, some employees filed a lawsuit accusing the city's pension plans of a breach of fiduciary duty for divesting from fossil fuels. Brad Lander: But the judge dismissed the case because their pensions are being paid, our returns are good, and the judge concluded that they lack standing. Amy Scott: In fact, he says last year, returns were 10%, beating most of the system's public sector peers. The city is also investing its pension funds in climate solutions. Brad Lander: We increased our clean energy and climate transition investments now to over $11 billion in some amazing companies. Amy Scott: One of those companies is Nine Dot Energy. Yeah, we made it. Adam Cohen: Our little corner of the northeast Bronx. Amy Scott: Pretty cool. I've never been up here. In a fenced in gravel lot sandwiched between an elementary school and a big shopping center, I meet up with co-founder, Adam Cohen. All right, you want to show us around? Adam Cohen: Sure. Amy Scott: With his navy hoodie, he looks the part of a young entrepreneur. Adam Cohen: We can walk this way. Amy Scott: We walk down a row of big gray cabinets. Adam Cohen: So these are batteries. These are big batteries. Amy Scott: Can you unlock one of those cages for us or no? Adam Cohen: No. Amy Scott: What would happen? Voice 1: A really painful death. No, I'm just kidding. Adam Cohen: No, nothing. Nothing would happen. Amy Scott: These cabinets hold a combined three megawatts of battery storage. Nine Dot estimates that's enough to power about 3000 New York City households for four hours on a hot summer day. The batteries sit here all charged up with energy from the power lines overhead. Adam Cohen: And then hold that power until the utility says, Please give it back. Amy Scott: When the grid for the city gets stressed, maybe it's an especially hot summer day and everyone's running their AC, the city utility, Con Ed, can call on Nine Dot to help relieve that stress. Adam Cohen: So last summer, it was called half a dozen times, so in the peak of the peak days. Amy Scott: Enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a combined 24 metric tons. That's the equivalent of 9000 car trips on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Nine Dot's hope is that more of these battery storage farms can be built all over the city, reducing the reliance on dirty power plants and eventually helping the grid transition to renewable sources. Adam Cohen: The sun only shines when nature tells it to, the wind only blows when nature tells it to, but people use electricity when they decide to, and so a battery helps mediate that process. It pulls in the extra power when it's available and then we put it back out when people call for it. Amy Scott: Nine Dot is still in growth mode, but Brad Lander and the city of New York hope the investment pays off, not just for retirees, but for future generations, like the kids at the school right across the street from the battery farm. Virtue Onoja: I'm definitely an artist. One thing about me, I'm definitely an artist. Amy Scott: Virtue Onoja is a sixth grader who attended the Bronx Charter School for Better Learning II. Two years ago, Nine Dot invited students to paint a mural along the outside of the fence with a local artist. Virtue Onoja: Down over here, I did like most stuff over here. I drew like most of the park and the trees. Amy Scott: Walking me up and down the fence, Virtue points out some of her drawings. Virtue Onoja: I drew a clear blue sky, no pollution, no nothing. Beautiful flowers, beautiful yellow flowers and the sun. Amy Scott: There are also drawings of windmills and electric school buses. It's a hopeful imagining of the future that the city is trying to invest into reality. But while New York is loudly and proudly pushing ahead, another phenomenon has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: Coming up after the break. [BREAK] Amy Scott: Just a few weeks ago reading the news, I noticed Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, was out with his latest open letter. It's a wide ranging essay touching on the democratization of investing, infrastructure and the retirement savings crisis. In 27 pages, no mentions of ESG, no surprise, or climate change. There was one mention of decarbonization in reference to China. Instead, he argued for energy pragmatism. That's something he talked about recently as keynote speaker at one of the largest oil and gas conferences in the world. Larry Fink: I think across the board, we have to think about power and energy in a pragmatic way. When the whole conversation, including some of my CEO letters, back a few years back when we talked about that we're going to have to focus on decarbonization. I still believe that, but I also caution that any decarbonizing technology right now is highly inflationary. Amy Scott: As in, too expensive. Larry Fink: We have to be working side by side in trying to find ways of reducing the costs of wind and solar and other energy sources. But let's be clear, we're going to be dependent on dispatchable power for a long, long time. Amy Scott: Dispatchable power meaning sources that can be turned on or off and still rely heavily on fossil fuels. Gone is the urgency from Fink's previous letters. And to be fair, the global situation has changed. Russia's invasion of Ukraine increased demand for US natural gas. The explosion of AI requires more and more energy, and the United States has elected a pro-fossil fuel president who is hostile to the energy transition and actively trying to stop it. All of these factors, along with the ESG backlash, have led investors to push climate risk off the main stage and into the wings. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: This is Bruce Usher at the Columbia Business School. We heard from him in the first episode about the origins of ESG. You've heard of greenwashing, where companies make misleading claims about how eco-friendly they are. Bruce says, with green hushing... Bruce Usher: Businesses are not talking about what they're doing on climate change for political reasons, or they just feel there's not that, you know, it's not advantageous for them to talk about it. But in fact, the business activity may not change that much. If renewable energy is profitable, people will keep doing renewable energy. If, if selling electric vehicles is successful, they'll keep selling electric vehicles. Amy Scott: So while BlackRock may not talk so much about ESG, Bruce says phrases like transition finance have taken its place. Bruce Usher: Transition finance is financing the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. It's very similar investing. The point is that companies are going to change what they say, based on the political temperature, but at the end of the day, if there's a profitable business in these industries, they will continue to invest in them. Amy Scott: I asked Jason Isaac about this. Remember from last episode, he was the architect of the original anti-ESG law in Texas. Amy Scott: So have you heard the term green hushing? Jason Isaac: I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Jason agrees, even after the Texas law passed, he's not convinced financial firms have changed their ways. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. They're virtue signaling to Republican or red states that, oh, we're getting out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. We're getting out of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. But in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. We're going to continue to work towards net zero and decarbonization in alignment with the Paris Accords. Amy Scott: Meanwhile, ESG is still popular in Europe and Canada and other parts of the world, but there's no question Jason's and others' efforts have had a chilling effect. In the past two years, investors have pulled more money out of US ESG funds than they've put in, according to Morningstar. So many firms have withdrawn from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative it suspended activities. And Brad Lander, New York City controller, says that matters. Brad Lander: It is deeply disappointing the ways that asset managers in general including BlackRock and large financial institutions have walked back from what they know is wise fiduciary investing. This is an urgent crisis. If we had 100 years for the energy transition that we have to make, it might be a different story. But no, if you know climate risk is financial risk, and you believe it's your fiduciary duty to invest in ways that are attentive to risk, you've got to have the courage to stand up and say so. Amy Scott: We started this season with a question, was I naive to think Wall Street might actually save us from the climate crisis? And the answer is, yeah, a little bit. But the reality is also more complicated than I realized. These are crucial years to be slow pedaling climate action, the damage is very real. But as inaction becomes more and more costly, investors seeking profits and ways to manage their risks from climate change, will continue to fund solutions, whatever their motivations. Like it or not, nothing motivates people like money. Thanks for listening.

Title: Rural Trump Voters Won’t Regret Their Vote Until Democrats Fight for Them

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Trump promised to address the opioid epidemic and restore small towns to health and prosperity. The president has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. The damage done just in the Trump administration’s first three months could fill the National Archives—assuming that department still exists. Many of those moves, including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran gulag, have been cruel and utterly unjust. Yet public support for Trump, though declining, remains stubbornly high among rural and working-class people. Some part of that support comes from his ability to couch everything he does as retaliation against liberal elites and a blow against the “rigged system” those elites helped create—a system that has undermined the values and livelihoods of ordinary working people. What will it take to stop Trump? It’s hard to predict how many of the people who supported Trump will turn against him because of the deportation of Garcia, student activists, and others. Those fights absolutely must continue and, we hope, will awaken more and more Americans to the dismantling of democracy. But there will always be those who are moved more by negative impacts to their daily lives. Job loss, hospital and school closures, a huge spike in the cost of essential goods—these are perennial deal-breakers that outlive the daily news cycle. As we suggested in our February column, reacting negatively to every radical idea Trump tosses out only solidifies the left’s position as defenders of the establishment—the very system tens of millions of Americans blame for their woes. We also believe that protesting the bad stuff only gets us so far, and that a positive vision for bettering the lives of rural and working people must be front and center. That said, when it does come to complaining loudly about the impact of Trump’s chaotic nihilism, we should focus on actions that have hurt large numbers of people, many of whom voted for Trump. We need to empathize with and acknowledge their struggles and help channel it into buyers’ remorse: “Trump has betrayed us” gets to the heart of the matter, whereas “Hands off!” smacks of a desire to restore the status quo. To stop Trump and reverse the assault on our economy and democracy, we need to redeploy some of our outrage to highlight how Trump’s actions are actually making the rigged system worse for the folks who put him in office: farmers, small businesses, coal miners, factory and blue-collar workers, consumers struggling with high prices and debt. Until our protest routinely includes the betrayal of folks like these, we have almost no chance of building the broad resistance coalition needed to reverse the disastrous course we’re on. With that in mind, we offer a few examples of Trump’s betrayals of rural and working-class people that we urge the left to prioritize, while also highlighting policies that will reverse those betrayals. Farmers, a core constituency for Trump, have been among the worst hit by his actions since taking office. For midsize and larger farmers, tariffs have prompted widespread anxiety that they are being squeezed from both ends: They’re facing higher costs on inputs like Canadian potash and steel for agricultural equipment, combined with a potentially dramatic loss of markets for soybeans, pork, and other commodities. On top of that, the dismantling of USAID amounts to nearly $2 billion in lost sales for US farmers. For smaller farmers, the termination of the Farm to School program and the Local Food Purchase Program for food banks have eliminated more than $1 billion in markets for fresh produce, while undermining the effort to provide healthy food to kids and people in need. And for farmers of all sizes, the suspension of contractual payments to farmers who’ve undertaken conservation, soil building, renewable energy, and other improvements to their farms is devastating. At least 30,000 of these farmers, who each expended tens of thousands of dollars based on USDA commitments, now find themselves in debt, unclear whether the promised reimbursements will ever materialize. But farmers aren’t the only rural folks getting screwed. Workers and small-business owners are increasingly worried about their livelihoods. Even before the latest round of tariffs, small-business confidence had declined for all three months of Trump’s presidency, with just one in five small business owners saying they expect sales and business conditions to improve in the near future. That uncertainty translates to less investment and hiring on the part of existing small businesses, and fewer new business start-ups. For workers in bigger companies, the surge in union organizing seen under the Biden administration is running into a wall of anti-worker actions from Trump. These include the firing of pro-worker members of the NLRB such as Jennifer Abruzzo, replaced by Crystal Carey, a lawyer whose firm represents notoriously anti-union Tesla and Amazon. Trump has also eliminated the $17 hourly minimum-wage requirement for federal contractors while working to completely dismantle unions representing federal workers. Sophie Lewis Elie Mystal Elie Mystal Jeet Heer Veterans, who are more likely to live in rural areas, will be hurt especially hard by the double kneecapping of Medicaid and Veterans Affairs (VA). The New York Times reports that, in addition to layoffs, the VA has been rocked by DOGE’s abrupt return-to-work policy. VA psychiatrists who have, for decades, counseled veterans remotely, now suddenly have to conduct their sessions in open cubicles that lack privacy. Many of them are quitting in protest. Fourteen million (nearly one in five) rural adults rely on Medicaid, a program Republicans aim to cut by $880 billion (roughly 20 percent of the program) over the next decade. Already struggling rural hospitals and clinics rely on Medicaid funds to stay afloat. Over the past 10 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, leaving their patients stranded a hundred or more miles from the nearest emergency room. Most of the rural hospitals that do remain open have eliminated their maternity wards. Slashing Medicaid spending will trigger further hospital closures and strain already paltry substance abuse, mental health, and Indian health services. And then there are the millions of consumers just struggling to make ends meet. They’ve been hit not only by continued rising prices—the inflation rate has been between 2.4 and 3 percent since Trump took office—but by the elimination of protections from junk fees from banks and credit card companies. Joined by the Republican-controlled Senate, the Trump administration is eliminating the $8 late-fee cap instituted toward the end of Biden’s term, allowing companies to once again charge exorbitant fees to people who don’t pay on time. The lower average incomes of rural and working-class people make high prices and junk banking fees all the more difficult to manage. Donald Trump carried rural America by a 40-point margin. He promised forgotten Americans he would unrig the system, address the opioid epidemic, and restore small towns to health and prosperity. Even more than most of his predecessors, Trump has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. Reversing the tidal wave of destruction he has unleashed requires that we on the left do something we should have done a long time ago: open our doors wide to the farmers, miners, truckers, house cleaners, automakers, and working folks—white, brown, and Black—who picked him over us. We don’t just need them to regain Congress in 2026. We need them to save our country. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Elon Musk made big promises for Tesla, but 2 products are key to a rebound
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-analysts-react-earnings-robotaxis-affordable-cars-plan-timing-profit-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-23T09:18:54Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk made some big, exciting promises to Tesla investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday — but he said they won't start paying off until mid-2026 or later. In the hours after Tesla reported, analysts said they were waiting for two things: a highly anticipated cheaper car and for Tesla's robotaxi to hit the market. Tesla's robotaxi, which was unveiled in October, is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be hailed on a ride-sharing app like a cab. Tesla has also been teasing a cheaper car — without disclosing its model or features — since 2020. Tesla missed expectations for the first quarter, reporting a 71% drop in profits and a 9% drop in revenue. Vehicle sales in particular suffered, with auto revenues down 20% year over year and vehicle deliveries down 13%. The EV maker has faced protests, boycotts, and attacks in recent months over Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Musk announced on the earnings call that he'd be stepping back from DOGE in May, good news to investors who had been concerned that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention. Tesla stock jumped about 7% after hours, but it is down 41% this year. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Andres Sheppard highlighted the robotaxi and cheaper model in a note following earnings. They added that regulatory approval for full self-driving and robotaxi remains a key risk for Tesla's stock price. A more affordable model could open up Tesla's potential customer base and help the company compete internationally against low-cost Chinese EVs. Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said, "Tesla has room for significant improvement." "If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly-awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year," he said in a note following the earnings call. Yun Mei, an EV analyst at China Great Wall Securities, emphasized the robotaxi business in an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She said that she has "strong faith" in Tesla's ability to launch robotaxis because Musk's ownership of xAI gives Tesla a "first mover advantage" in the physical AI space. But she estimated that robotaxis would take around three years to pay off. Tesla has declined offers to pair up with existing ride-hailing platforms like Uber to market its Cybercab business, which could delay its robotaxis becoming mainstream. In a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled in October, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft. Tesla's biggest cheerleader said that these product launches require Musk's focus, which has recently been on DOGE. "This quarter was a disaster," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday appearance on CNBC after Tesla's earnings. "Everything that's going on here in terms of the opportunities around autonomous, lower cost vehicles, Cybercab, everything else — Musk needs to drive that," he added. Ives was more positive about Musk's decision to spend less time on DOGE. In a research note published after Tesla's analysts call, he hailed the move as a "turning point" for the company. "Musk recommitting as CEO at Tesla and basically leaving his DOGE role over the next month is the biggest and best possible news Tesla investors could have heard last night," Ives wrote, adding that Tesla had got its "biggest asset" back ahead of the crucial robotaxi and affordable EV launches. Musk also set some lofty goals for Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Tesla is trying to diversify as EV sales have struggled. Slowing EV sales were an issue for Tesla even before Musk's work with DOGE, in part because of increased competition and consumers opting for hybrids over fully electric vehicles. Musk said he expects Tesla to have millions of fully autonomous Teslas on America's streets by the second half of next year. Musk added that Tesla would "start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year" or the second half of next year. The company has often missed target dates in the past, and Musk has previously acknowledged being overly optimistic about timelines. Musk also said Tesla was making good progress on Optimus, its humanoid robot, and it expected to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. He said the company could be producing one million robots a year by 2029 or 2030. Jump to

Key Points Institutional Adoption Bitcoin’s price has been boosted by increased institutional interest, especially through the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These ETFs, like BlackRock’s, have made it easier for investors to buy Bitcoin, with assets under management expected to reach over $250 billion by 2025 (Forbes). This has broadened its appeal to mainstream and institutional investors, driving up demand. Regulatory and Political Influence The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has created a pro-crypto environment. Trump’s policies, including plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler with a more crypto-friendly appointee, have boosted investor confidence (CNBC). Regulatory optimism globally, with clearer frameworks expected in 2025, has also supported the price surge. Macroeconomic Factors Lower interest rates, with major central banks expected to cut rates in 2025, have made Bitcoin more attractive as a risk-on asset. The Federal Reserve’s dovish signals, including potential rate cuts, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin, enhancing its appeal as an inflation hedge (Euronews). Supply and Demand Dynamics The April 2024 halving reduced Bitcoin’s supply by lowering miner rewards, historically leading to price increases due to scarcity. Combined with sustained demand, especially from institutions, this has contributed to the current high price (Swan Bitcoin). Comprehensive Analysis of Bitcoin’s Price Surge as of April 23, 2025 This analysis provides a detailed examination of the factors contributing to Bitcoin’s recent price surge, offering insights for investors, analysts, and enthusiasts. The information is synthesized from recent articles and market analyses, ensuring a thorough understanding of the current market dynamics as of 12:50 PM +07 on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. Background and Context Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable rally, reaching a new all-time high of over $93,000 in recent months, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This surge aligns with historical patterns, particularly the four-year market cycle, and is influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic, regulatory, and technical factors. The following sections detail these drivers, supported by data and expert insights. Key Drivers of the Price Surge Institutional Adoption and Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant catalysts for Bitcoin’s price increase is the surge in institutional adoption, particularly through the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in 2024. These ETFs, which began trading in January 2024, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors, with expected assets under management (AUM) projected to cross $250 billion by 2025, as noted by CNBC. The increased demand from ETFs, coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, has improved liquidity and potentially contributed to overvaluation, as discussed in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This institutional participation is evident in the rising BTC supply among long-term holders, with waning spending pressure, as highlighted by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Regulatory Developments and Political Influence Regulatory clarity and favorable policies have significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price. The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024, with his pro-crypto platform, has been a major driver. Trump vowed to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stepped down in January 2025, and indicated plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve using seized funds, as reported by CNBC. This shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment is expected to boost institutional flows, with experts anticipating increased adoption by corporations and nation-states, including five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, according to [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic trends, particularly the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, have played a crucial role. Earlier in 2025, the Fed signaled dovish policies, expecting to cut interest rates twice, and kept the benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging tariff-driven inflation as “transitory,” as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, making it an attractive inflation hedge. This is supported by Bitcoin’s 83% correlation with global liquidity, as noted in [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]), amid rising U.S. debt and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin Halving and Supply Dynamics The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which reduced miner rewards, has historically been a bullish trigger for prices. This event, occurring every four years, reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, increasing scarcity and supporting price appreciation. Historical data shows post-halving price increases, such as reaching $1,100 in November 2013 and $64,000 in April 2021, as discussed in Swan Bitcoin. The 2024 halving, combined with sustained demand, has contributed to the current bull run, as noted by [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Market Sentiment and Historical Cycles The crypto market is currently in a growth phase, potentially peaking between 2024 and 2025, aligning with the historical four-year market cycle, as per [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Positive news, such as regulatory acceptance and technological advancements, has created a bullish sentiment, while social media and online forums have influenced retail investor decisions, as discussed in [OSL]([invalid url, do not cite]). Fear of missing out (FOMO) has led to sudden buying surges, further driving prices, while fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can trigger sell-offs, though current sentiment remains optimistic. Expert Predictions and Market Outlook Experts have made bullish predictions, adding to the market’s upward momentum. Anthony Scaramucci predicts Bitcoin could reach $170,000 in the next year, Michael Saylor highlights a supply shock post-halving, and Tom Lee forecasts $150,000 short-term and $500,000 in five years, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Digital Coin Price estimates an average of $210,644.67 in 2025, with a peak at $230,617.59, while Wallet Investor projects $103,675 in one year and $196,072 in five years. These predictions, while speculative, reflect strong market fundamentals and growing institutional trust. Controversies and Bearish Concerns Despite the bullish outlook, there are concerns, including Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and evolving anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, as noted in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Some experts, like Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence, predict potential corrections, with Bitcoin dropping 20% in 2025 while gold surged 16%, as reported by [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]). However, these bearish views are not the consensus, with most analysts expecting continued growth due to institutional support. Technical Analysis and Price Movements Technical indicators also support the bullish trend. Based on data from April 22, 2025, Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is expected to rise to $93,964 by May 22, 2025, and the 50-day SMA to $104,173, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.80 indicating a neutral position, as per [CoinCodex]([invalid url, do not cite]). Bitcoin tested the lower trendline of an ascending channel pattern in March 2025, leading to bounces of 7.50%, 6.60%, and 7.60%, facing resistance at $87,830, as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Comparative Performance Bitcoin has appreciated faster than the S&P 500 and gold, currently at 10% of gold’s market cap, with potential to reach 20% in 2025 and 25% long-term, equating to $250,000, as per CNBC. This performance underscores its role as a reserve asset, with increasing recognition through exchange-traded products (ETPs) and adoption trends. Detailed Breakdown of Factors Conclusion Bitcoin’s price surge as of April 23, 2025, is a result of institutional adoption, favorable regulations, macroeconomic trends, the April 2024 halving, and bullish market sentiment. While controversies like environmental impact exist, the consensus leans towards continued growth, supported by expert predictions and technical indicators. Investors should remain cautious of potential corrections, but the current trajectory suggests a robust bull run. Key Citations Key Points Recent Price Surge Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase, reaching over $93,000 recently, likely due to increased demand from institutional investors and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. These ETFs, expected to manage over $250 billion by 2025, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors. Regulatory and Political Influence Favorable regulatory developments, especially under the new U.S. administration following Donald Trump’s re-election, have boosted investor confidence. Trump’s pro-crypto policies, including plans for a national Bitcoin reserve, have created a bullish market sentiment. Economic Factors Lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve, with dovish signals earlier in 2025, have made Bitcoin more attractive as an inflation hedge, reducing the opportunity cost of holding it compared to other investments. Market Dynamics The April 2024 halving, which reduced Bitcoin’s supply, historically triggers price increases due to increased scarcity. Additionally, the market is in a growth phase, aligning with a four-year cycle, with experts predicting a peak between 2024 and 2025.

Earlier in 2025, the Fed signaled dovish policies, expecting to cut interest rates twice, and kept the benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging tariff-driven inflation as “transitory,” as reported by Cointelegraph. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, making it an attractive inflation hedge. This is supported by Bitcoin’s 83% correlation with global liquidity, as noted in Finance Magnates, amid rising U.S. debt and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin Halving and Supply Dynamics The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which reduced miner rewards, has historically been a bullish trigger for prices. This event, occurring every four years, reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, increasing scarcity and supporting price appreciation. Historical data shows post-halving price increases, such as reaching $1,100 in November 2013 and $64,000 in April 2021, as discussed in Swan Bitcoin. The 2024 halving, combined with sustained demand, has contributed to the current bull run, as noted by CNBC. Market Sentiment and Historical Cycles The crypto market is currently in a growth phase, potentially peaking between 2024 and 2025, aligning with the historical four-year market cycle, as per Changelly. Positive news, such as regulatory acceptance and technological advancements, has created a bullish sentiment, while social media and online forums have influenced retail investor decisions, as discussed in OSL. Fear of missing out (FOMO) has led to sudden buying surges, further driving prices, while fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can trigger sell-offs, though current sentiment remains optimistic. Expert Predictions and Market Outlook Experts have made bullish predictions, adding to the market’s upward momentum. Anthony Scaramucci predicts Bitcoin could reach $170,000 in the next year, Michael Saylor highlights a supply shock post-halving, and Tom Lee forecasts $150,000 short-term and $500,000 in five years, as reported by Changelly. Digital Coin Price estimates an average of $210,644.67 in 2025, with a peak at $230,617.59, while Wallet Investor projects $103,675 in one year and $196,072 in five years. These predictions, while speculative, reflect strong market fundamentals and growing institutional trust. Controversies and Bearish Concerns Despite the bullish outlook, there are concerns, including Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and evolving anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, as noted in Changelly. Some experts, like Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence, predict potential corrections, with Bitcoin dropping 20% in 2025 while gold surged 16%, as reported by Finance Magnates. However, these bearish views are not the consensus, with most analysts expecting continued growth due to institutional support. Technical Analysis and Price Movements Technical indicators also support the bullish trend. Based on data from April 22, 2025, Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is expected to rise to $93,964 by May 22, 2025, and the 50-day SMA to $104,173, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.80 indicating a neutral position, as per CoinCodex. Bitcoin tested the lower trendline of an ascending channel pattern in March 2025, leading to bounces of 7.50%, 6.60%, and 7.60%, facing resistance at $87,830, as reported by Cointelegraph. Comparative Performance Bitcoin has appreciated faster than the S&P 500 and gold, currently at 10% of gold’s market cap, with potential to reach 20% in 2025 and 25% long-term, equating to $250,000, as per CNBC. This performance underscores its role as a reserve asset, with increasing recognition through exchange-traded products (ETPs) and adoption trends. Conclusion Bitcoin’s price surge as of April 23, 2025, is a result of institutional adoption, favorable regulations, macroeconomic trends, the April 2024 halving, and bullish market sentiment. While controversies like environmental impact exist, the consensus leans towards continued growth, supported by expert predictions and technical indicators. Investors should remain cautious of potential corrections, but the current trajectory suggests a robust bull run. Key Citations When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

As Tesla (TSLA) prepares to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings after the bell Tuesday, investors are watching closely for updates on two long-delayed projects: the company’s affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi platform. The two initiatives once were expected to define Tesla’s next chapter — but concerns about CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements are clouding the outlook. Analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk’s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand. Tesla’s stock has plunged 40% year-to-date, impacted by falling deliveries, fierce competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD (BYDDY), and political headwinds. But there’s one group of investors that’s thriving: short sellers. According to S3 Partners, traders betting against Tesla have made an estimated $11.5 billion in profits so far this year — making it the most profitable short globally, surpassing Nvidia (NVDA). Short interest has climbed 15% as bearish sentiment builds. Public perception is also shifting. A recent CNBC (CMCSA) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand’s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce. But with investor nerves fraying, Tesla’s Q1 report could be a decisive moment in the company’s 2025 story — for bulls and bears alike.

Title: Google's next move shows us why cozying up to leaders is a bad idea!

Summary: A new report states that Google might move Pixel production over to India. This is a move to avoid the harsh 46% tariffs placed on Taiwan, which is where most of Google’s devices are built. In India, the tariffs are only 26%, which is significantly lower. Do you remember hearing the news of wealthy tech figures donating money to Donald Trump’s inauguration by the millions? We saw Tim Cook do it along with Mark Zuckerberg and others. Well, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, also donated money to the inauguration. That’s what makes this new report all the more tragic. The very man they donated to is wreaking havoc on the global economy. He’s also playing chicken with countries that build many of the products we use every day, and this has caused huge vibrations throughout the stock market. Google is now starting to feel the pressure from the situation, and its next move should be a cautionary tale. As you may know, President Donald Trump is dealing out tariffs like he’s at a poker game. As such, importing goods from many countries around the world will become much more expensive. These taxes will result in higher prices for consumers, but it will also result in high prices for companies providing goods and services. Google’s Pixel devices are built in Taiwan, but that country was hit with a 46% tariff. This means that importing its Pixel devices from Taiwan over to the U.S. will cost the company more. Raising the import cost could result in much more expensive devices for the consumers. Pixel phones aren’t exactly the budget-friendly option it once was. A new report hints that Google is in talks with Dixon Technologies and Foxconn at the moment. It could be planning on moving Pixel production over to India. As it stands, India was hit with a 26% tariff, which is much lower than Taiwan’s tariff. The situation is extremely fluid at the moment. Vice President Vance flew over to India to speak with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The talks were over potentially reaching a trade deal later this year. If that happens, then things might be better for Google if it moves production to India. We’re sure that the executives over at Apple have been pulling their hair out over the drama. The sky-high tariffs placed on Chinese goods have been threatening to triple the price of the iPhone. As such, Apple has been asking the president to exempt it from the tariffs. Even though there was an exemption, the company could still be in trouble. Well, it looks like the folks at Google are in a similar boat. We all know that Trump favors big business, so we’re sure that’s why they donated to his inaugural fund. We’re also sure that it’s because he relaxed the regulations on AI technology, which companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI were happy about. However, now they’re regretting their choice at the moment. We’re seeing turmoil across several industries, and companies are having to uproot their operations. While the trade deal might help Google if it moves to India, it’s still ridiculous that the company now has to move its production to an entirely different country just to deal with a decision from the man that its CEO helped get re-elected.

Bitcoin (BTC) has tagged the $91,500 level for the first time since March 7th as institutional holdings of the flagship crypto asset enjoy a significant boost. According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, BlackRock and several other large US institutions have upped their Bitcoin stacks to back their BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Says Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, “BTC is back to $90,000. Fidelity, BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise are all accumulating BTC.” According to crypto data aggregator SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw $381 million in flows on Monday, April 21, with none of the 12 ETFs seeing net outflows. The flows are the largest recorded since January 30. However, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs haven’t seen the same amount of demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs have suffered net outflows for the majority of days since mid-February, including today. But some under-the-radar whales have been spotted on-chain accumulating ETH from crypto exchanges. Says Lookonchain, “Whales are still accumulating ETH. 0xd81E withdrew 1,900 ETH ($3.1M) from Gate.io again [on Tuesday]. Since Feb 15, this wallet has withdrawn 48,477 ETH ($100.35M) from Gate.io and is currently sitting on a $21M loss. Meanwhile, 0x3bd2 withdrew 2,600 ETH ($4.26M) from Binance after being inactive for a year.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,777 while ETH is priced at $1,692.

Title: A software engineer's success often depends on their relationship with their manager, says ex-Amazon technical director
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/software-engineer-success-can-depend-manager-relationship-former-amazon-director-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-22T17:41:33Z
Full Content:
A large part of an engineer's success is often tied to how they navigate their relationship with their manager, a former Amazon engineering director, Dave Anderson, said. "I would actually say, as a manager, even, like 50% of that performance, frequently, is your relationship with your manager and your team. How will you fit in with the team, with your peers, with your manager?" he said on a recent episode of "The Pragmatic Engineer," a podcast. Underestimating your supervisor's influence can be particularly dangerous at a company like Amazon, he added. As can be the case at other companies, a manager's decisions can shape the future of their direct report, from determining how much they're compensated to how far up the career ladder they climb. The influence a manager can have over an engineer's trajectory isn't something to shrug off, Anderson said. "I think the mistake that people will sometimes make is like, 'My manager doesn't influence my job that much because I can work independently,' or, you know, 'I don't need to figure this out with my manager because I can, you know, work with my peers, or I have this great engineer on my team I can work with,'" Anderson said. But if your manager doesn't like you, he added, you're "never ever" going to be able to snag a promotion. It's also important to remember that managers are often asked to point out a number of team members "who are not doing great," Anderson said. If you are, when compared with other members of your team, the "least effective," he added, you could be on the chopping block. "If you look around the room and you're thinking, 'Yep, I'm the worst one here' — that's not a great situation to ever be in. It's just never safe," Anderson said. "And at Amazon, it's definitely not safe. Some other companies where they just might do layoffs once every four years, you might be safe for quite a while. But Amazon has this sort of regular cycle." In response to a request for comment from Business Insider, Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said Anderson's experiences were his alone. "These claims reflect the opinion of one individual who worked at Amazon years ago. They're not based in fact, and aren't indicative of what it was like to work here then or what it's like today," Callahan said. "We're proud to be one of the most sought-after employers in the world and to have ranked in the top three in LinkedIn's Top Companies for eight years running." Anderson said that if an engineer's relationship with their manager isn't good, there can be an escape hatch of sorts: moving teams before being managed out. "So many times I've had someone who was either doing amazing on one team, they moved to the next team, and they're, like, actually not doing well at all, or someone who was not doing well escapes to another team before they get fired — and they do well," he said. If you start to hear rumblings from further up the chain of command, Anderson thinks it could be in your best interest to make a change, and swiftly. "This is, like, my sneaky recommendation for anyone is like — if you start to hear performance feedback whatsoever from your management chain, if you have any opportunity at all, get off your team fast as possible," he said. In a follow-up email, Anderson told BI that in a "great number of situations," he'd seen success prove itself to be at least partially dependent on team fit. "I've seen poor performers turn into great performers, and great performers turn into poor performers — and the only factor was them switching teams," he said. "In particular, switching teams to a place where they didn't know their manager. I don't think people fundamentally changed — so the only reasonable conclusion is that team fit (in particular, their relationship with their manager) is the deciding factor." Anderson doesn't suggest disavowing any negative feedback you receive and bailing out into a different section of the company on a whim. It depends, he said, on the relationship you've formed with your supervisor and whether you have faith in their advice. "Now, if you trust your manager, they might be actually just giving you honest feedback, which you'd like to be able to receive," he said. "But for the most part, if you've been working for someone for three years and suddenly they start giving you performance feedback, that's a really bad sign." Anderson added: "If you run for the hills fast enough, it's possible you'll get away before they flag you in the system as non-transferable." Jump to

April 22, 2025 13:33 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Elon Musk news: What happens to Tesla stock if index funds stop buying it?

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. I invest in Tesla every month when I make my 401(k) contribution. You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

ByJacob Wolinsky ByJacob Wolinsky, Contributor. NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 16: A sign hangs on the BlackRock offices on January 16, 2014 in New York ... More City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Value stocks bounced in the second half of last year, and several experts are saying the day of value is returning. However, BlackRock is warning that investors might be underweight value stocks at a time when the markets could start shifting. Additionally, history has shown that savvy stock picking is a better way to gain access to value stocks rather than by tracking one of the value indexes. Here are four value stock picks from two leading managers as the second quarter goes into full swing. In a recent interview, Judson Traphagen of Plough Penny Partners chose Lesaka Technologies (NASDAQ:LSAK) and Veon (NASDAQ:VEON), which are trading at around $4.50 and $45 a share, respectively. Meanwhile, Alyx Wood of Kernow Asset Management selected Card Factory (LON:CARD) and Kistos (LON:KIST), which are trading at around GBX90 and GBX129 a share. Plough Penny Partners is a long-biased, fundamental growth fund that prefers to target holding periods of between three to five years. The fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 long positions with a handful of opportunistic shorts. Plough Penny specifically targets high-growth technology companies, investing globally in fintech, software and internet companies. Kernow Asset Management uses a long-short equity strategy in search of contrarian alpha from U.K. equities. The firm pairs fundamental analysis with catalyst-driven mean reversion investments. Kernow seeks market inefficiencies and tries to determine how they work and how valuation gaps might be closed. Traphagen describes Lesaka as an under-the-radar small-cap fintech company undergoing secular growth and in the early stages of a multi-year trajectory. The company’s business is largely in southern Africa. Comparing Lesaka to StoneCo and Nubank in Latin America, Traphagen believes it’s perhaps the best way for U.S. investors to target Africa’s largely untapped growth market for fintech. In the same way Square serves U.S. customers, Lesaka provides digital financial solutions to consumers and merchants in southern Africa. Traphagen was initially drawn to Lesaka Technologies because he’s always seeking companies with great management, rapid revenue growth, and expanding margins that are operating in massive total addressable markets. He also seeks companies with solid unit economics and that have “barely penetrated their target markets.” “We have made money in emerging markets fintech stocks like Nubank and StoneCo in Latin America and had read that Africa was the next big market in fintech, so we looked for a stock to benefit from that trend,” Traphagen explained. “LSAK is that stock.” In the short term, he believes Lesaka Technologies is worth $7.50 a share, but he suspects it might end up being a multi-bagger in the long term. Veon is a telecommunications company that operates in frontier markets, providing traditional telco services and newer digital products and services. In recent years, it has sped up its digital products and services and now generates a sizable share of its revenues from digital products and services. Like with Lesaka, Traphagen believes the opportunity in Veon exists because it’s still largely unknown to U.S. investors, operating in markets that are essentially alien to U.S. investors, although it trades on the Nasdaq. Traphagen was initially attracted to Veon because of its valuation, but then he discovered its “compelling” total addressable market and opportunity for digital products in an area where competition by U.S. technology companies is lacking. He also was attracted to Veon because the company is ambitiously de-levering, selling off non-core assets and repurchasing shares. Card Factory is a top greeting card retailer in the U.K. that also sells gifts, party supplies and related products. The company was founded based on the opportunity to sell greeting cards at much lower price points than competitors via a vertically integrated business model that includes manufacturing cards in-house. Interestingly, Wood was initially drawn to Card Factory as a potential short position during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the company had high debt and was facing the possibility of bankruptcy. However, after Wood ran the fundamentals and conducted the people and strategy work, he found the company to be of higher quality than he had expected. “This made it a long idea as soon as they started growing profits and the debt was cleared by cashflow,” Wood explained. “The business is trading at a distressed price. This is at odds to the great balance sheet, and profits are set to double. It’s a hidden quality growth stock. So we did more work and linked our trade journey to the partnerships, which are free growth centers.” Management expects to double their profits over the next three years, although Wood said the market is skeptical because of the seemingly untested partnerships and international expansion. However, he added that they’re “comfortable with being paid to take the risk for free.” Those partnerships are basically new places where Card Factory’s cards are being sold on stands within stores rather than just on the High Street. Kistos is an independent, integrated energy company that has both upstream and midstream operations that span international markets. Wood was initially drawn to the stock by the 350% gap with their valuation in the Kernow Valuation Framework, which begins with valuing companies using their proprietary fundamental bottom-up process. He feels Kistos has a clear edge over other oil and gas companies because it extracts value from overlooked assets “more efficiently than almost anyone else.” Wood estimates the company’s intrinsic value at £350 million, although its market cap is only a mere £100 million currently. He said the company’s production is set to almost double this year to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the market is ignoring this potential. According to BlackRock, growth stocks accounted for 37% of the S&P 500 as of the end of November, versus the historical average of 24%. This was due to the heavy favoritism assigned to growth stocks in the first half of 2024 as investors widely preferred mega-cap technology stocks. However, that high concentration could unintentionally leave many investor portfolios coming up short in the diversification department, meaning a greater chance of missing out on the upside from rallies in value stocks like the one that started in July 2024. Thus, investors might want to take a closer look at their portfolios to see where they stand in the value-versus-growth.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/22/2025 7:51:17 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Now that Pat Gelsinger is no longer occupying the corner office at embattled chipmaker Intel (INTC), he can acknowledge one thing about the semiconductor industry.Nvidia (NVDA) has a wide, wide lead over its rivals on the tech front..."They have built meaningful moats around their franchise," he added.Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around Intel for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).He was fired in early December amid missed financial targets, lack of progress on the AI chip front, and a cash drain on the foundry business.Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.Analysts think Nvidia may post upward of $5 per share in earnings in 2025. Nvidia's stock is up 1,220% over the past five years, while Intel's has dropped 69%.Intel announced Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO in March.Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with Gelsinger over how to position the business.Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel...Tan will get to outline his strategy publicly -- and detail how he will navigate Trump tariffs -- when the company announces first quarter results on April 24 after the market close.

Intel Agencies Caught in Massive Voter Fraud USAWatchdog.com ^ | 4FEB2025 | Greg Hunter Posted on 2/5/2025, 10:19:32 AM by Tom Tetroxide Dr. Jerome Corsi has a Harvard PhD in political science. He has written more than 30 books with many of them becoming best-sellers. Dr. Corsi’s latest project is about voter fraud. Corsi says he can prove Donald Trump really did win in 2020. There were also countless down-ballot thefts in 2020 and in 2024. Dr. Corsi and others have uncovered a grand scam that dates back to the early 2000’s that has cheated people into office that actually lost. The architects of the steal can be traced back to U.S. intel agencies. Dr. Corsi created a website for this project called GodsFiveStones.com and explains, “GodsFiveStones.com is named after the David and Goliath Bible story. This is when David picks up five smooth stones from the brook, and they are the exact ones needed to kill Goliath. That’s what we are aiming to do is to kill this Goliath of voter fraud.” The voter fraud is hidden in the voter rolls that every state government maintains. Corsi says, “You look at state records, and there might be 12 million records and there might be 2 million false records. They look legitimate until you really analyze them, and then you realize they are duplicates or clones. If you send out people to canvas them, there is nobody there. They are falsified and hidden in the data base. It’s like a card marking scheme. . . . They did not use the algorithms in the 2024 Election for President because we were on the lookout for it. The down-ballot elections (House, Governor and Senate) used these algorithms, and they cheated.” Corsi estimates they cheated 20 House Democrats and 5 Democrat Senators into office in 2024. snip I recommend “The nVidia Way” book. It’s an interesting read, much of the success is around their culture. Jensen just outworks everyone, requiring it of everyone. They behave as though the next breakthrough in tech will kill the company, so be first and never get complacent. That said, it seems he sacrifices his life to just work. I was in a company bought by Intel. They were constantly distracted by different ideas. They seemed to have no focus. They also didn’t listen, there was a certain arrogance about the Intel employees. They’re way behind in AI hardware and software. It’s not just the hardware. The CUDA software opened doors into unanticipated markets. That said, from a stock point of view, imho...they’re going to enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ on the Gartner Hype Cycle. The possibilities hit regulatory aspects. The recent market performance may be reflecting this but it’s hard to see due to the other volatility (e.g. tariffs). Long term buy, looking for another dip - over 30% down since start of the year. I used to work for Intel, but I was in and out before Pat came to power. But a good friend who worked there for a LONG time used to work for Pat and says that he’s a very smart engineer, and he thought the right person for the job as CEO. When things didn’t go so well under his leadership my friend said he believed the issue was that Pat was an engineer, and that the board of directors (who make all the decisions ANYWAY), didn’t WANT an engineer to lead the company, they wanted more of a finance guy. So here we are. A different world but when I was supporting government development projects the two big leaders would be Program Manager (focusing on Cost and Schedule) and Chief Engineer (focusing on technical requirements). I never worked with a Chief Engineer who gave a fig about technical requirements. The Chief Engineers always focused on Cost and Schedule. Always the money. Never the engineering. I know a bunch of former Intel people who now work at AMD they say Intel is in a death spiral and while AMD needs to spend and upgrade their Server lab spaces they are poised to kick some Intel ass. The only thing the new CEO brings is customer feedback on fabless design needs. True something very missing from Intel but it might not be enough. DEI has destroyed the inner workings of Intel started by Obama. It has not been the same place since Paul Otellini retired. Intel had a long track record of forcing out experienced people and replacing them with Indian workers. Those experienced engineers went to AMD, Nvidia, Apple and IBM. I went to IBM where for the first time after 30 years, felt like I was being treated like a professional. You were just a number at Intel.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed despite a stronger U.S. dollar overnight, gold surging, and yesterday’s U.S. equity downdraft, as Taiwan underperformed. The Yen was resilient, giving some validation to today’s Financial Times article on Japanese institutions selling U.S. Treasuries, though it is hard to say for sure. The U.S. dollar’s decline, stock market decline, and asset flow out of the U.S. were topics in Chinese media, though likely being repeated globally. The positions of star active fund managers, revealing their positions, garnered attention on a light economic data and policy day. One manager’s top positions were revealed as Tencent, Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, Meituan, Wuliangye, Yum China, and CNOOC. Another manager focused solely on Mainland China A shares revealed holdings in Sokon, Eve, Naura, and Trina Solar. After the close, Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the financial arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, updated its positions in four Mainland equity ETFs with increases of 363 million shares, 501 million shares, 117 million shares, and 157 million shares. The SWF’s positions are in the tens of billions, so the Q1 increases aren’t massive in my opinion. Coincidentally, Reuters published an article on retail investors and the National Team buying during market hours that garnered attention. There continues to be coverage of the government’s rare statements on stabilizing the stock market. Hong Kong’s volumes were strong on a positive day. JD.com was down -6.32% and Meituan was down -4.62%, as they battle for restaurant delivery, which weighed on both stocks as investors fear margin compression. The outcome of these pyrrhic victories has been painful to watch, as firms undercut one another to garner market share, as profitability falls to the wayside. This reminds me of the battle between Uber and Didi. Mainland investors bought a very large net $2.753 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, Tencent, and Alibaba were the largest beneficiaries of inflows. 50% of Hong Kong turnover was from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Healthcare was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, up +6.52%, and Mainland China, up +0.49%, on the belief that the sector will be resilient to the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland technology and growth stocks, including electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and electrical equipment, underperformed. A sell-side economist dropped their 2025 China GDP target to 4% from 4.5%. Hong Kong and Mainland China’s resilience has garnered shockingly little attention from global investors. The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target visited President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday. While the companies’ statements called the meeting “productive” and “constructive,” the companies and their customers will unfortunately be adversely impacted by tariffs. Hopefully, the U.S. and China can make some progress, as some have speculated that Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s visit to Beijing could be his attempt to act as a bridge between the two sides.

This Grow a Garden Candy Blossom guide tells you how to afford this event seed for yourself, its general stats, and why it’s the meta! Start planting your plot on Roblox. For more on the Easter Event, check out my Easter Store guide, telling you how to unlock it and the available stock. Introduced for the Easter Event 2025, the Candy Blossom is the first-ever Divine Event plant added to Grow a Garden. It appears in the limited Easter Store run by the Poppy NPC, located in the centre of the island. To unlock Poppy’s wares, she requires 30kg of Golden mutated produce first. Players don’t profit when giving her golden fruit, but the Candy Blossom tree easily makes back its worth when fully grown. The Event store restocks hourly on the hour (for example: 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and so on). If it’s in stock, the Candy Blossom seed costs 10,000,000$ to buy. Despite its hefty price tag, this plant is worth the investment since it’s one of the meta seeds available currently. It easily makes back the 10 million investment, thanks to it being a repeatable harvest plant. This means that unless you dig it up, it’ll remain forever as a timestamp to your contribution to the Easter Event. Huge flex! I created a full guide on getting cash quickly if you want to know all the available methods. For now, I recommend buying as many Red Lollipops from the Easter Shop as possible. They cost 45,000$ per seed, which seems steep, however, the seeds grow at the same rate as the Carrots. This means they’re great for turning quick profit since even on the smaller side, they sell for over their 45,000$ seed price. Plus, being uncommon in rarity, this means they’re often available during stock updates. When selling your Red Lollipops, you can increase their value further if you have a friend online. Per a friend on your server, you gain a 10% selling bonus, which stacks! Copyright 2025 Droid Gamers Inc. - All Rights Reserved. - Privacy Policy

Good morning. A new research paper co-authored by Google's David Silver is the talk of the tech industry. It boldly announces a radical new era for AI — it also reads as a "dis" of OpenAI, BI's Alistair Barr writes. In today's big story, Tesla's highly anticipated earnings report comes after the bell. We're breaking down what Wall Street will be watching — and why Tesla really wants the Cybertruck to be a working man's truck. What's on deck Markets: President Trump escalated his feud with the Fed, and investors are nervous. Tech: Internal Microsoft email to managers details new policies aimed at culling low performers. Business: The FTC is arguing that Uber's subscription service is too deceptive in a new suit. But first, bringing the Cybertruck back to earth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The big story Think less DeLorean, more F-150. The Cybertruck is ditching its otherworldly aesthetic to reposition itself as a working man's vehicle, BI's Grace Kay writes. Less than two years after release, Cybertrucks are now piling up in sales lots, fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered, and some owners have become political targets over CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump. So, what's a car company to do? Enter the quiet rebrand. Tesla sales workers told BI the vehicle needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer. In mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars. Now, the vehicle is fit for construction work or a family outing. Tesla is preparing to deliver first-quarter earnings. It faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% this year. It's looking for a boost. Here are a few things that Wall Street will be watching: Impact of Trump tariffs. Tesla's chief financial officer said on the company's last earnings call that, if implemented, tariffs would affect the automaker's business and profitability. He said that while the company had tried to localize its supply chain, it's still "very reliant on parts from across the world" for all its businesses. 1. The "sell America" trade is in full swing. On Monday, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropped sharply. This followed Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for taking too long to lower interest rates, which is rattling investor confidence. 2. Politically meddling with the Fed is a bad idea, top official says. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee underscored the importance of the central bank's independence on Monday. He cautioned that political interference could result in hotter inflation and higher unemployment. 3. Companies are cutting earnings outlooks. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and recession fears are causing the revisions, which are approaching downside extremes. 1. Inside Amazon's Project Greenland. Last year, Amazon struggled to keep its retail business on track when faced with an AI chip shortage. Its response was Project Greenland: an effort to tightly approve and monitor which projects get GPU access, according to documents obtained by BI. 2. Microsoft is raising the bar. It has created new policies and tools to dial up performance pressure on employees, including a two-year rehire ban for those found to be underperforming, according to an internal email viewed by BI. 3. AI isn't ready to do your job. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University staffed a fake company with AI agents, and the results were disastrous. See the tasks AI failed the most — and where the next development phase is likely headed. 1. Are you stuck with Uber One? You're probably not alone. An FTC lawsuit accuses Uber of overpromising customers how much the paid subscription service will save them, making it too hard to cancel, and, in some cases, signing them up without consent. Uber denies the allegations. 2. Walmart's taking a page from the honeybee playbook. The retail giant is ditching zip codes for a honeycomb-style segmented map in search of speedier grocery delivery. It says the goal is to understand what customers want, where they are, and which stores have what they need. 3. How CEOs are staying calm. As uncertainty swirls over tariffs, many CEOs are turning to their wellness routines to reduce stress. Business leaders shared their tips with BI, from "purposeful scrolling" to finding balance outdoors.

Title: AMD Stock To $60?

(Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Imagine waking up to see AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) down 30%. Sounds ridiculous? It’s not. We aren’t talking about a single day drop - but sustained selling triggered by risks that are piling up leading to a big reset in valuation. If this stock reverts to anything close to a sane multiples, we’re talking a drop to $60 or even lower - and that’s without a full-blown tech meltdown. That’s the kind of risk that exists with individual stocks, or if your portfolio is too concentrated. We minimize this risk while giving exposure to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s pull back the curtain on AMD. Just from the numbers that matter, AMD looks a lot like Google at first glance. But PE multiples? Different like night and day. AMD is trading almost at 85 PE while Google is sitting below 19. Why such a massive difference? The answer: margins! AMD has a very low net margin of 6.4% compared to Google’s 28.6% (last 12 months) - which means low income and exceptionally high PE. In other words, the market is expecting significant margin expansion from AMD - but that dream might blow up. Here is what the numbers really mean. So what’s propping it up? Expectations. And those are starting to wobble. Sure, earnings might look “fine” on the surface. But watch the guidance like a hawk. That’s where the truth slips out. If AMD blinks even a little in forward guidance, Wall Street’s love affair could end fast. The semiconductor industry isn’t new to booms and busts. We’ve seen this movie before. AMD is not immune. Remember 2022? AMD dropped from $160 to under $60 in just months. And it wasn’t because AMD failed - it was because the expectations collapsed. That wasn’t the only time this happened. In 2018, AMD dropped nearly 50% in < 1.5 months as the market corrected in October. All we are saying is - stay cautious! Does it mean you shouldn’t invest in stocks like AMD? No, we aren’t saying that. AMD has provided excellent returns for investors. But stocks like AMD should be just a small part of the portfolio. There is much more to long-term money compounding. Consider Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

LOS ANGELES, California — Mayor Karen Bass tried to strike an upbeat tone as she delivered the bad news Monday in her “State of the City” speech, cutting 400 civilian jobs in the L.A. Police Department next year. The Los Angeles Times reported: Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a proposed budget on Monday that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting more than 2,700 city positions — about 1,650 of them through layoffs. … The $14 billion spending plan, which covers the 2025-26 fiscal year, would provide funding for scores of new hires at the fire department, three months after the Palisades fire destroyed thousands of homes and killed 12 people. … At the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 400 workers would be targeted for layoffs, all of them civilians, according to figures prepared by city budget officials. The number of police officers would continue on its gradual downward trajectory, with new hires failing to keep pace with attrition. Bass also claimed that the process of recovery and building after the Palisades Fire was the fastest in the history of the state: Today, in reporting on the State of our City, I report to Los Angeles that the recovery in the Palisades is on track to be the fastest in California history. We’re not just moving fast to move fast. We know that the faster we can rebuild, the faster we can heal. We still have a long way to go, and for those who have lost a home, each and every day is a day too long. We want to be fast, we want to be safe and we want to be resilient. We have issued permits to rebuild twice as fast as after the Camp and Woolsey fires, we restored water nearly a year and a half faster than after the Camp Fire, and we restored power in just two months. Los Angeles, I assure you, rebuilding is underway. Many residents, frustrated by delays in debris removal, building permits, and insurance company payouts, would disagree. Bass said the city would start using AI technology to speed up the process of approving building permits, and called on the City Council “to pass an ordinance to waive all plan check and permit fees so that Angelenos can get home.” However, skeptical residents are running out of time. And many refuse to forget that she was out of the country when the fires broke out in January, breaking a campaign promise to refuse international travel. Joel B.

Title: Americans Believe Russian Disinformation ‘To Alarming Degree’
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2025/04/22/americans-believe-russian-disinformation-to-alarming-degree/

ByEmma Woollacott ByEmma Woollacott, Senior Contributor. View of The national flag of the Russian Federation with view of St Basil's Cathedral at sunny day ... More in Moscow, Russia A third of Americans have fallen for Russian disinformation — and for other false online claims. An online survey carried out between February and March this year by leading market research and analytics organization YouGov, commissioned by data analysis and news rating firm NewsGuard, presented a nationally representative sample of 1,000 respondents with 10 false claims that have spread widely online. These included three that originated from or were mainly spread by Russian media outlets. Respondents were asked to mark each claim—all of which have been authoritatively and widely debunked—with a response of “True,” “False,” or “Not Sure.” And, the researchers found, Americans are falling for Kremlin disinformation to an alarming degree, along with other false claims relating to health and medicine, elections and international conflicts. Indeed, of the 10 false presented, 78% of respondents believed at least one, and fewer than 1 in 100 managed to correctly identify all 10 claims as false. A quarter believed, for example, that up to half the U.S. aid money given to Ukraine was stolen by Ukrainian officials for personal use. More than half incorrectly thought that Ukraine sold Hamas weapons that had been donated by the U.S. Meanwhile, fewer than half of respondents correctly identified as false the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed between 7.3 and 15 million people worldwide, while 1 in 5 said they believed the claim to be true. These claims were made on the basis of numbers described as arbitrary by experts, and not based on any research. "The false narrative is based on an inaccurate analysis of deaths reported after Covid vaccination to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a U.S. government database that collects unverified reports of adverse reports following vaccination," said NewsGuard. "The analysis was conducted by Edward Dowd, a former portfolio manager for investment management company BlackRock, who has no medical background and has previously made false claims about Covid-19 vaccines." Gullibility appears to cut across party lines, with respondents identifying as Democrats just as likely as Republicans to believe at least one of the 10 false claims. Republicans were, though, more likely to believe Russian disinformation claims than their Democratic counterparts, with 57.6% falling for at least one Russian disinformation claim, compared with just 17.9% of Democrats and 29.5% of people who didn't identify with one particular party. Russia is spending significant amounts on promulgating misinformation in the U.S. Last year, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two people for funneling nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish misinformation about Ukraine. And around the same time, the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors had been using to try and influence the 2024 elections. "An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia’s preferred outcome in the election," said then–attorney general Merrick Garland. "The sites we are seizing were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other countries," Garland added. All in all, said NewsGuard, Russian disinformation efforts targeting Americans continue to accelerate, and they’ve become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. "In the ongoing battle between fiction and reality, fiction—much of it created by Russia’s robust disinformation machine—appears to be winning," it warned.

Title: Stocks look to rebound as earnings roll in — but confusion still rules

Time Published: 2025-04-22T12:22:00Z

U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, capping off a dramatic comeback fueled by hopes of easing trade tensions and a softer stance on tariffs. The Dow surged 1,017 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 jumped 2.5% and the Nasdaq soared 2.7%. The Russell 2000 outpaced them all, up nearly 2.8%, signaling broad-based enthusiasm — at least for now. Volatility retreated, with the VIX dropping over 9%, and investors rotated out of safe havens. After rising to fresh highs overnight, gold fell 1.2% to $3,383 an ounce, snapping a record-setting streak even as JPMorgan (JPM) analysts said they still see a path to $4,000 an ounce in the months ahead. Meanwhile, Bitcoin popped 5% to break above $90,000 for the first time since March, with some traders viewing crypto as a hedge against ongoing policy whiplash. Not all stocks participated in the rally. Defense contractors took a hit after earnings reports showed margin compression and rising tariff risks. Northrop Grumman plunged 12.5% — the worst performer in the S&P 500 — after reporting a steep drop in profit tied to cost overruns on the B-21 bomber program. RTX slid over 9% after warning that tariffs could slash up to $850 million from its 2025 profits. The rest of the market took a more optimistic view. Tesla gained almost 5% ahead of earnings, Netflix (NFLX) jumped over 5%, and GE Aerospace (GE) rallied 6% following a strong report. Still, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent scheduled to speak Wednesday on the financial system — and the political backdrop still wildly unpredictable — few believe today’s rally settles the score. Stocks climbed on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told a private gathering that the ongoing trade war with China is “unsustainable” and likely to “de-escalate.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose just over 2% by late afternoon, buoyed by optimism over potential relief from steep tariffs that have weighed on global markets. However, analysts caution that the rally may be premature. Despite Bessent’s comments, there have been no formal negotiations between the U.S. and China to date, and much of social media greeted these latest deal hints with skepticism. The Trump administration’s recent tariff hikes remain in effect, including a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and additional levies pushing some Chinese goods to a 145% tariff rate. The International Monetary Fund has also weighed in, warning that the current tariff policies have delivered a significant negative shock to the global economy, prompting a downgrade in growth forecasts. While the market’s reaction reflects hope for a resolution, the situation underscores the volatility and uncertainty that continue to characterize U.S.-China trade relations. U.S. stocks rebounded strongly Tuesday after a brutal start to the week, even as investors remain rattled by a barrage of conflicting signals on recession risks — and by President Donald Trump’s escalating pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,035 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 also added 2.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 3%. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped almost 10%, signaling a cooldown in volatility. Gold continued its climb, up 0.4% to $3,439. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, a decrease from the previous estimate of 3.3%, citing the impact of widespread tariffs and escalating trade tensions under President Donald Trump. The U.S. economy is now projected to grow at 1.8%, down from 2.7%, with the IMF raising the probability of a U.S. recession this year to 37%, up from 25%. The IMF attributes the slowdown to increased uncertainty, reduced investment, and tighter credit conditions resulting from the tariffs, which affect nearly 60 countries. Gold extended its historic rally overnight, climbing above $3,500 for the first time. The surge likely reflects a dual concern: Investors are chasing safety amid political and market chaos, while bracing for a potential resurgence in inflation fueled by Trump’s tariffs. Last week, investors poured $8 billion into gold funds — double the peak weekly inflows seen during the pandemic — pushing the four-week average to $4 billion, according to Bank of America Global Research (BAC). Meanwhile, traders on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, continue to price in elevated odds of a U.S. recession by the end of 2025. Also on Monday, the U.S. dollar plunged to a three-year low after Trump ramped up attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, intensifying calls for interest rate cuts and deepening fears over the central bank’s independence. “The market no longer knows what to believe,” wrote The Kobeissi Letter, pointing to a swirl of conflicting cues: gold rising like cuts are coming, stocks falling like a recession is near, and Treasury yields climbing like the economy is booming. Tesla (TSLA) reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with Wall Street bracing for more bad news. Wells Fargo (WFC) expects a Q1 miss, citing weak deliveries, shrinking margins, and fading enthusiasm for the Cybertruck. The firm also slashed its 2025 outlook by 16%, pointing to soft demand for the refreshed Model Y and mounting doubts around speculative bets like the Cybercab and Optimus. Tesla stock rose more than 6% in Tuesday afternoon trading after slumping on Monday. Its shares are down about 36% so far this year. Shares of Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet rose 3% Tuesday. The stock had slipped more than 2% on Monday after the Justice Department asked a federal judge to break up the company, possibly by forcing it to sell off its Chrome browser. Beyond Tesla, a wave of major earnings Tuesday will offer a broader pulse check on the industrial and healthcare sectors. Results from Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Danaher (DHR), and Novartis (NVS) will provide fresh reads on medical tech and pharma trends. SAP (SAP) and Verizon (VZ) add visibility into enterprise tech and telecom, while Chubb’s (CB) results could shed light on how insurers are navigating a climate of rising risk and uncertainty. Defense is also in focus in a big way on Tuesday, with Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX (RTX) (formerly Raytheon Technologies) all reporting earings — offering investors a rare, same-day snapshot of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Together, the three giants cover everything from missile systems to fighter jet engines to battlefield surveillance, making their earnings a bellwether for how rising global tensions and Pentagon budgets are filtering into the sector.

Title: Want to Understand the New Cold War? Look to Huawei.

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The tech company has come to symbolize the ongoing struggle between America and China. A Huawei store in Beijing, 2024. America’s political and economic elites were once unruffled by the rise of China. Yes, Chinese GDP was growing fast, and yes, China’s share of global trade was growing equally rapidly. But this did not—or, at least, did not seem to—challenge America’s ongoing economic dominance. After all, the dollar was still king. The size and depth of China’s stock market continued to be dwarfed by the United States’. GDP per capita still weighed heavily in America’s favor. And the acknowledged global heavyweights of Big Tech—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft—were American companies one and all. The basic posture vis-à-vis China was the following: You keep producing all that cheap stuff, we’ll keep on buying it, and you keep on financing the deficits that we accrue in the process. Over the last decade, all of this has unraveled. During his first term in the White House, Donald Trump introduced a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, which sparked retaliatory measures from China and growing talk of a “trade war.” Under Joe Biden, the inflammatory language of the Trump 1.0 era became less conspicuous. Rather, in a break with the hegemony of neoliberalism, the Biden White House hailed a renaissance in “industrial policy”; his flacks talked about no longer being able to rely on market mechanisms to guide investment. But even if the tone had changed, the policy content was not much different: China was in the crosshairs. If anything, Biden’s China tariffs were more severe than those he inherited. In mid-2024, tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum were raised to 25 percent, on solar cells and panels to 50 percent, on electric vehicles to 100 percent; and in a parting gift to his successor, in January 2025, just as Biden was leaving office, a 50 percent tariff on Chinese semiconductors went into effect. Notably, green technology was at the heart of Biden’s trade and China policy. In explaining his tariff hikes and their sectoral concentration, the Biden team repeatedly invoked the climate crisis and the energy transition, arguing that the only successful and sustainable global transition would be one where green technologies were not monopolized by a single country. US officials were well aware that monopolization was something that China was close to actually achieving. By 2023, China controlled the production of around 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth elements used in clean-energy products and at least 80 percent of the global solar-panel supply chain, with only slightly lower shares in wind turbines and EV batteries. Washington also looked with something like awe at China’s build-out of solar and wind power: The year after Biden’s historic “climate bill,” the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was passed to great domestic fanfare, China installed 10 times as much net new renewable capacity as America did. Under Trump 2.0, all emphasis on green technology has of course been buried (at least rhetorically, since the tariffs on China’s green tech were retained). But the tariff saber-rattling has nonetheless escalated into all-out trade warfare. In February, a 10 percent tariff was imposed on Chinese imports across the board, and in March, this was increased to 20 percent. Trump was just getting started, however: April 2, his “Liberation Day,” saw the blanket tariff rate on China raised to 54 percent; and at the time of this writing, after retaliatory Chinese measures, the US tariff rate on Chinese imports effectively totals 145 percent. What is increasingly clear is that after decades of cautious sparring, the rivalry between America and China—as the US regards it, at any rate—has become a battle for global economic supremacy. Certainly, the Trump administration has targeted many other countries too, but China is plainly the main antagonist. Not for nothing has the Chinese government accused the United States of “unilateral bullying.” What is also clear, though, is that underneath America’s bluster lurks a very real and very understandable fear: namely, that this is a battle that America might not win. In fact, more than that, this is a battle that America might have already lost; all the joking on social media that the United States has entered its own “Century of Humiliation”— China’s lasted from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century—cuts to the quick precisely because it expresses very real anxieties. If one company symbolizes the ongoing struggle between America and China, that company, arguably, is Huawei. In its early years, after it was founded in 1987, Huawei—a Chinese tech firm that focuses on telecommunications—was largely ignored in the US, to the extent that it was even acknowledged. In the 2000s and early 2010s, as the company grew and expanded, including in the United States itself, American business and policy elites generally tolerated Huawei, perceiving it, at worst, as an irritant. But since Trump’s first term as president, a new era has begun. Endlessly challenged and vitriolically attacked, Huawei has ascended to the status of Public Enemy No. 1, the very apotheosis of the Chinese “threat.” So why is Huawei treated with such hostility by US policymakers? Partly it’s about geopolitics. Though Huawei is an increasingly diversified enterprise, its main business, generating over half of total revenue, is the design, manufacture, and sale of telecom equipment such as networking infrastructure and the provision of ancillary services. Communications networks, of course, are integral to the ways in which states eavesdrop and spy on one another. America’s fear is that Huawei could or already does allow its products to be used to nefarious ends by the Chinese government. Ergo, it is deemed a threat to US national security. It is with this aspect of Huawei’s role in US-China relations that Eva Dou, a reporter for The Washington Post, is principally concerned in her new book, House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company. It has never been a secret that Huawei’s technologies are widely embedded in the contemporary surveillance state. The company has, for instance, been a major player since the 2000s in the international market for the chips used in surveillance cameras; Huawei was one of eight companies selected by Beijing in 1996 for a $1 billion national semiconductor development program. In China itself, what proved an especially lucrative opportunity for Huawei was President Xi Jinping’s launch in 2015 of a program—dubbed “Sharp Eyes”—aimed, Dou writes, at “blanketing the country with a network of security cameras.” In 2020, it was announced that China’s capital had no more blind spots: “Electronic eyes were watching over 100 percent of Beijing.” The same year, the Post revealed that Huawei had knowingly countenanced the use of its technology to track members of the Uyghur ethnic minority, prompting the French soccer star Antoine Griezmann to terminate his sponsorship deal with the company. While the Uyghur revelations certainly hardened what by that point was a growing US-led international turn against Huawei, policymakers in America and other Western markets have always been much more concerned about the security-related and political implications of Huawei’s presence in their own territories. Could Huawei’s gear be hacked, leading to network disruption? Could the Chinese government listen in on international network users? From the American perspective, the biographic details of Huawei’s legendary founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei—a background in the military (the Engineering Corps) and a member of the Chinese Communist Party since 1978—only redoubled the grounds for suspicion. “With Huawei increasingly integrated into global networks,” Dou writes of developments in the mid-2000s, “it was being watched closely by spy agencies.” Statements along these lines pepper the book; by the end, the reader may wonder why Dou spends quite so much time on the cloak-and-dagger stuff, given that she never does unearth a smoking gun of any kind. Nonetheless, she is quite right to highlight the staggering hypocrisy of the US government’s moral grandstanding about alleged Chinese espionage machinations. As the 2013–14 Snowden leaks demonstrated, America’s own National Security Agency had successfully infiltrated Huawei several years previously and was using its infrastructure to spy not just on the company but on a range of other public- and private-sector entities, both in China and around the world. “The irony,” as Huawei’s US spokesman, William Plummer, put it at the time, “is that exactly what they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.” No wonder, remarks Dou, that Washington had been “so confident that Beijing could use Huawei’s gear for snooping: the NSA had been doing exactly that for years.” For all the security concerns, however, the fact that Huawei is regarded as such a threat has to do with much more than “just” geopolitics. Equally important, and perhaps even more so, is the brute fact of Huawei’s staggering commercial success. One suspects that, consciously or otherwise, anxiety about Huawei’s competitive accomplishments is sometimes dressed up as a concern with “safety”: Far easier for the American mind to invoke a surveillance bogeyman than to admit to trepidatious reverence at Chinese business prowess. As late as the turn of the millennium, the international telecommunications hardware market—Huawei’s home turf—continued to be dominated by Western firms such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, and Nortel. But the first decade of the new millennium began to see a changing of the guard. A seminal moment, as Dou tells it, came with Huawei’s first major breakthrough in the West, when, in 2005, the company won a lucrative bid to upgrade the network of BT, Britain’s largest supplier of telephony services. Opening the door to, among others, the French and Spanish markets, the BT deal was the “beginning of the end for several of Huawei’s Western rivals,” who simply couldn’t compete with the company at its “budget price points.” By 2012, Huawei was the world’s largest vendor of telecommunications networking hardware. Having also successfully made the move into consumer electronics—branded household gadgets “could help Huawei soften its image overseas,” Dou notes—the Chinese firm was, for good measure, now the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, behind only Apple and Samsung. Sophie Lewis Elie Mystal Elie Mystal Jeet Heer Huawei has succeeded internationally despite America’s best efforts, especially in the past decade, to prevent it from doing so. The company had been on Washington’s radar since the late 1990s, not least because of its expansion in those years into markets presided over by what the US deemed “rogue” regimes, among them Iraq and Russia. The result was that, even after Huawei successfully made big sales in other Western territories after establishing its foothold in Britain, America would remain the one major market in which it failed to make significant inroads, having to satisfy itself there with sales to second- or third-tier network operators. As a potential supplier, the Chinese company was simply beyond the pale for America’s telephony market leaders, for whom political optics and relationships are considered just as important as capital costs and network quality. During the first Trump administration, the US expanded its campaign against Huawei on two new fronts. It imposed export controls, specifically by banning US companies from supplying Huawei with critical components, as they had been doing since as early as 1993, when Huawei established its first US subsidiary in California. And, with some notable successes, the US government also began applying substantial pressure on countries like Australia, Britain, and Canada to follow its lead in blackballing Huawei in their domestic markets, focusing on those countries’ tendering of contracts to build 5G networks. Huawei, however, has prevailed nonetheless, even as there is no doubt that America’s resistance has crimped the scope of its achievements. “The West was continuing to grow more inhospitable toward Huawei,” Dou says by way of bringing her story up to the time of her writing, in 2024. “Yet—almost incredibly—Huawei was still number one in the world in 5G gear sales.” Huawei’s prevailing in the face of the United States’ concerted opposition shows that America is not as powerful or persuasive as it certainly likes to imagine that it is: Not everyone, even its (erstwhile) “friends,” kowtows to its demands. Furthermore, and perhaps more significantly still, the Huawei story demonstrates that in the 21st century, non-Western companies are able to be enormous commercial successes—to be, in fact, world leaders in their chosen industry sectors—while having the US and several other leading Western markets essentially closed off to them. That, in itself, is a profound statement on the shifting of the world economic order, and one that Trump and his cronies evidently seem to be ignoring—or perhaps are unable to understand—as they set about alienating long-time commercial and political allies, in addition to the list of long-time adversaries, by unleashing an all-encompassing trade war the likes of which the world has not seen since the early 20th century. In the postwar era, it would have been unthinkable that a company could have ascended to global market leadership in any area of the economy without a major presence in the United States, Europe, or (more likely) both. That is no longer true. Alongside East Asia and Africa, it is the Middle East, with all its natural-resource-based riches, that represents, in Dou’s words, “the beating heart of Huawei’s global empire.” What is also maddening to Huawei’s American critics is that it has done all this while thumbing its nose at American-style capitalism. For many years, there was widespread expectation around the world, and among many in China itself, that Huawei would proceed to an IPO. This was assumed to be its “natural” evolutionary terminus, the inevitable result of the company’s inculcating, and eventually adopting, the Western gospel of shareholder value. But Huawei never did become a public company, and it never prioritized shareholder value to the exclusion of all else. It was, and is, something else entirely—and that something else has proved a great commercial success. What do we know about the model? Huawei began life as a contract manufacturer. That is, at the start, it did not have its own products, but manufactured those of others—including, most notably, simple analog telephone switches capable of routing and connecting, at most, a few dozen phone calls, which were sold to the likes of small offices and hotels. Huawei was initially a private company, controlled top to bottom by Ren Zhengfei himself and capitalized with the princely sum of 21,000 yuan provided by Ren and five private investors. Five years after its founding, by which time it had developed and begun to sell a first switch of its own (the BH-03), Huawei converted in 1992 to a “collectively owned enterprise,” a company structure that furnished both a degree of political patronage and a set of broader financing opportunities—and which, in Huawei’s case, appeared to entail a more democratic form of management in the shape, in particular, of a powerful workers’ committee. A stimulus for further change came in 1994, a landmark year for China’s corporate landscape, when the country’s new Company Law introduced limited-liability companies (LLCs) with the aims of encouraging greater investment, aligning China’s corporate governance with international standards, and facilitating an accelerated transition to a market economy. Ren was intrigued but not immediately convinced, electing to hire a team of Beijing business professors to help him strategize restructuring opportunities and map out a new future for the firm. Huawei did become an LLC (and remains one today), but only in 1997, at which point the existing employee shareholdings, of which there were a large number, were consolidated into a single “trade union” holding. Meanwhile, the professors’ much-anticipated blueprint, the “Huawei Basic Law,” was adopted the following year. Profit would be just one objective among many; more important was the reinvestment of that profit to drive growth—fully 10 percent of sales were to go into R&D. Dou argues that Huawei is ultimately best understood as a company made in the image of the nation. Its goal is not to increase shareholder value so much as “to ensure its own long-term survival,” as is also true, she points out, of the ruling Communist Party. The secret of Huawei’s success, Dou writes, is its “ability to accomplish titanic tasks at almost impossible speeds by getting everyone to pull in unison.” Reading these words, one can’t help but think, yet again, of China’s titanic ongoing achievements in rolling out renewable energy capacity on a gargantuan scale and at almost impossible speeds. But Dou is also forthright about the considerable downsides of this business approach. Success achieved in the manner of Huawei, she observes, “can come at crushing costs for the individuals involved.” Huawei “fetishized long work hours”—the company’s engineers were accustomed to keeping mats by their desks so they could nap on the floor rather than going home at night. Perhaps worse was that an aggressive, survival-of-the-fittest “wolf culture” was encouraged not just externally, in the rivalry with competitors, but internally, among colleagues. And it surely did not help employees’ mental health to know that the prospect of involuntary redundancy constantly hovered in the background: Huawei, Dou notes, “repeatedly pressured its staff into mass resignations.” In any case, enough is known about the psychological effects to leave the reader in no doubt about the sheer corrosiveness of the Huawei model from a social perspective. Dou reports a “string of ‘unnatural’ deaths,” including suicides, among employees. She also cites the finding of a scholarly study that some two-thirds of Huawei’s senior management were suffering from a stress-related illness. Such figures hint at a milieu beside which even Wall Street’s famously pitiless working culture would likely look positively tranquil. Huawei is a creature of Shenzhen, a city in the coastal province of Guangdong in South China. After the decommissioning of his military unit, the Engineering Corps, a thirtysomething Ren Zhengfei moved to Shenzhen in the early 1980s, initially assigned a job there at a subsidiary of the state-owned South Sea Oil Corporation, which was building a harbor to support offshore oil production. Following a “short and undistinguished” time in this position, Ren—who had made something of a name for himself in the military by building a precision air-pressure generator that he subsequently worked to commercialize—established Huawei. He was 42. He is still the company’s CEO today. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that Huawei could not have become what it did except in Shenzhen. Abutting Hong Kong to its immediate south, Shenzhen was designated as China’s first-ever “special economic zone” in 1980. At the time, it had a population of around 30,000. Physically walled off from the rest of China by barbed-wire fences, it was also walled off figuratively: While the post-Mao reformism of Deng Xiaoping initially proceeded slowly in the country at large, everything was on fast forward in the “wild west” that was late-20th-century Shenzhen, where the normal rules did not apply and an “anything goes” approach prevailed. The city was “ground zero,” Dou writes, for China’s “grand experiment with capitalism.” Ren and Huawei exploited this business environment maximally, as did many others. In the 1980s through the 2010s, Shenzhen was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world: By 2020, its 30,000 inhabitants had become 17.4 million, making the city by then China’s third-largest. Of course, the Chinese “capitalism” with which Ren and others experimented in booming Shenzhen was and is a very special version, and Dou does a wonderful job of picturing its sheer foreignness and oddness, when seen through Western eyes. In no respect, perhaps, is the foreignness of Chinese capitalism more striking than in terms of the relation between firms and the Chinese Communist Party. All companies with a certain proportion of employees who are party members are required to establish an internal party “committee” that gives the CCP a formal role in the company. Huawei set up its committee in 1996, with Ren himself serving as the first secretary. Huawei’s committee infused the company with the CCP’s signature themes of “patriotism, struggle for the greater cause, and self-sacrifice”—no doubt the mats by the engineers’ desks and the surging mental health problems were justified accordingly—and its influence appears only to have grown with time. In 2007, the committee was granted veto power over Huawei’s executive appointments. Indeed, as Western observers have never tired of remarking, Huawei’s fortunes were bound up with the party, and with the state more generally, from the start. The mistake that those observers have made, however, is to think about the Chinese state primarily, and sometimes only, in terms of Beijing, which is to say the central government. To do so, Dou shows us, is to miss one of the most important parts of the Huawei story. The specific products that were key to making Huawei a major commercial force both nationally and internationally were digital telephone switches. Able to route and connect thousands (or even millions) of calls at once compared with the mere dozens handled by analog versions, digital switches constitute the nerve centers of modern public communications networks, directing and managing the flow of data as well as voice packets. When Huawei began working in the early 1990s on the development of digital switches, that work was financed by a joint-venture company called Mobeco, established in 1993. The money behind Mobeco was provided by Huawei’s equity partners in the venture—namely, 17 provincial and municipal (that is, public) telecom bureaus. When Huawei’s first proprietary digital switch (C&C08) went into production in 1995, the same public telecom bureaus that had helped finance its development were now in charge of buying it for their local telephone exchanges. Not only that, but, indirectly at least, they also found themselves manufacturing it: Huawei outsourced the production of C&C08 to Mobeco. In short, what Western observers might understand as conflicts of interest abounded. And Huawei then doubled down, as the success of Mobeco prompted it to expand the model: It set up more such joint ventures with local governments around the country. Dou characterizes these as “Huawei’s ‘marriage’ to the state.” This is not to say that Huawei didn’t have close and efficacious relationships with other arms of the state—for example, “in 2005,” Dou writes, “the China Development Bank, a Beijing-controlled policy bank, allocated a whopping $10 billion to fund Huawei’s overseas expansion.” Despite documenting these various linkages between the company and the state, this is also, paradoxically, where House of Huawei is at its weakest. As Dou observes, amid the 1990s ferment of productive innovation in China, Huawei was one of four major domestic producers of telecom equipment to come to the fore, the others being Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE. Why, out of these four, did Huawei emerge as the undisputed leader both domestically and, ultimately, internationally? Dou doesn’t—and arguably can’t—answer that question, because despite hinting that Huawei won simply by virtue of outcompeting its rivals, she never actually gets at the question of what “competition” means in the context of Chinese capitalism, saturated as that system is in political influence. Scholars, however, have been exploring this question. The sociologist Kyle Chan, for instance, has examined the nature of competition in sectors of the Chinese economy in which state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role. His research is highly relevant to the case at hand: Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE are all owned wholly or mainly by the state. Chan found that industries with a substantial SOE presence, telecommunications included, are characterized by what he calls “managed competition,” representing a blend of state oversight and competitive forces and combining innovation and efficiency, on the one hand, with control and planning on the other. In order to maintain a balance of competitive capabilities among industry actors and thus prevent the formation of monopolies, the state intervenes where necessary, Chan argues, to redistribute resources, personnel, and contracts. There is very little analysis of this kind in House of Huawei. Dou has written a book that is much more interested in personalities, subterfuge, and geopolitics than it is in economics and competitive practice. She helps us understand why Huawei vaulted to the top of US policymakers’ fearful protectionist agenda, but less about how and why it vaulted to the top of the telecommunications industry against both national and international competitors. We are left with much still to understand about Huawei as a particular corporate embodiment of what is, in the Chinese case, a very particular type of capitalist social formation. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: There’s method in King Donald’s ‘madness’ on China

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 8:14:14 PM PDT by cold start Don’t go by the defiant rhetoric, China is hurting and in deep trouble over Trump’s tariffsFor the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson For the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property.

Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’.

If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods.

Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

April 21, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: July 24, 2024 – February 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification.

The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability.

Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices.

This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs.

Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations.

But here’s the good news—Lipozem’s triple-action BHB formula is flipping the script. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing! This isn’t about gimmicks or overnight magic. It’s about real science meeting real life. With ingredients that support gut health, ignite your metabolism, and keep you energized all day, Lipozem is helping thousands break through plateaus and feel like themselves again.

Let’s dive in and see if it really lives up to the hype. If you’ve been looking into Lipozem reviews, you’ve likely come across a range of opinions—some users praising the results, others sharing their concerns. That’s exactly why we took a deeper dive. We analyzed verified customer experiences, real-world testimonials, clinical research, and even the small print to give you the full picture. Whether you’re curious about the benefits, potential drawbacks, or the science behind this Triple-BHB fat burner, we’ve broken it all down for you—honestly, clearly, and without the fluff. In this deep dive, we’ll cover: In this guide, you’ll get the full story—the wins, the complaints, the science, and the truth. Because if you’re spending your hard-earned money on a fat burner, you deserve to know exactly what you’re getting. Let’s find out if Lipozem is your next wellness win… or a lesson learned the hard way. The Biology Behind Weight Loss Plateaus Ever feel like your body hits the brakes on fat burning—right when you’re finally making progress? That’s not just bad luck. It’s biology. When you first start losing weight, your body burns through stored fat fast. But soon, it starts to adapt. Your metabolism slows down. Hormones shift. Your body thinks it’s in danger of losing too much, too fast—so it holds on to fat. This is called a weight loss plateau, and it’s totally normal. But here’s the good news: with the right support (like natural fat-burners, better gut health, and inflammation control), you can restart your fat-burning engine. That’s where smarter solutions like Lipozem come in—designed to help your body unlock stubborn fat and keep moving forward. Is Modern Life Making Us Fatter? The Real 2025 Weight Gain Story Let’s be honest—losing weight in 2025 feels harder than ever. Despite calorie counting, gym memberships, and trendy diets, millions still struggle with stubborn fat that refuses to budge. So, what’s going on? Experts now point to our modern lifestyle as the silent culprit. Ultra-processed food, chronic stress, poor sleep, and non-stop screen time all create the perfect storm. These daily habits quietly inflame our fat cells, slow down metabolism, and trigger hormone chaos—causing our bodies to cling to every pound. In this eye-opening breakdown, we’ll explore how today’s world is working against our waistlines—and why inflammation is the missing link behind stalled progress. Plus, we’ll reveal how smart solutions like Lipozem are shifting the game by targeting the root cause, not just the symptoms. What Is Lipozem — and Can It Actually Help You Lose Weight? Tired of trying every fad diet, pill, or workout routine only to see minimal results? You’re not alone. In 2025, weight loss has become more challenging than ever, with stress, hormonal imbalances, and poor lifestyle habits working against us at every turn. Many people find themselves stuck in a frustrating cycle where nothing seems to work. Enter Lipozem—the breakthrough Triple-BHB fat burner that’s making waves in the world of weight loss supplements. Unlike the typical fat burners that rely on harsh stimulants and short-term fixes, Lipozem focuses on a much deeper issue: inflammation in your fat cells. When fat cells become inflamed, they’re “locked,” making it incredibly hard for your body to burn stored fat, no matter how much you exercise or cut calories. That’s where Lipozem comes in. It’s designed to target this inflammation, allowing your body to start burning fat more efficiently while also offering increased energy, reduced cravings, and improved digestion. But the big question remains: Does it really work? With a growing number of people turning to Lipozem for help with their weight loss journeys, it’s time to take a closer look at what this supplement claims to do—and whether it lives up to the hype. In this post, we’ll dive into Lipozem’s ingredients, how it targets fat loss at a cellular level, and whether the product really delivers on its promises.

The Science Behind the Supplement: Lipozem’s Core Ingredients That Target Stubborn Fat When it comes to weight loss, it's not just about what you cut out, but what you put in. Lipozem’s formula is designed to optimize fat loss and overall well-being by focusing on inflammation and metabolic health—and the ingredients back up its claims. Let’s dive into the core ingredients that make this supplement stand out in 2025. Triple-BHB Blend (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) What It Does:BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is the MVP of Lipozem’s formula, but this isn’t just a single compound. It’s a Triple-BHB blend, meaning you get three different forms of BHB (Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) to support fat burning in multiple ways. Turmeric Extract (Curcumin) What It Does:Turmeric is not only a kitchen staple but a powerhouse for reducing inflammation in the body. Specifically, it contains curcumin, which has been shown in studies to combat chronic inflammation, a key contributor to stubborn weight. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) What It Does:Apple cider vinegar is a beloved ingredient in natural wellness, and for good reason. It’s included in Lipozem for its fat-burning, blood sugar-regulating, and digestive-supporting properties. Garcinia Cambogia (Hydroxycitric Acid - HCA) What It Does:Known for its potent HCA (Hydroxycitric Acid), Garcinia Cambogia has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s included in Lipozem for its ability to support appetite control and mood regulation. Green Tea Extract (EGCG) What It Does:Green tea extract is packed with antioxidants, specifically catechins like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which are known for their metabolism-boosting properties. MCT Oil (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) What It Does:Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a special type of fat that is metabolized quickly by the body, providing a quick energy source without being stored as fat. Bioperine (Black Pepper Extract) What It Does:Bioperine is a potent bioavailability enhancer that increases the absorption of all the ingredients in Lipozem, making them more effective. Lipozem's Synergy: How All Ingredients Work Together Lipozem doesn’t just throw a bunch of ingredients together and hope for the best. It’s the synergy of the Triple-BHB, Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Garcinia Cambogia, and others that create a powerful, multi-pathway solution for burning fat. By targeting inflammation, metabolic function, and fat storage, Lipozem works to ignite your body’s natural fat-burning capabilities—without harsh stimulants or extreme dieting. In summary, Lipozem’s ingredients are more than just popular buzzwords—they’re scientifically-backed components that work together to create a system that targets fat from the inside out, boosts your metabolism, and helps you finally get over those weight loss plateaus. The Truth Behind the Triple-BHB Formula Lipozem’s fat-burning engine finally decoded By now, you’ve probably seen the term Triple-BHB all over Lipozem reviews and wondered—what’s the big deal? Is it just another buzzword? Spoiler: nope. It’s the real metabolic magic behind Lipozem’s 2025 weight loss momentum. Let’s break it down without the science snooze-fest: BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is a ketone your body produces when it's burning fat for fuel. But here’s the kicker—Lipozem doesn’t just give you one type of BHB… it delivers a triple hit. That’s sodium BHB, magnesium BHB, and calcium BHB working in perfect harmony to supercharge fat loss and help unlock the stubborn stuff (yes, even belly fat). What Makes Triple-BHB in Lipozem a Game-Changer? According to Dr. Julian Ross, the formulator behind Lipozem, this Triple-BHB blend isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about restoring balance in bodies overwhelmed by inflammation, stress, and sugar crashes. It’s inflammation-first, fat-burning second, and stimulant-free always. So, is Lipozem legit? If you’re chasing real change without extreme dieting, this clinically inspired formula might be the smart move your metabolism has been waiting for. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing! Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem reboots metabolism at its core Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem is flipping the script on fat loss by rebooting metabolism at its core. Unlike typical weight loss pills that rely on harsh stimulants or one-size-fits-all formulas, Lipozem uses a smart, science-backed approach rooted in inflammation control and digestive health. The key players? A Triple-BHB ketone blend for clean energy and fat-burning support, plus powerhouse ingredients like turmeric curcumin and spirulina that help calm inflamed fat cells and restore metabolic function.

Just a clean, targeted formula focused on healing from within—because true weight loss starts in the gut. The Clinical Evidence: What the Research Shows While many supplements rely on animal studies or theoretical benefits, Lipozem stands out with solid clinical trials conducted on humans. Most of the research was performed in Italy, with the key study being a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving 248 participants with confirmed gut dysbiosis. The results, published in the Journal of Digestive Health Research, were nothing short of impressive: "What stands out in this study is that the benefits go far beyond just digestive health," says an expert in integrative gastroenterology. "We saw positive shifts in inflammatory markers, metabolism, and even mental health metrics." In another notable study conducted by experts at Johns Hopkins University, Lipozem was tested in a 16-week trial with 186 weight-loss-resistant subjects. Those who took Lipozem lost an average of 28.7 pounds, compared to just 5.2 pounds in the placebo group—all without altering their diet or exercise routines. Experts explain the weight loss mechanisms as follows: “It appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including better nutrient absorption, reduced inflammation, improved metabolic function, and the restoration of gut bacteria that play key roles in regulating appetite and fat storage. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

As with any weight loss supplement, some customers have expressed dissatisfaction. But what’s really behind the negative feedback? Common Complaints About Lipozem: Why the Complaints Matter Lipozem's formula focuses on addressing the root causes of weight loss struggles, such as inflammation and metabolic blockages, rather than just promoting quick, temporary fixes.

This product is ideal for those looking to address both weight loss and digestive health in one solution. Why Choose Lipozem?

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is Lipozem safe to take every day?Yes—absolutely. Lipozem is made with clean, well-researched ingredients like BHB salts, turmeric curcumin, and spirulina, all of which are considered safe when taken as directed. It contains no synthetic stimulants, no sketchy chemicals, and no hidden fillers. That said, if you're pregnant, nursing, or managing any serious health conditions, it's always smart to talk to your healthcare provider before adding any supplement to your daily routine. How soon will I see results with Lipozem?Everyone’s timeline is a bit different, but many users report subtle shifts within the first 1–2 weeks—like fewer cravings, more steady energy, or feeling less bloated. Visible fat loss tends to show up around weeks 3–4 and can continue improving over 8–12 weeks with consistent use. Because Lipozem focuses on reducing inflammation first (not just water weight), the results are more sustainable—but you’ll need a little patience. Does Lipozem have caffeine or cause jitters?Nope! Lipozem is 100% stimulant-free. That means no caffeine, no energy spikes, and definitely no crash later. Instead, it uses exogenous BHB ketones and anti-inflammatory botanicals to give you that calm, steady energy without the “wired” feeling so common in thermogenic fat burners. Can I take it with other supplements or meds?In most cases, yes. Lipozem plays well with others—but if you’re taking prescription medications (especially for blood sugar, thyroid, or hormones), it’s wise to consult your doctor. Since the formula influences metabolism and inflammation, it’s best to be cautious if you have underlying conditions. What if I forget to take it one day?No big deal—just pick back up with your next dose. While Lipozem works best when used daily, you don’t need to panic if you miss a serving. Just try to stay consistent over time for the best results. Is Lipozem for both men and women?Definitely. Weight gain related to inflammation doesn’t discriminate. Whether it’s stubborn belly fat in men or hormonal weight struggles in women, Lipozem’s multi-action formula is designed to support both sexes equally—helping restore fat-burning from the inside out. Do I need to follow a strict diet or workout program with it?No strict rules here. Lipozem doesn’t demand keto, low-carb, or intense exercise to “work.” That said, pairing it with a balanced diet and light movement can amplify your results. The bonus? Once inflammation drops and cravings calm down, many users naturally eat healthier without forcing it. Where should I buy Lipozem to make sure it’s real?Only buy from the official Lipozem website. It’s not available in stores or on Amazon, and that’s intentional. Ordering directly means you’re getting the genuine product, eligible for the 180-day money-back guarantee, and protected from knockoffs or expired supplements. Final Verdict: Is Lipozem Worth It in 2025? Let’s Get Real. Okay, let’s cut through the fluff. If you’ve been bouncing between trendy detox teas, metabolism “boosters,” and overpriced diet apps that barely deliver, you’re not alone. The weight loss industry is overflowing with gimmicks—and honestly, most of us are over it. Enter Lipozem—the inflammation-fighting, Triple-BHB-powered supplement that’s actually getting attention for the right reasons. It’s not promising overnight abs or asking you to live on lettuce. Instead, it’s designed to address what real science is now calling the root of stubborn fat: inflamed, locked fat cells that refuse to budge, no matter how many salads or spin classes you throw at them. The buzz? Verified reviews from 2025 say Lipozem is helping users reclaim their metabolism, fight bloat, boost energy, and finally break past those frustrating plateaus—all without the sketchy side effects of stimulant-packed formulas. And the best part? It’s only available through the official Lipozem website, so you're guaranteed freshness, authenticity, and full access to support and refunds. So, is Lipozem worth it?If you're tired of quick fixes and want something that works with your body—not against it—then yes. 100%. Lipozem is a smart, modern solution for real, sustainable weight management. Ready to reset your metabolism and finally feel good in your body again? Lipozem might just be your new secret weapon. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Title: Coca-Cola Should 'Continue to Outperform' Amid Tariff Uncertainty, JPM Says

Coca-Cola (KO) is well-positioned amid continuing uncertainty in the market over the Trump administration's tariffs, JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. The analysts lifted their price target to $78 from $74 previously, keeping their "overweight" rating in a note previewing the soda maker's first-quarter results, which are set to be released on April 29. The new price target brings JPMorgan analysts closer to the analyst consensus of $78.58 compiled by Visible Alpha, as they are among 11 other analysts with a "buy" rating, while just one has a "hold" rating on the stock. "While KO is not immune to tariffs and macro headwinds, it is a relatively more defensive stock that will likely deliver among the highest [organic sales growth] in our coverage universe in 2025," the JPMorgan analysts wrote. They lowered their estimates for Coca-Cola's first-quarter and full-year earnings and sales growth due to a "moderating consumption environment in the U.S.," which they expect to be partially offset by a softening dollar. The company has relatively limited exposure risk to tariffs, as the analysts said Coca-Cola's largest risks are likely imported fruit juice and aluminum. They said Coca-Cola's management "doesn't see a potential impact" from possible aluminum inflation that could "derail its outlook." Noting the consumer staple market will be "highly dependent on the macro and tariff situation," the analysts said that "if the current environment continues, we believe KO will continue to outperform peers and the broader market.” Coca-Cola shares were down less than 1% to $72.77 at Monday's close amid a broader market sell-off. They have gained 16% since the start of the year.

My eating habits were erratic — sometimes skipping meals, other times stress-eating at night. By the time I turned 42, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. I tried keto, intermittent fasting, even joined a gym, but nothing stuck — and the bloating was awful.” “A friend introduced me to Slim Jaro and the Pink Salt Trick. I was intrigued because I’d never heard of pink salt being used for fat-burning. I started with the 3-bottle pack. Within the first week, I noticed my late-night cravings had vanished. That alone was a huge win!” “By week 3, my energy levels improved. I didn’t need my usual 3 cups of coffee to stay awake. The scale started moving — slowly but surely. I lost 9 lbs in the first month without any intense workout — just walking and drinking more water.” “Fast forward to 3 months, and I had dropped 28 lbs. My jeans fit again. My confidence returned. My digestion improved. For the first time in years, I looked forward to being in front of the camera.” Biggest Win: Reduced bloating, better sleep, and a new wardrobe.Advice to Others: “Consistency is key. Take it daily and trust the process.” 2.

Sitting for 8-10 hours daily and ordering fast food was my norm. I hit my heaviest at 210 lbs. My energy was tanking, and I felt sluggish by midday. I didn’t have time for long gym sessions or prepping meals. That’s when I looked into natural fat burners and discovered SlimJaro.” “The science behind the ‘Pink Salt Trick’ intrigued me — especially how it activates thermogenesis and supports hormone balance. I was skeptical but hopeful. I went for the 3-month bundle, and I’m glad I did.” “Week 1: I had more energy. No jitters, just clean focus.Week 2: I noticed my belly was less bloated.Week 4: I lost 11 lbs. I couldn’t believe it.” “The appetite control was a game-changer. I stopped snacking mindlessly.

But the progress was slow and draining.” “One day, I saw a before-and-after of a mom using Slim Jaro. I immediately researched it.

Let’s explore how SlimJaro tailors’ benefits across genders: For Women: Supporting Hormonal Harmony and Fat Burn Women often face weight-related challenges due to hormonal fluctuations caused by pregnancy, PCOS, menopause, or thyroid issues. These hormonal changes can result in increased appetite, slow metabolism, and fat retention—especially around the hips, belly, and thighs. SlimJaro helps regulate female-specific hormones like oestrogen and leptin, supporting: Many women experience an increased sense of self-control around food, less bloating, and a leaner midsection within weeks of starting SlimJaro. For Men: Muscle Retention and Belly Fat Reduction Men typically store fat in the abdominal region and often experience reduced testosterone and slowed metabolism as they age. SlimJaro supports metabolic restoration and natural hormone production that helps men: Men often report noticeable waist reduction, improved athletic performance, and more energy to stay active after starting Slim Jaro. Unisex Performance: One Formula, Universal Results SlimJaro’s formula is not gender-biased. It is suitable for everyone aged 18+, regardless of gender identity, provided they are not pregnant or nursing. Its natural, inclusive formulation makes it ideal for couples trying to get healthier together. The Origin of SlimJaro: From Research to Real Results The story of Slim Jaro starts not in a marketing boardroom but in a clinical wellness research lab where scientists and nutritionists focused on the root causes of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Through years of trials and testing, they identified a critical issue shared by most overweight individuals: a sluggish metabolism and poor fat oxidation. What fascinated the creators of SlimJaro was a discovery based on mineral activation and hormonal stimulation using trace elements found in Himalayan pink salt. This finding was coined the “Pink Salt Trick” – a powerful method of supporting metabolic efficiency and controlling hunger through a natural mechanism. But rather than making people rely on pink salt alone, the team incorporated this trick into a holistic supplement that combines modern nutrition with ancient wisdom. Thus, Slim Jaro was born – a capsule-based product that’s easy to use, gentle on the system, and powerful enough to accelerate fat burn naturally. The product’s creators wanted SlimJaro to break boundaries – not just in terms of scientific innovation, but also in accessibility. That’s why Slim Jaro was formulated to suit people of all dietary backgrounds. It’s non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and free from harsh chemicals or stimulants. Since its launch, SlimJaro has exploded in popularity due to word-of-mouth success stories. Users from diverse backgrounds began to see visible results within weeks, driving a surge in global demand. What began as a niche wellness innovation is now a multinational best-seller, with a loyal customer base in over 25 countries. In many ways, SlimJaro is more than just a product – it’s a movement, reshaping how people view weight loss. It doesn’t push starvation diets or endless hours at the gym. Instead, it offers real results through metabolic support, hormonal balance, and appetite control – all rooted in natural ingredients. How Slim Jaro Works: The Science Behind the Magic? At its core, SlimJaro addresses the three main barriers to weight loss: Each capsule of SlimJaro is infused with ingredients that trigger a chain reaction in the body, beginning with metabolic activation. The Pink Salt Trick acts as the ignition, helping to stimulate thermogenesis – the process by which your body burns calories to produce heat. Once thermogenesis is activated, the ingredients in Slim Jaro mobilize stored fat, converting it into usable energy. This not only reduces fat storage but also boosts vitality, so you feel more active, alert, and motivated throughout the day. SlimJaro also plays a role in balancing key weight-related hormones, particularly leptin and ghrelin. Leptin controls satiety (the feeling of fullness), while ghrelin triggers hunger. When these hormones are out of balance, it leads to overeating and emotional cravings. SlimJaro helps stabilize this hormonal interplay, which leads to better control over portion sizes and reduced emotional eating. In addition, the supplement contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that improve digestion and reduce bloating. Many users report feeling lighter, less bloated, and more regular within days of starting Slim Jaro. Importantly, SlimJaro works with your body – not against it. There are no jittery side effects like those found in caffeine-heavy fat burners. Instead, it promotes steady, sustainable fat loss by enhancing your body’s natural ability to process fat and use it as fuel. SlimJaro Ingredients Breakdown: What’s Inside the Formula? Slim Jaro isn't just another trendy fat burner—it’s a scientifically crafted metabolic support formula based on natural, clinically reviewed ingredients that target fat burning, appetite control, hormonal balance, and energy enhancement. Let’s explore each key ingredient in Slim Jaro, understand its function, and how it contributes to healthy and sustainable weight loss.

Slim Jaro’s Global Impact: Weight Loss Without Borders In today’s interconnected world, the desire to lead a healthier, more energetic life knows no boundaries. But for years, the weight loss industry was dominated by regional trends, culturally biased fitness routines, and one-size-fits-all solutions that didn’t cater to diverse needs. Enter Slim Jaro—a revolutionary natural formula that has quickly evolved from a trending supplement to a global phenomenon, proving that effective weight loss isn’t confined to geography, culture, or background. From the bustling streets of New York to the serene yoga retreats of Bali, the deserts of the Middle East to the vineyards of France, SlimJaro is changing lives—one bottle at a time.

In wellness-forward cities like Los Angeles and Austin, influencers began calling it the “Pink Salt Trick” and shared their transformations online. It wasn’t long before the product went viral.

Slim Jaro Benefits Explained: How It Transforms Your Body from the Inside Out Slim Jaro is more than a weight loss pill — it’s a holistic health enhancer designed to activate your body’s natural fat-burning systems, restore metabolic balance, suppress unhealthy cravings, and elevate daily energy levels. Let’s take a deep dive into the core benefits of SlimJaro, exploring how each one works, what makes it effective, and why it has become a global favorite for men and women seeking safe, natural transformation. 1. Accelerates Fat Burning Through Thermogenesis How It Works: Slim Jaro contains thermogenic agents like Green Tea Extract (EGCG), Cayenne Pepper (Capsaicin), and Black Pepper Extract (Piperine) that increase your core body temperature. This process, known as thermogenesis, forces your body to burn more calories—even when at rest. The Result: You experience faster calorie burning, even while sitting or doing light activities. Over time, this contributes to a significant reduction in stored body fat, particularly in the midsection. 2. Reduces Appetite and Controls Cravings How It Works: SlimJaro targets the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for hunger, using natural appetite-suppressing ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia, Apple Cider Vinegar, and African Mango Extract. The Result: You naturally eat less without feeling deprived. This leads to a calorie deficit, the key to consistent weight loss. 3. Balances Hormones That Influence Weight Gain How It Works: SlimJaro addresses hormonal imbalances that are often the hidden culprits behind stubborn fat—especially belly and hip fat. Ingredients like Ashwagandha and Pink Himalayan Salt support adrenal function and hormonal harmony. The Result: By correcting hormonal disruptions, Slim Jaro helps the body return to a fat-burning state, making it easier to lose weight even after plateaus or menopause. 4. Boosts Energy Without Caffeine or Jitters How It Works: Unlike stimulant-based fat burners that cause energy crashes, SlimJaro uses a clean energy formula derived from metabolic enhancers like Green Tea Extract, Cayenne Pepper, and Chromium Picolinate. The Result: You feel awake, focused, and ready to move, without the highs and crashes of sugar or coffee. This energy boost also encourages physical activity, further enhancing weight loss. [Trusted by Thousands Worldwide] - Read SlimJaro Reviews & Real Customer Complaints! 5. Supports Healthy Digestion and Reduces Bloating How It Works: A sluggish digestive system can slow metabolism and promote bloating. Slim Jaro includes ingredients like Apple Cider Vinegar, Pink Himalayan Salt, and Piperine to improve digestive enzyme function. The Result: Better digestion = less bloating, smoother metabolism, and faster nutrient absorption, all of which contribute to a flatter stomach and enhanced fat-burning. 6. Improves Sleep and Reduces Stress-Eating How It Works: Emotional and late-night eating are often driven by high cortisol and poor sleep. SlimJaro addresses both with Ashwagandha, an adaptogen known to calm the nervous system and regulate stress hormones. The Result: You wake up refreshed and less prone to stress-based snacking, which can make or break a fat-loss journey. 7. Supports Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health How It Works: SlimJaro supports healthy heart function and metabolic performance by improving lipid profiles, reducing inflammation, and enhancing blood flow through ingredients like Garcinia, ACV, and Green Tea. The Result: Not only do you look better, but your heart, arteries, and metabolic system function better too, supporting long-term wellness. 8. Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Blood Sugar Control How It Works: Fat loss becomes difficult when insulin resistance is high. SlimJaro fights this with Chromium Picolinate, ACV, and African Mango, all of which help stabilize blood sugar and improve insulin response. The Result: You experience fewer sugar crashes, more stable energy, and a reduction in fat storage, especially around the waist. 9. Enhances Nutrient Absorption for Better Results How It Works: Even the best supplement won’t work if your body can’t absorb it. SlimJaro includes Piperine, which amplifies the bioavailability of other ingredients by as much as 2000%. The Result: You get the full benefits of every capsule, making Slim Jaro more effective than standalone extracts. 10. Works for All Body Types and Lifestyles How It Works: SlimJaro was created with universal metabolic triggers that don’t rely on gender, specific diets, or age groups. Whether you’re on keto, vegan, intermittent fasting, or no diet at all, the formula adapts to your biology. The Result: It becomes a sustainable daily supplement, not a short-term gimmick. Users across the world—ages 18 to 70+—have reported significant benefits. 11. Safe, Natural, and Non-GMO How It Works: Every capsule of SlimJaro is made in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities with third-party testing to ensure safety and potency. The ingredients are free from synthetic binders, preservatives, or toxic fillers. The Result: A clean formula you can take daily without fear of long-term health risks or side effects. 12. Backed by a 180-Day Money-Back Guarantee While not a biological benefit, this policy ensures peace of mind, allowing users to try SlimJaro risk-free. It also reflects the company’s confidence in the product’s effectiveness.

Apple and Amazon have lost $1 trillion combined since the president’s “liberation day” tariff plan was announced earlier this month Wall Street is off to a brutal start to the week, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 3% a few hours into trading on Monday morning, as the markets continue to grapple with President Trump’s tariffs and his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.29%, the S&P 500 was down 2.97%, and the Dow Jones had dropped 2.84% by 12:15 E.T. on Monday. Several major media and tech companies like Apple and Disney have taken hits to their share price as part of the downturn — more on that in a minute — and from a macro standpoint, all three major indexes are down 10% or more since the president announced his “liberation day” tariff plan on Apr. 2. Since then, the markets have been compared innumerable times to riding a rollercoaster, with wild daily swings becoming the norm the past few weeks. The Trump Administration on Friday signaled it was getting closer to working out a trade deal with China, although nothing concrete has been announced. The markets appear to have wanted a bit more clarity by the time trading started on Monday, especially as earnings season has kicked off. Last week, Netflix reported sales of $10.5 billion in the first quarter — up 12% year-over-year. Netflix’s stock is up 2.15% on Monday to $994 per share. A number of other big tech and media companies, including Meta, Spotify, Comcast and Disney, are set to report their first quarter earnings over the next few weeks. Something else that likely did not boost investor confidence on Monday was the president slamming Powell as a “major loser” who should cut interest rates. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is down 3.05% on Monday. Since Apr. 2, the tech giant has seen $700 billion shaved from its market cap, as investors have worried about the tariff on Chinese imports hitting Apple devices. Amazon is down 3.49% on Monday and has had its valuation drop from $2.07 trillion to $177 trillion since the start of April. And Google, which was found to have an illegal monopoly for the second time in less than a year last week, was down 2.88% a few hours into trading. Meta, meanwhile, is down 3.68%; The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is currently facing its own antitrust lawsuit from the government. Here is how a number of other media and tech stocks are performing: Comcast: -1.82% Roku: -0.74% Amazon: -3.49% Disney: -1.52% WB Discovery: -3.80% Snap Inc.: -2.84% Paramount: -0.87% Spotify: -1.80% Live Nation: -2.80% As for earnings, check TheWrap on Thursday morning for a look at how Comcast’s Q1 went, then check back on Thursday afternoon for a look at how Alphabet, Google and YouTube’s parent company, performed.

(Photo by Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The headlines are full of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU madness, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) China risk, and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) margin implosion - but while the rest of the Mag 7 dance on a tightrope, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is quietly setting up for what could be a 20–25% upside, putting a $500 price tag within reach. As an aside, do deficits matter? See: The U.S. Trade Deficit Math In Four Lines. You don’t need hype when you have compounding cash flows, irreplaceable products, and a balance sheet strong enough to fund a small country. This isn’t a meme trade - it’s a fortress stock. It’s hard not to have it in your portfolio. And if you do not want to undertake the painstaking and meticulous process of identifying the right portfolio mix, consider our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down why smart money could rotate into Microsoft - and fast. Let’s start with this: Microsoft generates $100 Bil+, in fact > $115 Bil , in operating profit annually. So you have a company that’s growing faster than Apple, is cheaper than Nvidia, has better margin than Amazon, and is less volatile than Tesla. Why won’t you have it in your portfolio? Unlike Apple or Nvidia, Microsoft doesn’t ship chips or assemble phones in China. And that matters. In a de-globalizing world, Microsoft’s geopolitical footprint is a superpower. Right now, Nvidia and Meta have stolen the spotlight. But valuations are stretched, and institutional funds know rotation is coming. This is what positioning before the crowd looks like. Microsoft is exciting, isn’t it? But investing in a single stock can be risky no matter what. We diversify away this risk while giving upside exposure in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

As markets swirl amid tariffs and trade war concerns, one company is looking rather recession-proof: Netflix (NFLX). The company was one of the rare bright spots in trading Monday, rising almost 2% after delivering a blockbuster first quarter that had experts comparing the company with Big Tech instead of Big Media. Netflix posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.5 billion in revenue. Netflix is outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices as of midday Monday, which had declines of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively.​ The company is up 12% year-to-date, while the S&P and Nasdaq are down 12.5% and 18%. An analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” The report’s key takeaways included that price hikes are performing in line with expectations and retention is strong and stable; that the advertising business is successfully scaling; and that Netflix’s large, monetizable audience should allow the company to maintain its edge over competitors. “Netflix disclosed its audience is larger than 700 million people, with more than two-thirds of the audience outside the United States,” analysts wrote. “Given its content diversification strategy of making original content for global countries, this should allow the company to maintain its scaled competitive advantage.” Netflix expects its second quarter revenue to be slightly above Wall Street’s expectation at roughly $11 billion. Its 2025 revenue is still expected to be between $43.5 and $44.5 billion. Netflix does have areas where it can improve, however, according to the William Blair analysts. Namely: its advertising product. Earlier this month, the company rolled out its ads suite in the U.S. and will start rolling its product out to other advertising markets. “In our view, this is important because the advertisers we have spoken with suggest Netflix needed to improve its advertising platform. The new platform will provide advertisers with better measurement and targeting, new ad formats, and advanced programmatic capabilities,” the analysts wrote. The company is looking at other ways to expand, too. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in an earnings call Thursday that video podcasts may be the next format to land on the platform, potentially pulling business from Spotify (SPOT) and YouTube (GOOGL). Other analysts shared William Blair’s optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note published Sunday that “Netflix [is] playing offense, while stock remains defensive.” And Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called the company “the cleanest story in internet” following its first quarter results.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns 538,000 Bitcoin worth $47.2 billion following Bitcoin’s climb above $88,000 on Sunday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The software firm said it scooped the asset up for an average price of $84,800 last week. Strategy said the acquisition was made using proceeds from two recent equity offerings: the firm received $548 million in proceeds by issuing Class A common shares, while Strategy also gained $8 million from the sale of its so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has weighed on risk assets in recent weeks, as economists pencil in slower growth and higher costs for consumers in the U.S., yet Strategy has bought Bitcoin fairly consistently since mid-March. Over the past six Mondays, Strategy has said that it bought Bitcoin on five of them. The size of Strategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases has varied, however. After buying $11 million worth of Bitcoin in mid-March, it spent $1.9 billion on Bitcoin two weeks later, per Saylor Tracker. Strategy’s shares were recently trading at about $322, up 1.6% on the day, according to Nasdaq. The stock changed hands as high as $328 during pre-market trading on Monday but plunged as low as $317 after the opening bell. On Sunday, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor noted on X, formerly Twitter, that the company isn’t a niche option for gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price anymore. Based on public data, 13,000 institutions hold Strategy’s stock directly, along with 814,000 accounts tied to retail investors, he said. In addition, Saylor said 55 million investors have “indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios. Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December, a milestone placing it within the coveted ranks of tech giants like Apple and Meta. The company may also join the S&P 500 one day, but Strategy’s lack of consistent profits is currently a barrier, based on inclusion criteria.

Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Verizon consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath, who goes by “Sampath.” As CEO of Verizon’s consumer division, Sampath oversees the biggest part of the business: Verizon Wireless, which has more than 115 million wireless connections, and Fios, which adds another 10 million or so consumer broadband connections to the mix. That’s something like a solid third of the entire country in business with Sampath. As you’ll hear, Sampath is a longtime Verge reader, and in particular he’s been paying attention to my coverage of both 5G and the net neutrality debates for a long time. So we talked very directly about whether the huge 5G investment had actually paid off — whether the “race” we were supposedly in with China was actually worth it, and what kinds of new apps and services actually come to light. You’ll hear Sampath say that network capacity isn’t a small thing, and 5G really helped with the explosion of mobile data — although I was told we’d all be doing robot surgery in driverless cars by now. The mechanics of all that buildout are fascinating to me, regardless of the hype. Building network infrastructure takes years — everything from figuring out what spectrum to bid on to making deals for towers and running fiber to them is a huge process, and I wanted to ask Sampath how he balances all those very long-term, very tactical decisions against the decisions we all see and feel in very obvious ways, like consumer pricing. Sampath had one of the very clearest answers to the classic Decoder question about decision making here — like I said, you can tell he was very ready to be on this show. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Sampath and I also spent a while talking about the push and pull of integrating content and applications directly into the network. That’s something that all the big wireless carriers flirted with in various ways, especially in and around the peak net neutrality debate. In 2018, AT&T bought HBO and CNN parent Time Warner, right after Verizon bought Yahoo and started something called go90. For one brief extremely weird moment there, Verizon even owned Tumblr. The goal of all these media plays was to differentiate the various networks from each other, and it basically didn’t work for anyone — even though Verizon in particular fought the various net neutrality regulations that would have prevented this sideshow in the first place. Sampath and I got pretty far into the weeds on that. You’ll hear him say he thinks no one cares about net neutrality, and, well — I disagreed with him. And while Verizon has always fought tooth and nail against the sort of “normal” regulations like net neutrality, the second Trump administration isn’t nearly as hands-off when it comes to things like holding up deals because of DEI policies — something that’s happening to Verizon right now. So I had to ask Sampath if he was going to push back on that kind of clear government overreach as hard as Verizon has pushed back in the past. This one is all kinds of wonky, because it’s two telecom nerds going at it, so some notes before we start. You’re going to hear me talk about local loop unbundling, which is when multiple internet providers can use the same fiber to reach consumers. We don’t really have it in the United States — there are not four different ISPs all competing to reach your house on the same mile of cable or fiber — but many other countries do, as a way to increase broadband competition. The other thing you’ll hear us get into is something called OpenRAN. That’s an initiative the US government committed some money to last year that’s supposed to open up competition in the broadband hardware space and get US providers off of Huawei components. It’s a little complicated, but it’s a big bet in the mobile industry, and I wanted to hear Sampath’s take on it. Okay: Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, you’re the CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. Welcome to Decoder. Good to see you, Nilay. I am very excited to talk to you. It’s a topsy-turvy time in America, but telco stocks are doing great. Everyone needs internet service, and there’s a really interesting dynamic there that I want to explore with you. But first, we don’t get a lot of telecom CEOs on the show. It’s hard to understand how telecom companies are structured. I want to start with the Decoder question because all of these companies have been built by mergers, spinoffs, sales, and recombinations. You were the CEO of Verizon’s business unit. Now you’re the CEO of the consumer group. Explain how all of this is structured and what the Verizon consumer actually is. The way we think about it is, we are customer-facing. We have a Verizon Business group, which takes care of all businesses — small businesses, government, large enterprises, anything from Walmart down to Joe’s Pizza. We take care of that. Then everyone else is a consumer. It’s you and me in our private lives. The wireless service, the fiber service, the broadband to the home — all that’s in consumer. The consumer business is a little north of $105 billion in revenue. I’m responsible for sales, marketing, product offering, customer care, and digital. It’s an end-to-end unit getting things done. Most telcos, at least Verizon, have a common network that serves all of us. We call it the Intelligent Edge Network. It’s a single network that serves different types of underlying networks and businesses, so we don’t multiply costs in it. That’s it. It’s a pretty simple structure. Go to market for business, go to market for consumer, and a common network that is a shared service that serves all of us. I’ve spent a lot of time covering telecom companies, and in particular, wireless and mobile companies. One thing that always feels opaque to me is the differentiation that you can do to a business or a customer based on the network. This was a big fight in the net neutrality days, that you’d want to differentiate the actual network for different customers in different ways, and that has waned. When you say you go to market for the customer, are you in charge of things like pricing and promotion, or do you actually get to say, “Here’s what the network can and cannot do?” Here’s what the network can and cannot do. It’s the whole end-to-end offering, including the product. The way we think about it is that a product is a network. Look, there will always be a good operator and a non-good operator. It’s historically always been the same. For a country as large as America, you’ll always... Look at the end of the day, we and my peers use the same steel to make the towers. We use common tower companies to take care of our tower business. We use pretty similar vendors. We use Ericsson and Samsung. Some may use Nokia. There’s a commonality there. But the secret sauce is in the operations. When you’re running a network this big, how do you take care of outages? How do you plan for it? And even small things like how you design your tower or the specs you put on your tower? For example, almost all our sites have generator backup. Whenever a hurricane falls or there’s a natural disaster, our sites are up and running because we have backups on our sites. Second, we like resiliency on our sites. There will always be a better operator and not a good operator. We know it. We’ve got 25 years of experience or 30 years, depending on how you count it in the space. There will always be a gap. Now, is the gap narrowing between us and the second network? Probably yes. But there’ll always be a gap, and that’s why people always choose us for the network. If you go and ask people who’s the better network, they’ll always end up saying Verizon. We have to stay on top of it by using more AI in our operations. Self-healing networks. Spectrum is another thing. We have to keep buying a lot of spectrum to put it... There is always a case for a better operator and a better network. I think that’s the heart of my question. Verizon, as a company, in a very reductive way, has to go to the government, lease a bunch of spectrum capacity, and go to a bunch of tower operators. I always think it’s funny that the biggest one is called TowerCo. It’s just a very literal name that no one except you has to consider. You have to go to a bunch of tower companies and site operators, give them the spectrum so they can operate the towers, and lease the capacity back from them to run your network. Your competitors might be on the same infrastructure or the same sites in many cases because it’s so hard to build a cell tower in many places. Then, somehow, at the end of that, the consumer perceives Verizon’s network as the best one. That is as much a function of consumer marketing and experience… When I moved to New York in the early 2010s, everybody had a Blackberry and Verizon, and that impression has stuck with me for all this time. Maybe that’s still the case that Verizon is the best, but what happened was I moved to New York in the 2010s, and Cingular had the best network in Chicago at that time (where I moved from). Then Verizon was the best on the East Coast. I spend a lot of time thinking, “Where does that impression actually come from?” Because no customer holds two phones in their hands and says, “This one has better service.” There are two ways. One is, is it a better network, and then the other is, how do people perceive it? We talk about national networks. We are the largest network because more customers are on us, but the end of the network is a very local thing. The vast majority of our customers, I would say 60 or 70 percent of our customers, never go outside a five-cell cell site travel zone for the year. Think about it, you may have a great network in Alaska, but 70 percent of your customers are not traveling within five or six-cell sites outside their home or their workplace. It’s a very local conversation about how good you are. Of course, there are some people who travel a lot. People like me who are on the road 150 days per year. It’s a different equation. But for most people, how good is the network at home? How good is the network at work? How good is the network during their commute? And that’s what makes the experience. You cannot have national standards to do these things. A lot of it is a local game. Getting access to sites locally. Getting access to better network technology at the local level. Having people who know the network topology at the local level. It’s a very local game, this network thing. And that’s why you see Verizon tends to do well when local networks come into play. How much impact do you have on the capital expenditure of building the network itself? You have a number of customers, and the business side has a number of customers. Do you jointly show up in front of the core network team and say, “You need to build more capacity in Connecticut”? The consumer group has 85 to 90 percent of all the usage on the network. Maybe it’s a slightly stilted conversation there, but the way it works is… Network is a little bit like scotch. It takes a long time to really become good. Decisions we make today on the network tend to show up three, four, five, or seven years later down the line because there’s a huge lead time to it. You’ve got to procure the fiber, backhaul the sites, and the spectrum to do that. The way we start is by asking, “What is the network I need to deliver my customer’s needs?” And it’s at a local level. In Philadelphia, by markets, what do I know? How much share do I have? What am I going to grow? Then we take that back to the network team and say, “Based on what assets you have, what’s available? Can you deliver this?” And 9 out of 10 times, they can deliver it. The one out of 10 times they can’t, then we move our marketing plans... If they don’t have capacity, they’re not going to get capacity in this market in the next few years. The second thing is having objective metrics of network performance. For a common person, if a call drops or a network data session goes down, it’s bad. But we track it a million different ways by design. Having that common nomenclature... Back in the day, it was dropped calls. Thinking, “How many drop calls did you have?” We used to measure every single one of them, and then if a drop call happened, we used to go and do root cause analysis. Now it’s data sessions. How many data sessions do you have? When did it drop? What were the speeds? How did the signal flow? Having really good instrumentation at the local level is really important. We’ve created basically a digital twin for every single customer. Every customer has a digital twin in the network where we measure the network 24/7, and we give them a score. Nilay had a score, it’s out of 10. You can say Nilay had a 9.7 score this morning on his commute from A to B. It’s a good score. If he had a score of five, we would go and understand why the score of five happened. Every single customer is monitored 24/7, from a network performance perspective, and then we track them through the system. When you look at that kind of data at scale, you obviously have lots of customers who, I’m guessing, have lots of different scores across the board. Where’s the median? Where do you want people to be? You want people to be in the eights and nines for the vast part of their lives. Now, one of the things with the network is... A bigger issue we have to face, as an industry, is that when things work well, nobody thinks of us. When things don’t... It’s a little bit like parenting sometimes. When the kids are happy, they don’t think of us. Then, when they’re less than happy, they think of us. It’s a little bit like that, because 90-something percent of the time, the network works flawlessly. Whether we’re discussing the fiber in the home or the wireless network. And we are largely forgotten, which is good. But when it doesn’t work, all the emotions come out in front. We are trying to solve for that one percent where the network doesn’t work, or we’ve disappointed the customer. Most of our work is isolating where it doesn’t work. Because where it works, we know it, and we just have to let the machine run its course. We’ve talked a lot about the mobile network. You also have oversight of Fios, right? The fiber buildout. Verizon has been up and down with Fios over the 15 years that I have covered this company. There are huge investments, huge government-backed investments, disinvestment, and reinvestment. Where are you with Fios now? We love fiber. Some of it is personal. Look, I built my career on fiber. In every role I’ve had at Verizon, we ended up building more fiber. Verizon was the first. In 2004, we created the Fios network. It was the first, probably in the world, to have fiber. We slowed down a bit in the middle; it was mostly a capital allocation issue for us. We always liked the business. We committed to it at an OPEX level, but we had to invest in 4G. We had to buy the spectrum to invest in 4G. Then we had to buy the spectrum for 5G. Some of the capital that we would’ve put into fiber then, we ended up moving to the wireless side of the business. Now that the 5G is towards the back end of its build, we are back in the fiber business. We bought Frontier, and we are going to close before the year’s end, or maybe in the first quarter of 2026. That’ll give us another 10 million homes. Nilay, we’re going to have a path to get to 40 million homes of fiber. And fiber is so resilient. The churn is very low. The customer satisfaction is crazy high. Then, when you put the two together, mobile and home, the economics are fabulous. We are really committed to a converged strategy on fiber plus mobility, and that’s the business we are in. We are not distracted as a company. It’s very simple. People ask me, “What do you do?” I say, “I connect things, I connect people.” Full stop. There’s no other business we want to be in, and fiber is part of that story. Well, I’m on a Fios connection now. So if this drops, it’s on you. Just letting you know. Nilay, it ain’t dropping. I’m on a Fios connection too, and it ain’t dropping. Describe the structure of Verizon broadly. You’ve laid it out in a big way, right? There’s the network, there’s business, and there’s consumer. How many people do you have in consumer, and how is that actually structured inside Verizon? We work with partners, as well as... A lot of our call centers have partners. Some of our stores have partners. We have probably around 30,000-ish people in the consumer unit broadly. I probably end up managing, directly or indirectly, the 30,000 people between our call center partners and our agents to do the work that Verizon consumer is tasked with. The way we are structured internally in Consumer is that we have a gentleman, Frank Boulben, who runs revenue for us. He has all the product offerings. The go-to-market sits with him. Then we have Kevin [Zavaglia], who runs our field. We are the sixth-largest retailer in America. We have 8,000 exclusive stores between our brands. Kevin runs all of that, plus our relationships on the distribution side. Then we have Nancy Clark, who runs our prepaid business. It’s a fully integrated business. We’ve turned around that business really well. We should touch on that at some point. She runs that. Monica Hammond runs all our customer service, customer care, and customer success organization. And Brian Higgins runs customer experience and digital. A very typical structure that we have. I think most telcos end up doing something quite similar to this. Is there any innovation in that structure? We have a lot of startup founders come on the show that have big ideas about structure, and then maybe they land in one of two or three different ones. But then you see some companies show up and say, “Okay, there’s actually efficiency from rethinking the structure.” Telcos are big, regulated companies. Obviously, that shapes how you would run a company like Verizon. But do you see any efficiency there compared to your big competitors like AT&T or T-Mobile? I was a management consultant. I was with a Boston Consulting Group for a very, very long time before this. We had a strong thesis on organization and structure. Then I became a day-to-day operator. I think as long as your structure is not crazy stupid, it works. It all comes down to people and taking friction out of the process. Because any structure will have a seam in it, otherwise the president of the country should be running every single thing on a single day-to-day basis. It doesn’t work. When you break it up into a company, break it up into divisions, you’ll have a seam everywhere. The question is, how do you manage the seam? Because every time you ship a product out, you ship your org structure. We know it. Okay? The question is, where are the seams, and how do you take the friction of those seams out? For example, customer care and digital. One is the digital channel. One is a human being getting called. When you call up, does the lady in customer care know what you did in digital five minutes ago? There’s a seam in the organization. You have to go and manage those seams, not get too bent about who reports to whom and what structure it is. And I think people tend to change structures a lot, hoping they’re going to get magic out of it. But I think the magic is in friction, seam management, and never ever shipping your org structure on your product. Your product should not look like your org. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is about decisions. You have a lot of decisions to make. Everything from going to try to buy spectrum, to customer-facing decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? I have a framework for decision-making. It’s a two-by-two matrix. Of course, any recovering consultant has to tell you that. On the X axis, it’s what I call a one-way decision or a two-way decision. One-way decisions for me are really big and very difficult to unwind. It’s things like buying other companies. Even some big leadership decisions, long-term pricing decisions, and big product categories that you want to be in. These are one-way decisions. The cost to unwind is very high, very painful, and will take a toll on the company and its finances. That’s one. Then I have what I call two-way decisions. It’s a promotion. It’s moving a few people around in the markets. It’s trying different things with retailers, trying different compensation things. These are two-way decisions. They can be reversed. Damage can be limited. You could make a bad decision, but you can limit the damage. Then on the other axis, I have low dollars and high dollars. Low dollar, I have a certain threshold in my head. These are low-dollar decisions. And then you have high-dollar decisions. You never want to spend time with one-way, low-dollar decisions. They’re just bad. You should never even have one of those, but people spend time in companies on that. I work very hard not to make those decisions at all. Because if something is a one-way decision and big enough, it had better have a high impact. If it’s low impact, you shouldn’t do it because there’s risk in it, and it’s not worth it. Anything that is a two-way decision, that is also low-dollar, you should delegate it. Someone else can make the decision, you’ll be fine. And you have to trust the governance model, that there are checks and balances, so nothing bad happens. I try to spend 60 percent of my time on one-way decisions that are high-dollar value. Where to invest? What categories to do? Who are the big leadership positions I want to fill with talent? And I map every decision down to this framework, and I actively manage it. Just moving from a staff role into a large ops role, the best way to understand how a company runs is to follow the decision-making style. How do decisions get made? Who makes them? Who has the pocket vetoes? You can understand every single thing about a group you’ve inherited by just following decisions. Take five decisions, and track them end-to-end. That’s it. That’s all you need to know. You know about people. You know about pocket vetoes. You know who the naysayers are. You know who’s not ambitious, and you know about talent. For me, decision-making is a science and an art, and one that I practice really aggressively every time I can. That was the best answer to the decision-making question we’ve ever gotten, but that’s the thesis of the show, right? Inside the question about structure and decision-making, I can tell you about 80 percent of your company. I know it from the jump, and then we can go on to the actual specifics. But yours is an interesting answer because you’ve devalued the structure question, and you’ve raised the value of the decision question. Most folks do it the other way around. Why make the flip? Because I think organization is a people construct. When people like each other, when they feel like their work is well taken care of and appreciated, and they’re in a well-supported framework, they’ll give it their best. I think people use structure sometimes to pit people against each other and give conflicting priorities to different people, thinking they’re going to get the best answer. I do not believe in that. I strongly believe... I have extra time sometimes. Rare, but I do have extra time. This afternoon from 4PM to 6PM, I don’t have anything on my calendar. I will go back and say, “Where can I take the friction out of the organization?” Because when my role is... The best use of my time is when I take the friction out. For example, there may be friction between two groups. I go sit down with them, “Tell me, why is there friction? Oh, we have an issue with priorities. Let’s go sort it out.” The minute we take the friction out, people work well together. Organization gets devalued completely. Then it all comes back to decision-making. And second is… Organization is always a moment-in-time issue because priorities change, people change, and organizations change. You can’t use an org structure to drive performance in the field and priorities. I like decision-making as a more powerful tool to do that. And the second is, how much data is enough to make a decision? This is something, I think, a lot more material should be written about. I promise I will not write a book on this when I retire. People think there are some groups that think they need 100 percent of the data to make a decision. Some make it on a gut. I don’t think both are right or wrong, but we also need a good framework for that as well. Like, “When are you ready to pull the trigger on things?” It’s difficult in big companies, but it’s also very difficult in startups, and I think it’s a very different construct. Because in my business, I know the market, I know the customer. I have 100 years’ worth of customer experience and customer elasticity models to work with. It’s a very different thing. When in startup mode, you’re creating a category. TAM doesn’t exist. You’re stretching PowerPoint to make your TAM real. You have to rely more on the gut to make those calls. When it comes to people decisions, you can put them through evaluation, but you have to make decisions based on gut [feelings]. But when we’re making a pricing promotion, or product-fit decisions in my world, I think it’s a little more data-driven. That is another area where I think I’ll become a better manager if I practice more of that. Let’s put some of this into practice. Let’s just walk through an easy one here. Verizon just announced a three-year price lock for customers. This is right on top of the Trump tariffs. I always wonder how these decisions get made. A long, long time ago, I asked another network executive, “Why is this pricing like this?” And the answer — this is a real answer that I received from your other big competitor, but a decade ago — was, “Well, this is how the computer system works. To make it different, we would have to reprogram a bunch of billing systems, and that’s costly. This is how our pricing works.” It was a very honest answer. It was also somewhat disillusioning, in the moment, that the pricing of the network plan was more related to the structure of the computer system that ran the billing than anything customers could perceive. I’m assuming it’s been a decade. I’m assuming everyone has upgraded their billing systems. But you announced this three-year price lock right on top of the tariffs. The marketing is that you want to give customers predictability. Lots of people have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. I have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. But that decision, you’re going to lock rates for three years, that touches your marketing, revenue, and forecasting. How do you make that kind of decision? We are in the middle of a large turnaround in the consumer business. Verizon used to take the most share of the growth. We had the lowest churn in ‘21. In 2021 and ‘22, we lost our way a little bit. My chairman, Hans, spoke about it. We got sloppy. We know it. Since then, we have been back on the turnaround track to do that. It’s a three-step turnaround. Step one for me was to fix sales. Fix our stores, fix our compensation system. Become a local company. We came to national… Everything was decided in this building. It didn’t make sense for a company our size. Step two was to take care of a price premium. We had a 40 percent price premium to the market on our plans. I think that is unsustainable for us. Look, we had a better network, we knew it, but 40 percent was too much for us. So we tweaked it. We are now down to 10 percent, 10 to 15 percent, depending on how we look at it. I think it is sustainable. We are growing our non-connectivity business really well. The third journey for me was to get my churn back in shape. Churn is the number of customers who end up leaving us every single month. It’s still very low. It’s like 0.7 or 0.8. So think about it. Nine percent of our customers leave us every year, which means our average customer stays with us for 11 years, which is crazy, by the way. And in Fios, that number is close to 20 or 30 years, depending on how you look at it. It’s a loyal base, but you want churn to go down every single time because it’s expensive to acquire customers. We spend a lot of money upfront acquiring them. For me, it was how do you get churn in a much better place? We went and asked customers. For the last four quarters, we polled customers. Nilay, I’ll give you a great tool that we built with AI, where… It’s an internal tool we built. Every day, I get half a million calls coming into my customer care centers. Every single day, they come in. And we take every one of those calls, transcribe them, and put them in a generative AI machine. At 9AM, I get a sheet of paper that tells me the sentiments, key themes, and what happened with all of yesterday’s calls. It is mind-blowing because earlier [before this tool], I had to call people. We had analysts who used to listen to calls, transcribe them, and make notes. Now every single call is put in a machine, and I get a piece. We picked up two very clear themes when I did that. The first one for me was certainty. People are like, “Everything in my life is uncertain right now. There’s uncertainty about the economy. There’s uncertainty about my job. There’s uncertainty about work from home. There’s just a lot of tension. I want certainty with prices, especially with categories I cannot live without. And phone is one of those categories.” Certainty kept coming up again and again in our reads from the market. The second thing that came up was flexibility. I never want to pay for something I don’t use. That’s one of the reasons why we took out all those inclusions. You get this free, you get that free. And people are like, “I know Disney is good. My kids love Disney, but I don’t watch Disney. Why should I have to pay for it?” Those were the two really clear insights we got from customers. That’s one. Second, we’ve done a series of price increases over the last couple of years. We had a couple in January. We know elasticity. When we do a price up, we model it. I would say the last price up we did, the elasticity was a little more than what we had modeled. That, coupled with all the insights we got from the customer, we had to respond and tell the customers that we are going to lock prices for three years. Now, it gives customers certainty. It puts a little more pressure back on us because we have to drive revenue in other ways. We have clear ways to do that, but I think it’s an industry first, especially now. Look, we knew the tariffs were coming in the day before yesterday. It was announced... It’s on TV. We are very comfortable doing that because, at a time of uncertainty, we want to give our customers some certainty and some peace of mind. All right, I’m going to be pretty hard on you now. I have covered the telecom industry for a long time. I noticed yesterday [April 3] that every other stock in the world dropped, and telecoms went up. Because people have to have your service, right? It is a requirement of modernity to be connected to the internet and to have a phone. And it feels like one of the reasons fiber customers stick around for a long time is that there’s nowhere else to go, right? The switching costs are very high, or maybe infinite, because there’s literally no other competitor that can offer the service that Fios offers, in many places. That’s true for every residential broadband provider, as competition is generally low. In mobile, the competition is basically you and AT&T, and then T-Mobile is a very strong challenger that’s gotten bigger. But Verizon and AT&T are the biggest players still. There was supposed to be a fourth player, and the government created this Dish Network deal, which I will ask you about soon. That has gone nowhere, right? There’s not actually a fourth national carrier that competes with you. When you say customers stick around for a long time, what I see is, well, there’s nowhere else to go, right? How much does that come to your thinking that, actually, a Fios customer can’t leave? A Fios customer can leave tomorrow morning. Every single Fios customer today can move to cable broadband that afternoon. There are very few Fios customers who don’t have a cable competitor in play. I just think Fios is a better solution. It’s a significantly better solution than cable because of the pricing practices they’ve had and the quality of their network. But there is a full- I hear you, and I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’ve heard that line from many, many, many telco executives in the United States. I look at the United Kingdom, for example, where they’ve done local loop unbundling. And, actually, my colleagues who live in London have 15 fiber providers at much lower prices and much higher speeds because the presence of competition is so much higher, right? It’s not literally switching from fiber to cable, a different kind of network, it’s different providers within the same fiber network offering more competition. We’ve not done that here, but they’re always switching, and you can see the prices come down because of it. I think it’s a careful balance. Canada has moved to a local loop unbundling scenario as well. The UK has always had it. That’s why European telecom has one of the lowest investments in telecom ever, in any country, almost in any region of the world today, because they just don’t have enough of a profit pool and cash flow to reinvest back in their network. Think about 5G. We are going to get to 90 percent deployment in a country as large and diverse as us. Most European countries are not even at 40 to 50 percent deployment of 5G. I think one of the things, if America wants to be competitive, if America wants to compete with China, having high-quality broadband is super important for that. Whether it’s mobility or whether it’s that. And you want to create profit pools in the system to go back and reinvest. Think about it. I’m going to invest close to $18.5 billion in just capital. In the last seven years, we’ve invested $200 billion in the network. $200 billion between spectrum and fiber, and the mobility business. I don’t see any European carrier investing $200 billion in seven years. In fact, if they invest a 10th of that, they’re going to get an award. I think it’s super important for a country to be really at the cutting edge of technology, the cutting edge of fiber, the cutting edge of 5G. And look, when 6G comes, we will be the first. I’ll tell you that today. We were the first in 5G. We beat the Koreans by 12 hours. We will beat whoever else... And most likely it’s going to be China on 6G as well. I think it’s a national security issue. It’s a national competitive issue. We need to keep reinvesting in broadband every single time, and we are not going to stop. You’ll see us investing at the same rate for a very, very long time. And all our investment is in America, in LA. I’m not investing in other countries. I’m 100 percent invested in America, and I think the profit pool lets us do that. All right, we’re here at the end, right? 5G is done, it’s deployed. Everybody has the 5G phones. What were the stakes of losing the race to 5G? No one ever gave me an answer to this question. If China had somehow won the 5G race, what would they have gotten that we didn’t get? What does it mean to lose the race? I think the first thing is standards. You want a standard that... You don’t want a bifurcation of standards, and it may happen. It could happen in the chipset, it could happen in AI, or operating systems and handsets. You’re in an interesting phase where you could potentially see a bifurcation of standards between the Western world and China. On 5G, we aligned on a very similar standard, and I think it helped because you’re able to take the price of the technology down to do that. The second is to think of all the applications and the tech economy that you have today. The app ecosystem, the Amazons of the world, the Googles of the world, and the Metas. They rely on the mobility network more than anyone else. Think about Instagram, it is worth zero without the cell phone and the connectivity. In fact- No, but specifically 5G. Instagram was worth a lot on the LTE network, and most of the 5G networks we have today are not running on millimeter wave 5G or whatever. They’re running on LTE enhanced, right? We’re still running... The core of the network here in the United States is a hybrid of 4G and 5G. No, if we had stuck with just LTE, we would not be able to take care of the capacity that’s happened. Think about it, the pandemic happened, we all moved to working from home, people… We were able to take care of those networks immediately because we had 5G; we could scale up. So 5G adds capacity in a way 4G could never have added because it comes down to spectral efficiency to do that. And we also ended up adding... Look, at the end of the day, capacity is a very simple thing. You can either add more spectrum, which is expensive, but you can add it. We do it every X years, we do that. Or you can add more cell sites because you can reuse the spectrum, or you can get back to spectral efficiency. That’s the only three ways to add capacity. And 5G helps with one in three. It puts new spectrum bands into play, and it also helps with spectral efficiency. You got a lot more capacity out of 5G, and also took the cost of capacity down. Every incremental bit that abides, depending on how you put it up in the air, the cost goes down significantly. We saw a 30 to 40 percent reduction in cost per bit when you move from 4G to 5G. Without 5G, we could not have done that. The second is that we created a whole business around fixed wireless access, providing broadband by using wireless. It’s all on 5G. It ain’t on 4G, I’ll tell you that. It’s a multi-billion-dollar business for us. In a few years... Right now, probably 50 to 60 million homes could potentially get that. It’s another competitor to broadband. And what has happened is that cable has not been able to raise prices, and so it’s a lot more beneficial to customers because they have another competitor in the space to do that. The third thing, which I think has been a little underwhelming for me, personally, is new products and services using some of the 5G capabilities. And you never get this right because you have to get the network, the handset, and the apps all perfectly aligned. I don’t think that happened very well on 5G. I think the third leg of the stool still has more work to do. I think a lot of the AR/VR type new form factors that we are seeing are going to require really low latency, and that will require 5G. You definitely can’t do it on 4G. Sitting where I am, I’m so happy we did 5G. I wish we had done it two years earlier, but that’s always the scenario. And look, we’ll keep building our network, adding more capacity till 6G is up. I sat in all the demos of all the hyped 5G applications. I went on so many self-driving car rides at CES, powered by 5G, with the data center somewhere that was driving the car for me because the latency was low. I heard a lot about robot surgery — an infinite amount about robot surgery. Those were the applications that were promised. That was the vision of the war: that if we lose the war, China will own this set of industries that is built on the new network. It was not about network capacity in COVID, right? No one foresaw that what we would need is a more efficiently run network. It was not really about bringing prices down in any substantial way, because the only thing that ever happens is prices go up. That’s the spread, right? I’m just wondering, do you see the gap in how much hype there was for 5G and how oversold it was? And also the consumer reality of it, which is, yeah, everyone’s phones might have a little more network capacity. Yes, it’s great at the concert or the football game to have millimeter wave serving everyone really fast. I agree that that’s a great use case. But it actually didn’t pan out that the big set of applications we were promised, to justify this enormous cost and all of this literal war hype. It never came to pass. Yeah, I think wireless is one of the categories that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years. Think about it. When you had 300 minutes on your phone, you were allowed... Evenings and nights were free. You remember the time when you got maybe 300 texts. You were paying more for that than you’re paying today when you get a 5G phone with unlimited data, unlimited text, and satellite messaging included. There are very few categories... In fact, the only other category I can think of that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years is TVs. Flat-screen TVs have really crashed in price. TVs and us are probably the two biggest categories that have gone up. Everything else, prices have gone up significantly. All the way from eggs to others, everything has gone up. Our prices have actually come down for what we provide there. I think the industry is probably one of the most unique industries where we tend to give you a lot more for the same amount or a little less than we did 2, 3, 5, or 10 years ago to do that. The second thing is I do... Technology is interesting. For decades, nothing happens, and then in months, decades happen. You saw that with AI, right? You and I have been listening to AI ever since we were in college, and then suddenly, two years or a year and a half ago, the whole thing exploded. I think a lot of these special cases, new applications that we are working on, tend to be like that as well. It takes a while to work it. Look, I don’t think autonomous cars or robotic surgery are going to be the ones that are going to break the bank or are going to be the breakthrough services. But I see new form factors emerging. We may be in the last generation of phone form factor as we know it right now. I think you’re going to see a lot more control of the phones using LLM models. I think it’ll have huge implications for the operating system and huge implications on the app store. But I think this may be the last generation of smartphones that we see. And to power all of the other things, we just need a better network. The second thing is that we are doing a lot more work on 5G in the industrial space. It’s not something you and I end up using a lot, but in my old job, we used to do a lot of private networks, low-latency networks, running robotics, and factory automation based on a wireless network. There’s a lot more happening in that space. When you roll out such transformational technologies, you’ve got to play the long game. Look, Verizon is a company. We are committed to America. Look, we don’t do business in other parts of the world except for small business. We are committed to America, and we want Americans to have the best network, and we’ll keep deploying capital to make that happen. I think most consumers saw 5G as something that just sort of happened to them, right? They upgraded the phone, the network is there, and then I hear you on negative inflation and value over time, but the main thing that happened is you upgraded your iPhone. Now it’s 5G capable. You need a 5G plan, and that costs more than the plan you had yesterday. That is not true. But that was true for a vast majority of people across the vast majority of the industry. The plans did get more expensive. Actually, it didn’t. If you see phone ARPU, average revenue per user, which every carrier reports in some form or the other. ARPU has moved very little on a per-phone-line basis in the last 20 years that I’ve been in the space. And you’re getting a lot more now than you got many years ago. I think people have this notion that the phone bill is going up, but the phone bill is going up because they’re signing up for new services. For example, in my case, we are going to have a $2 billion business selling streaming services and entertainment services. Now, we give great savings. We give you a 40 percent discount when you buy Disney or Netflix, Max, and all the cool services from us. But the core phone service, as you know it, has really not gone up in price. And we’ve delivered more than pretty much any other industry for the price point that we do. And I’m very, very comfortable with that equation. It’s my job as the CEO of the business to ensure that we give more to our customers. Satellite messaging is one. It’s something… We found a way, we made it work, and we included it in our plans. You pay zero for it. I think we are adding significant value to customers, which is why our churn is so low. People can move wireless easily, but because of the value we bring to them every single day, they like us and they stay with us. One of the things that’s interesting there is the comparison to televisions, which you made. The reason televisions got so cheap is that the industry realized that putting a computer in the TV let them develop huge new revenue models, right? A $500 TCL TV is actually a revenue generator because there’s advertising baked into every layer of that TV now, or effectively a free Roku box. Roku owns the entire ad stack. That’s how they make all their revenue. It’s easy for them to subsidize the TVs in that way. That’s not really the case with mobile handsets, right? It might be the case on maybe the low end of Android phones. There’s some subsidy happening there. With the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s not going to let you monetize that device as directly as anybody wants to. The push has always been to go up the stack, right? To go into the application layer. A decade ago, we had a fight about net neutrality where the carriers really wanted to be in the application layer and modify the network to prefer some applications over others. That has petered out. I think it burbles up every now and again, but it’s mostly petered out. Now you’re saying the opportunity is to bundle Disney+, right? To bundle other applications. Is that settled now that that is the strategy? Or is the push into developing custom applications for your network, or the push to prefer bandwidth for some applications? Is that incentive still there? I think what does Verizon bring to the table? We bring distribution. We bring billing and customer care. We know how to manage subscriptions. We bring a brand that has got unaided awareness of close to 100 percent. Those are the big things we bring. And I think what we’ve decided is that we want to build our non-connectivity. My non-connectivity business is almost $15 billion. It’s the size of Hilton Hotels. My non-connectivity business is a standalone company. And we partner with the best in the world to do that. I partner with Netflix. I partner with Disney. We have an insurance protection product inside that. We partner with other folks to do that piece. I think we want to use our distribution, our ability to scale subscriptions, our ability to lower the cost of acquisition, and partner with the best. But second, the more people use my network, the more excited I get. We are working very, very closely with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Google, and Apple to ensure that they use our network more to develop more services because we will monetize it at the network layer really well. Then, on top of the network, we’ll find adjacencies to sell in. But if people don’t use my network more, all the cool services I build ain’t going to matter much. I think we’ve pivoted to a strategy, which is single network, scaled network, put as much traffic on it as people can, and we’ll find ways to monetize it in a pricing construct if we do that. On top of that, we have adjacencies. We have six categories we sell into, and there we use our scale distribution, and some integration back with our network to make it real to do that. I think, in a way, we are probably the largest incubator in the world today because we work closely with companies for them to go and innovate services. It’s a pretty cool position to be in. And as we finish deploying 5G, we’ll start seeing more and more of those cool services come out. One of the things that I think about is that there was just an explosion of big carriers buying media, right? Because you have the distribution, you have the billing. It made sense to vertically integrate all the way up to the top. At one point, Verizon owned Yahoo, which was very confusing. You started what was like a prototype of TikTok called Go90, which failed almost immediately. It’s a long-running joke in our other show, The Vergecast. You owned HuffPost. You had Tumblr for a second. On the business side, you bought BlueJeans, which is a video conferencing solution. That notion that you need to actually own the icon that the user is pushing on or the media they’re consuming on the phone. AT&T bought Time Warner, another obvious disaster that collapsed almost immediately. Where did those incentives come from to do that? And do you think that they’ve gone away? Has everyone learned their lesson? Yeah, and look, it happens in every industry. Look, at the end of the day, you can either grow horizontally or you can go vertically. There are only two ways to grow. We went through a phase... Look, I was on the leadership team of Yahoo and AOL. I was sent from Verizon to help run those assets and eventually sell them. And part of the thesis was that we create data in the telco world, whether it’s clickstream data, location data, or other network data, that, if matched with online data, could create a better targeting engine for advertisers. That was a thesis going in all the way. But then we realized that customers trust us because we don’t share data. And it was a deep, insightful conversation we had within ourselves, and we realized that we should not be in a business sphere, so we sold that business. But, again, for a company our size, if you look at our enterprise value, it was still a rounding error for us. Fine, it was something we should not have done, but it was still a rounding error for us. At the end of the day, we are focused on our core. Our core tends to be mobility. Our core is fiber, and our core is cloud/AI, enabling those things. That’s it. Those are the only three businesses we are in right now. Carriers around the world have sort of come to a similar place, but we are probably, I would say, the most focused of carriers anywhere in the world right now. Verizon fights the hardest against any net neutrality rules that appear at the state level and at the federal level. We can set a watch on the Verizon lawsuit against those rules. It happens every time. You’re saying you don’t need those rules, right? If I’m listening to you correctly, you’re saying, “We’ve learned our lesson. We’re not going to monkey with the network. We’re not going to prioritize our own services or someone else’s services. We just want volume,” right? Pure volume is what will drive your growth. Why fight against the rules if you’ve already come to the same conclusion? I don’t know what net neutrality does. I’ve been in this business for a little north of 20 years. Before that, I was in college, having fun. And I still don’t know what problem we are trying to solve with net neutrality. I actually don’t understand that, because at the end of the day, if there are 300 people using a congested road, and if a firefighter needs to go through, people are going to move aside and let him go through. That’s all we are saying. For traffic management purposes, we need to have some controls in the network. Otherwise, when in New York City, when the traffic core or the emergency services want access and it’s congested, I’m going to have to move people off so they get priority service. That’s all it is. And we need traffic management tools. Or you have one person in your town who’s sucking up all the bandwidth, and we have places like that where they use 100 or 200 times the average bandwidth. And because of that, 99 percent of the people are getting a shitty experience. We’ve got to manage the traffic. That’s all we are saying about it. I think this was a little bit of drama about nothing. And at the end of the day, we want to build networks and we want people to use them. We just want the ability to manage network management in a way that’s good for the broad set of people. I don’t think we really care about making one group better versus one group worse, which is why I think it got no traction, because I don’t know what problem it was trying to solve. To be clear, it did get traction. It passed through the FCC under Title II in one administration. It was undone by another administration. I have never encountered a net neutrality rule at the federal or state level that hasn’t allowed for reasonable network management practices, right? That’s always the heart of the rule. It’s really: can you prefer some content and services over others, right? No blocking, no throttling. It’s the heart of the rules, and Verizon has fought against those. I have seen your competitors do things like sponsor data, right? I’ll let you off the hook for one second. AT&T, when they owned Max, exempted Max from their own data caps, which was just openly unfair, right? It’s just straightforwardly unfair that using Netflix would cost a customer money, and using AT&T’s owned and operated service would not. And that was an advantage that AT&T wanted to give to Max at that time. And that is the sort of thing that isn’t a firefighter on the road, that isn’t one person using all the bandwidth. That is a distortion in the market. That’s what the rule is supposed to correct. What good did it do for AT&T or for any customer in that scenario? Look, I don’t know what AT&T did, but I think at the end of the day... I don’t think a lot of these folks understand how networks work. Because at the core of these networks is a very complex set of technologies. You have the access network, you have the core, you have peering points, and you have the backbone of the network. Congestion can happen anywhere in the network. For example, if someone doesn’t come and peer with me, they’re going to get congested, but it has nothing to do with me. They’re congested because they chose not to peer with me, and they chose not to peer with me because they didn’t want to pay the $3 or three cents it needed to go and get a port in a particular porting hotel that was needed. I think the network is a very complex thing. It’s not a single pipe that starts at one end and ends at the other. There are a lot of different interfaces and other things. I think this whole concept that you’re going to unfairly manage someone’s network or give someone an unfair advantage, I don’t think it works that way. The second is an economic incentive piece. Look, in the case of AT&T, again, I’m being an academic here, which is that they bought Max, or whatever it was called back then, and they were willing to give up their dollars because network costs something. They’re able to give that up to drive sales of content. That’s a decision they made. In the end, it didn’t work out that well because it didn’t matter. I think there are economic incentives in place to manage all of this. That’s why I think net neutrality has gone literally nowhere because it doesn’t solve any problem that I think is a problem. Again, I want to be clear that it’s the law in New York. It’s the law in California. It was the law at the federal level, and it was rolled back. So, it did go somewhere at one point. And the most instructive thing I ever heard about net neutrality was that it was just the arc that Netflix went on. Netflix was once the loudest proponent of these rules. And then several years later, I saw Reed Hastings at the Code conference, he said, I believe it was to Peter Kafka, “Oh, we don’t need to have this fight anymore because we’re so big it doesn’t matter.” All that indicated to me was they needed the rule and they needed the fight when they were small, to preserve the access. And then they got so big that they didn’t need the rule to give them access because they were so big that taking access away wouldn’t be a problem. That’s the competitive playing field that I think you want at the application layer as well. It’s really hard for people to perceive. I think they didn’t realize it was a problem because it was not a problem. I think it had nothing to do with size. Well, that’s what Reed Hastings said. He said, “I am so big it doesn’t matter.” I know, but I think he probably said that to cover up something where he made a big to-do about nothing. In the end, it didn’t change anything. If customers want Netflix, they’ll get Netflix. We make shitty content, no one’s going to watch it. I think it’s the core of that issue. He very soon realized... I remember that conference. He realized this was a fight about nothing. At the end of the day, if you make good content, customers want it, they’ll appear, and you’ll get access to it. If you make poor content that nobody wants to watch, nobody’s going to watch it. Irrespective of all the so-called net neutrality rules you have. I think that was the perfect example of how it had nothing to do with size. It just had to do with the fact that they were chasing something that made no sense at that point, and he was the first to admit it, so he could focus his efforts on putting on new shows. By the way, I like their new show, The Residence. It’s a good show. You live in a different regulatory environment now. You have Brendan Carr, who’s the chair of the FCC. I’m not a fan of Brendan Carr. I think he’s wielding his power irresponsibly, and he knows that I think that. You mentioned earlier your deal with Frontier, that’s going to go through, and Brendan has been very clear that he will not allow these deals to go through unless you get rid of all your diversity initiatives. And he says there’s an investigation against Verizon on these initiatives. That feels like straight coercion. If Verizon wants to go body up and file lawsuits against the FCC imposing regulatory requirements, this would be where you do it. Are you going to fight that fight, or are you going to roll over? For Verizon, there are a couple of things. Internally, as a company, certain things are non-negotiable for us. How we treat human beings, human dignity, and ensure that we have the best talent pool when we build and operate the largest consumer telco company in the world. We ain’t walking away from that. I think that’s there. At the end of the day, we have to follow the rules and regulations of the land, and we will work constructively. We have a constructive dialogue with the FCC to ensure that we follow the rules and regulations of the land. That’s exactly the piece we are in right now with them. We got the letter from them. We are working closely with the staffers out there. Whatever the regulations or rules of the land are, we’ll follow them. Do you think that you’ll fight that as vociferously as you fought net neutrality? It goes down to the rule of law. Whatever the rule is. Do you think the FCC commissioner has the authority to tell you how to hire and fire inside your company? It goes back to the rules and regulations that the administration puts in place. They have certain rules, they work through it, and we have to follow the rules of the way it lays itself out. That’s all we are going to work towards: a constructive dialogue with Chairman Carr on that piece, and we’ll continue to deliver that. But at the end of the day, I want the best talent pool for my company. I will do anything that is needed to get the best operators, the best marketers, and the best network operators in the world for Verizon to do that piece. I’m walking away from that. I’m going to follow that. In the process, I have to follow rules and regulations — we’ll do that. And if there are some changes that have to be made, we will make those changes. But let’s not forget, this is about getting the best talent from us, and we are not walking away one minute from that mission. Literally, just a few days before we’re talking, I think T-Mobile closed the deal to do a JV on some fiber initiative. But to get there, they had to delete the word diversity from a bunch of its web pages. Is that the level of meddling that you’re willing to accept? We are still working with the FCC on what the rules are. How we develop the rules. How we execute the rules on that. It’s a work in progress right now. We are still working through that. But look, at the end of the day, we’re going to have to follow the rules of the land. We did that before, we’ve done that. We’re going to do that after that. This is just one of those pieces, we’re going to have to follow the rules that are there. I want to be very clear, I’m being very explicit about this. When the government passed net neutrality rules, it wasn’t, “We have to follow the rules of the land.” It was, “We are going to file lawsuits for a decade to get out of these rules because we think they’re dumb.” And in this case, you’re saying Brendan Carr, who has been openly censorious, openly chilling of speech, openly hostile to companies because they have diversity initiatives — you’re saying you just have to follow his rules? We have to follow the rules of the land. I don’t think those are his rules. They are the rules of the land and administration — Are you going to file a decade’s worth of lawsuits about these rules? We don’t know. We’re going to work constructively with them to follow the rules that are needed. But at the end of the day... Look, our role is to the stakeholders that we have. My stakeholders are my shareholders, my customers, my employees, and society at large. We have to manage, and we are going to deliver to those stakeholders what’s needed for us, and we will do whatever is needed with the administration to deliver to all the stakeholders. When you run a large company our size, you have to balance the different stakeholders, and we will balance those stakeholders. We’ve done it extremely well in the last 25 years that we’ve been Verizon, and we’ll continue to do that going forward. Can you put this in your decision matrix? When you look at an administration that shows up and says, “We’re going to start meddling with your deals.” From an agency that traditionally has not done this specific kind of meddling in how you hire and fire, how do you think about that decision in your two-by-two matrix? This is not the first deal we’ve taken through administrations. We worked with Democrats, we worked with Republicans, we worked with both sets of the administration. We’ve had good success working with both of them on that piece. Every time we take a deal through, there are trade-offs that have to be made. When we bought TracFone, we had trade-offs we had to make with California that were probably not perfect for us as well. I do think there are trade-offs that need to be made in any large transaction. But at the end of the day, you have to follow the rules of the land. I think that’s the most important thing, and we’ve got to manage the stakeholders. And that’s pretty much all we are going to do here. All right. I want to wrap up by asking you about a very silly thing from the first Trump administration. In the first Trump administration, T-Mobile bought Sprint. And at the time, that set of players in Trump one concocted a deal where Sprint would sell some assets to Dish Network, and we would invest in a thing called Open RAN to get away from Huawei and have more competition at the tower level. These are all good ideas in theory. Have you spent one minute thinking about the competition posed by Dish Network? Look, we have three large wireless carriers in a very, very competitive market. We have Dish with its Boost network, which is competitive in the prepaid space. They’re a pretty large player in the prepaid space. They’re starting to build postpaid. Then you have the cable companies today, Comcast, Charter, and Cox, all offer wireless services at very competitive prices. In fact, in many cases, the first line is free, and their average ARPU is significantly lower than ours. It is one of the most competitive telco markets in the world today. Three full players, a fourth facility player who is building up, and then a cable company that has 100 percent coverage of the country, which is able to offer wireless. It’s a pretty competitive market that we have in this space right now. No, but I’m asking you specifically about Dish, right? That was five years ago. I think June or July of 2020. That deal was completed. They had access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years. We’re coming to the end of that. They are supposed to have a next-generation 5G Open RAN that is a national competitor to you by now. Do you think they have a national, competitive Open RAN that causes you to lose any sleep? They’re a competitor to us. They have, I think, a little less than... The Boost network creates millions and tens of millions of customers — But that’s just what they bought from Sprint. That was the existing asset they bought from Sprint. That’s not the thing they were meant to build. They’ve built local networks. And do we compete with them? We compete with them in the space. But think about it, we have three full networks that are building up, and then we have competition. This is one of the most competitive markets. Look, Open RAN is a completely different animal. We should definitely talk about that. Look, over a period of time, Open RAN is a good thing, because it deconstructs the network a little bit. You can have multiple players in a stack. And for folks who are not close to this, today, when we buy equipment from a partner, we end up buying almost the whole stack. The head end that goes on to the tower, all the equipment at the bottom of the tower, is from a single provider. And Open RAN says, “Make those interfaces more standardized so that you can mix and match operators more easily.” I think philosophically, Open RAN is a good concept. I think more work is needed to get to the performance that makes us comfortable using it at scale. But what we’ve done is we’ve virtualized our networks more than any other carrier in the world. What does that mean? We’ve put generic hardware in our sites, and then the equipment providers have to load their software on it. We think that’s actually a more powerful tool in mix and match, scaling, and loading cost than sometimes de-standardizing or standardizing these interfaces. But over a period of time, it’s important to have more diversity of vendors and have more people play in this space. It’s good for us, it’s good for the economy. I think we are very supportive of O-RAN. We are part of the Alliance. We spend a lot of time, energy, and money on R&D and making those interfaces stable. But I feel it has a little more to go before they’re standardized, and they give you the performance that I get to put on my network. Well, Sampath, you’ve given us a lot of time. I feel like you should come back and we should talk about Open RAN for a full hour, because I can. I think it is fascinating. We’ll have to have you back soon. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

Title: What’s So Special About Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Trading Activities?

Time Published: 2025-04-21T14:46:30Z
Full Content:
One of the most interesting investors over the past few years isn’t some hedge fund manager or Wall St veteran, it’s congressional representative Nancy Pelosi. Her investing disclosures include early bets on Nvidia and Tempus AI before both companies had a massive run-up in valuation, along with many other profitable trades. While insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of congress, many people believe that she could be using confidential information from her insights into laws before they’re made public. That doesn’t mean that people can’t also benefit from her trades, however. How are people taking advantage? While the obvious best-case-scenario would be for this kind of political trading to be banned, one company decided that regular people should be able to get similar exposure to her trades. That’s where Dub, and their affiliate Dub Advisors comes in. They’ve built an app that has access to a model portfolio that tracks her trading strategies and automatically rebalances whenever her moves are publicly announced. Since their $PELOSI portfolio launched on September 27, 2023, it’s returned 77.34% as of April 1, 2025. Why follow politician trades? Politicians may have access to information or insights that are not readily available to the public. For example, they may have insights into how upcoming legislation or regulations will impact specific industries and companies. In some cases, they might even anticipate global events through sensitive briefings or influence a company’s prospects through their legislative power. Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio aims to capitalize on these potential information advantages by purchasing stocks that Pelosi has bought. How is the $PELOSI portfolio constructed? Dub Advisors built the $PELOSI portfolio using public financial disclosures required by the STOCK Act. These disclosures provide information about securities transactions made by members of Congress and other senior government officials. While the portfolio is constructed from these disclosures, it isn’t an exact replica of Pelosi’s investments. Due to reporting and technical limitations, that’s not feasible. Instead, they apply proprietary techniques used by hedge funds to design a portfolio with the most potential to outperform the market. Their strategy for creating politician portfolios focuses on two key factors: While their exact methods are proprietary, some concrete ways that Dub Advisors find stocks with high conviction and information asymmetry are: While past performance does not guarantee future results, PELOSI’s excellent performance thus far has boosted their confidence in this methodology. Doesn’t the 45-day reporting delay hurt returns? Politicians have 45 days to report their stock transactions, meaning that we find out about their trades well after they happen. While it would be ideal to know about trades instantly, the 45-day reporting lag does not render their strategy ineffective. Most politicians buy and hold for long periods of time. For example, Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio has continuously held a position in NVDA since inception in September 2023, so a 45 day delay doesn’t affect overall performance much. Moreover, politicians often report trades well before the 45-day limit since there is no benefit to delaying. For example, Pelosi’s most recent buy of NVDA occurred on July 25, 2024, and was reported on July 31, 2024. How to invest in the $PELOSI portfolio Want to invest?

Title: Nvidia stock slips as U.S. curbs backfire, boosting China’s chip ambitions
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-nasdaq-sp500-huawei-china-chips-1851777025
Time Published: 2025-04-21T13:48:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 6% Monday as investors digested growing fallout from the Biden and Trump administrations’ efforts to curb the company’s chip sales to China. The latest restrictions — announced last week by the White House — tighten the noose on Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced AI chips abroad. Now Chinese competitors appear ready to fill the gap. A sharp blow came Monday from reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its own advanced AI chip — the 910C — as early as next month. The move underscores China’s accelerating effort to sidestep U.S. technology restrictions, and positions Huawei, one of China’s largest tech companies, as a potential beneficiary of the crackdown on Nvidia. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) told CNBC (CMCSA) the new export rules may ultimately “do more to help Chinese chip companies than hurt them,” by forcing domestic buyers to pivot away from U.S. suppliers. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang traveled to China last week for damage control, attempting to reassure partners and regulators that the company still wants to do business there. The White House’s tighter restrictions — part of a tech containment strategy and one more front in the administration’s trade war — specifically target Nvidia’s H20 chip, a product originally designed to comply with earlier export rules. The decision marks a strategic shift: a U.S. willingness to inflict damage on its own most valuable semiconductor company to prevent China from gaining access to leading-edge AI tools. Beijing, for its part, has slammed the U.S. approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Shares of Nvidia are down about 19% in the last month. The Nasdaq has fallen 12% over the same period, while the S&P 500 is down almost 10%. Nvidia’s global significance helps explain the U.S. market’s swift reaction. With a market cap approaching $2.5 trillion, it’s not only the world’s most valuable chipmaker, but the foundational force in AI infrastructure — powering data centers, large language models, and emerging technologies across sectors. Analysts estimate Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI training chip market, making it a linchpin in the global tech arms race. Its dominance also means Nvidia’s stock movements can sway the entire U.S. market. The company now makes up more than 6% of the Nasdaq 100 and about 5.5% of the S&P 500. As a result, Washington’s deepening trade war with China isn’t just geopolitical theater — it’s triggering real volatility and wiping out investor value across indexes, with Nvidia squarely in the middle of the storm.

Title: Cybersecurity’s Red Alert Moment: Hyperscalers Are Consolidating Power
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2025/04/21/cybersecuritys-red-alert-moment-hyperscalers-are-consolidating-power/

ByEmil Sayegh ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. Hyperscalers are absorbing cybersecurity into their platforms — just as they did with storage, ... More compute and databases. Cybersecurity is no longer a standalone industry — it is becoming a native function of cloud infrastructure as evidenced by Google’s recent purchase of Wiz for a staggering $32B. As hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud embed AI-powered security features into their platforms, the $30 billion Managed Detection and Response market faces an existential threat. This isn’t just vendor jostling — it has deep implications for enterprise IT budgets, private equity-backed investments and even national security. For years, hyperscalers operated as neutral enablers — providing compute and storage while security vendors built the intelligence layer. But history tells us what happens next. First it was storage, then compute, then databases. Now it is security. The same pattern is unfolding again — and this time, they are not just partners. They are poised to be predators. History is the roadmap — and it shows exactly how they plan to attack and absorb this vulnerable, fragmented security services market. What was once outsourced — threat detection, endpoint protection, identity access management and data loss prevention — is now being baked directly into the core of their platforms. Embedded, automated and bundled — not sold as a product, but delivered as a feature. The original relationship was symbiotic. Security vendors brought innovation, the clouds brought scale. But now that balance has collapsed. The hyperscalers are no longer just competing — they are outpacing. They are building security into every layer of their platforms — from AI-powered identity controls to default encryption and automated threat intelligence. And because they control the infrastructure, they control the data. They have access to platform-native telemetry, logs and behaviors that no third party can match. The use of artificial intelligence gives them yet another advantage — one measured not in features but in speed, integration and insight. While independent providers race to keep up, the clouds are already embedding adaptive security into the very foundation of modern IT. MDR vendors like eSentire, Arctic Wolf, Expel, ReliaQuest and Rapid7 have grown fast by investing in automation and extended detection capabilities. But they are running uphill. These firms must build, market and sell their platforms to survive — all while hyperscalers quietly integrate competing capabilities into enterprise agreements. Look at Rapid7 — one of the only publicly traded players in this space. In 2024, it reported $844 million in revenue, up 9 percent year over year, with a 19 percent operating margin. But its stock fell 41 percent. Activist investor Jana Partners, holding a 5.8 percent stake, forced board changes and is now demanding a sale or strategic overhaul. Why? Because markets can smell what’s coming — margin compression and disruption from the inside out. Consider Microsoft Defender, Amazon GuardDuty, Google Chronicle and Microsoft Sentinel. These tools are not sold — they are embedded. They are often activated by default and subsidized through broader infrastructure contracts. They do not need to generate standalone profit — they exist to increase stickiness, lower churn and lock in the customer. In 2024 alone, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta spent over $250 billion in capital expenditures — much of it directed at embedding AI and security across their platforms. That figure is larger than the entire combined valuation of independent cybersecurity vendors. This is not competition. It is gravitational collapse, and it is exactly what happened in the last decade to smaller infrastructure providers. Artificial intelligence is the core disruptor. Hyperscalers are not merely building smarter tools — they are reinventing the security stack from the inside. AI is being trained on massive datasets, with full access to platform behaviors, identity systems and telemetry that no outsider can replicate. The result is security that is real-time, adaptive and invisible — not bolted on, but built in. That is not incremental innovation. That is systemic displacement. Regulators are waking up, but the question is whether it too late before the damage is done. In April 2025, Google lost its second antitrust case in less than a year. Meta is under scrutiny for monopolistic bundling. The hypercalers strategy is familiar — extend the platform, entrench the offering, exclude the competition. Cybersecurity is next. When hyperscalers start bundling endpoint detection and response, policy enforcement and threat management into their infrastructure deals — while underpricing or disabling competitive solutions — regulators will ask whether these behaviors mirror the extend-and-entrench tactics already flagged in other sectors. The questions now on the table in Washington and Brussels: This is not just a shift in architecture — it is a realignment of power. As cybersecurity collapses inward into the cloud platform itself, the ripple effects are being felt across the entire ecosystem. Every stakeholder — from service providers to financial sponsors to national defense agencies — must now reassess assumptions, business models and risk profiles. Managed Service Providers and Managed Security Service Providers built their business models on integrating best-of-breed, third-party cybersecurity tools — layering value through orchestration, visibility and incident response. But that stack is being flattened. Hyperscalers are disintermediating this layer by offering native tools that are cheaper, easier to deploy and pre-integrated with the infrastructure itself. Margins are under pressure. Many MSSPs rely on licensing arbitrage and volume-based resale models that are collapsing as cloud-native security offerings become bundled and commoditized. According to Canalys, spending on MSSPs is growing at just 8 percent annually — a slowdown from prior years — even as demand for cybersecurity services remains strong. That delta reflects erosion in value capture. Differentiation is also eroding. When every enterprise workload sits on a platform that already includes threat detection, identity and log correlation, MSSPs must go deeper — into vertical-specific advisory, regulatory mapping, zero-trust strategy and response playbooks. Those that cannot evolve beyond tool management will become expendable. The next-generation MSSP must pivot away from being a product stack integrator and toward being a trusted advisor. That means investing in proprietary frameworks, industry depth and human-led services that the hyperscalers — by design — cannot replicate. The private equity community has invested tens of billions into roll-ups, platform plays and specialty MSSPs under a common thesis: scale drives efficiency, and efficiency drives margins. But when hyperscalers remove the very foundation of third-party tool layers, that thesis begins to unravel. Multiples are already under pressure. Valuations that assumed sustainable 20 to 30 percent EBITDA on recurring security services may no longer hold. As bundled features reduce the need for outsourced detection or SIEM management, customer stickiness weakens — and churn risk increases. In several recent transactions, we’ve seen diligence processes stall or valuations renegotiated after cloud-native roadmap reviews showed major overlap with portfolio offerings. Even public market signals are clear — Rapid7’s steep stock price decline, despite revenue growth, reflects investor skepticism on long-term margin durability in this segment. Sponsors must now re-underwrite portfolios and exit timelines. The path forward lies in pushing platform companies into verticals or service layers that maintain pricing power — compliance-as-a-service, specialized forensics, incident response retainers — rather than assuming the old playbook of bundling tools will survive. There is no margin for error when it comes to national defense. Yet the same hyperscaler platforms that now power enterprise productivity are also hosting some of the most sensitive workloads in the world — from defense contractors and intelligence agencies to critical infrastructure providers. As cybersecurity becomes a native feature of these platforms, we are not just consolidating capabilities — we are consolidating control and amplifying systemic risk. This introduces a dangerous paradox: the cloud has become both the fortress and the attack surface. A single breach. A single rogue insider. A single software update gone wrong. That’s all it takes. The consequences could cascade across military logistics, energy grids, transportation systems and real-time battlefield surveillance. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2020 SolarWinds breach exposed how deeply embedded vulnerabilities can compromise trusted environments. In 2024, we saw how a single botched CrowdStrike update grounded flights, froze retailers and disabled hospital systems. The next time, it could be a compromised core service — not just a patch — and the damage could be exponential. Even more concerning is the opacity of the platforms themselves. When detection, prevention and response functions are all owned, operated and monitored by the same cloud provider, transparency disappears. Federal agencies are left with limited visibility and reduced oversight — unable to independently validate the integrity of the systems they now depend on. At the very moment when national cybersecurity defense should be distributed and resilient, we are centralizing it into a small number of hyperscaler environments. That may be efficient — but it is not safe. And it is certainly not sustainable. The same fate that befell private cloud hosting companies — disintermediated by the public cloud — now threatens MDR and MSSP vendors. This is not theoretical. This is déjà vu. And it is already underway. The industry has five years — maybe less — to adapt. That means redefining value, moving up the stack and delivering what the hyperscalers cannot: trust, objectivity, service and independence. If not, the industry will consolidate further — and this time, the collapse will be silent. This is not just a technology trend. It is a restructuring of the cybersecurity marketplace. And it is happening in real time. The only question is — will vendors, investors and regulators respond before it is too late?

Title: Stocks to watch today: Nvidia slips, Netflix rallies, and Big Tech gets ready to report

U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday as Wall Street braces for a high-stakes week of earnings and mounting geopolitical uncertainty. The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%, and the Dow was off more than 400 points. The VIX surged nearly 10%, while gold spiked 2.65% to $3,416.70 — its highest level ever. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were down about 4% premarket following reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. The move signals China’s accelerating push to replace U.S. technology in sensitive sectors and adds pressure on Nvidia, already under fire from new White House restrictions on chip sales. Analysts warn that Nvidia’s role as a strategic asset in the U.S.-China trade standoff could make it especially vulnerable — with powerful knock-on effects for overall U.S. markets, given Nvidia’s position as one of the largest American companies by market cap. Netflix (NFLX) is one of the rare bright spots in early trading, rising roughly 2% after delivering a blockbuster Q1. The company posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.54 billion in revenue. Its $7.99 ad-supported tier is seen as more resilient in a tightening economy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) remains in focus after last week’s rout, when the stock lost more than 20% on a forecast cut and earnings miss. Shares were slightly lower again Monday morning. This week also brings earnings from Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Boeing (BA), and Procter & Gamble (PG), setting the tone for Q2 amid rising fears of a “self-inflicted” recession. In a Sunday memo, analysts at Wedbush said: “The markets and tech world needs to find a path forward quickly and know what the rules of the game are looking ahead. The White House needs trade deals done quick with a negotiation path established with China.” The alternative was grim: “Otherwise the markets, 10-year yield, USD, gold, and the economy will head down their own divergent paths over the coming weeks and months ahead. We view this as a key week ahead to get some trade deals on the board as the Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 21, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: The Dow drops 400 points and the Nasdaq reels as earnings season meets tariff chaos

U.S. stocks dropped sharply Monday, continuing a volatile stretch for Wall Street as geopolitical tensions, earnings anxiety, and Federal Reserve uncertainty continue to collide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest salvo against Powell came days after he said the central bank chief’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” The attacks have deepened investor fears over the Fed’s independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It’s no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere — from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared to hand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 6% ahead of Tuesday’s earnings as investors brace for lackluster results and look for any sign of stabilization in demand or margins. With more than 100 companies reporting earnings this week — including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Boeing (BA), and Procter & Gamble (PG) — traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was down after reports that Huawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing’s push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology — and deepens investor anxiety around Nvidia’s access to the massive Chinese market after the White House imposed additional rules on the company’s chip sales. It’s been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-“Liberation Day” levels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that’s grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is “self-inflicted,” concluding bluntly: “We are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.” One bright spot? Netflix (NFLX). In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted an almost-$3-billion profit on $10.54 billion in revenue — with an eye-popping 31.7% operating margin. Wall Street seems especially approving of Netflix’s ad-supported $7.99 monthly membership, which appears less vulnerable to recession-driven household savings measures.

Title: Should You Buy The Current Dip In Novo Nordisk Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BAGSVæRD, DENMARK - 2025/03/27: A view of the logo of Novo Nordisk A/S at the headquarters in ... More Bagsværd. Novo Nordisk A/S is a Danish multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Bagsværd. (Photo by Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock has experienced a significant decline, dropping 35% from over $90 in early March to around $58 currently. Several factors have contributed to this downward trend. The most recent impact stems from Eli Lilly meeting the primary goals in a late-stage trial for its daily diabetes pill. If approved, this pill's convenience could pose a competitive threat to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic injection, potentially leading to market share shifts. Additionally, concerns about Novo Nordisk's pipeline, which is perceived as less diversified than some competitors, alongside rising market competition, have also weighed on the stock. However, we believe that these concerns are now largely reflected in the current stock price. In fact, we consider NVO stock at around $58 to be extremely attractive, making it a compelling buying opportunity. Our view is that there is minimal fundamental cause for concern with Novo Nordisk; its current valuation appears exceptionally low, contributing significantly to its attractiveness. This conclusion is based on a thorough analysis comparing NVO’s current valuation with its operating performance over recent years, as well as its present and historical financial condition. Our assessment of Novo Nordisk across key parameters including Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains very strong operating performance and financial health, as will be detailed further. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NVO stock’s valuation looks moderate compared to the broader market. Novo Nordisk’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Novo Nordisk’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Novo Nordisk's balance sheet looks strong. NVO stock has been much more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Novo Nordisk's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Based on Novo Nordisk’s exceptionally strong performance across key metrics and its current moderate valuation, we believe the stock is highly attractive at its current price of $58. While past performance is strong, future prospects are also compelling. Novo Nordisk’s sales are forecast to achieve high-teen average growth over the next three years. Coupled with its robust profit margin exceeding 40%, a significant portion of this top-line growth is expected to translate directly into shareholder value. Although challenges such as increasing competition and the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on drug pricing exist, we believe these risks are adequately reflected in the stock’s current moderate valuation. Therefore, we believe that NVO represents a very good buying opportunity at this level. While NVO stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Congress’s Biggest Financial Priority Is “Stablecoin.” What the Hell Is That?

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Instead of tackling crashing markets, Congress is pushing a crypto sector that the Trump family is financially involved in. The Trump administration’s trade war with the world has roiled the stock market and threatens to plunge the country into a recession while jacking up the price of basic supplies. But instead of taking on the financial issues dominating the headlines, the House and Senate are racing to bring stablecoins — a cryptocurrency sector few Americans have even heard of — out from the shadows. The $230 billion stablecoin industry could be the first to benefit from Donald Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the world’s “crypto capital of the planet.” “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained.” Industry advocates say the legislation will clear up uncertainty around the regulation of their cryptocurrencies, unleashing a new era of financial innovation. Critics of the bipartisan push warn that the legislation risks another financial crash while enriching Trump, whose family is launching a stablecoin of their own. “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained. We saw that with the Trump meme coin, where a lot of people lost out but it didn’t matter because Trump’s platform was making fees,” said Mark Hays, of the group Americans for Financial Reform. “It just seems like a witches’ brew of problematic things that could lead to another crash.” To their proponents, stablecoins offer all the benefits of crypto without the downsides. They are pegged to real-world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The idea is that one dollar-denominated stablecoin can always be redeemed for one dollar. Stablecoin issuers use real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, to back their offerings. Stablecoins live on blockchains — cryptographically protected digital ledgers — just like more famous tokens like bitcoin or Ether. Unlike bitcoins, they are supposed to be insulated from wild price swings by their currency pegs. That hasn’t stopped some stablecoins from collapsing. Boosters say that stablecoins can make payments faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They argue that stablecoins will make it easier to send money across international borders and create opportunities for the unbanked by cutting out traditional financial institutions. So far, however, they’re mostly used to buy other cryptocurrencies. Crypto traders use them to cash in and cash out of more speculative tokens without paying repeated fees. Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has likened them to “poker chips at the casino.” Critics say that even though the biggest stablecoin was launched in 2014, the high-minded talk of improving the payment system has yet to produce results, and the only major users so far have been crypto traders, criminals seeking to evade money laundering laws, and people in the developing world whose own currencies face runaway inflation. “They have been around for a decade. There is no doubt people have been trying to turn them into a general-purpose payment instrument,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a professor emeritus at the George Washington University law school. “And it really hasn’t worked out.” That’s what their promoters would have you believe. In reality, stablecoins have “depegged” from the dollar dozens of times. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022, leading stablecoin issuer Tether saw its titular offering drop from the dollar by more than 2 cents. The second-biggest stablecoin, Circle’s USD Coin, dropped more than 13 cents amid revelations that many of its cash assets were jeopardized by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Then there was the notorious TerraUSD coin, an “algorithmic” stablecoin that was not backed by real-world assets. Its collapse took the token’s supposed value of $40 billion down to zero. Despite the promise of more concrete assets backing today’s leading stablecoins, even crypto boosters have questions about Tether. The El Salvador-based stablecoin keeps only 82 percent of its reserves in cash or cash-like instruments, dividing up the rest in more volatile investments such as bitcoin. Moreover, it has never subjected its reserve to a full financial audit. Tether is closely aligned with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose former firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds much of the Tether’s U.S. Treasury bonds. The very promise of stability can lead to runs on stablecoins, experts say. “If people think that even a few pennies of their dollar are at risk, they are going to run,” Wilmarth said. “They are not thinking, ‘I’ve put this money in the S&P 500, and I’ll ride it up and down.’” Trump has said he wants to sign a stablecoin bill by August. If it does, the legislation would be one of a handful of signature initiatives he approves this year — raising the question of why this niche topic is so important to Congress and the White House. Even supporters of the idea of passing stablecoin legislation say the urgency seems to be motivated in large part by the industry’s torrent of campaign spending. “That has had an effect,” said Tim Massad, the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, who served as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama. “There’s a valid substantive reason to prioritize it, in that stablecoins exist and we have been talking about it for a while, and I think there’s also some political reason why it’s being prioritized.” Two bills pending in Congress, the STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate, would largely accomplish the same industry-friendly goals if passed. Both bills would carve stablecoins out from securities law and the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And both would allow some stablecoin issuers to opt for state-level regulation instead of federal, potentially letting them to shop for friendlier jurisdictions. The bills would also create reserve requirements limiting what stablecoins can use as collateral, prohibiting them from investing in riskier assets such as bitcoins. That is also where critics start to see problems: The Senate bill would allow stablecoins to use money market funds, which had to be bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2020, as collateral. Meanwhile, both bills would ban regulators from imposing tighter reserve requirements designed to protect against market crashes. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Neither bill goes far enough to outlaw foreign issuers of dollar-denominated stablecoins, potentially creating an incentive for issuers to move offshore and outside of U.S. regulation, according to Massad. And neither provides the Treasury Department with broad-enough authority to crack down on illicit finance, he said. Moreover, both bills would allow non-banks to enter the stablecoin market, Wilmarth said, opening the door for Big Tech companies such as Meta or Amazon to get in on the action. “Not only Big Tech but Big Finance,” he said. “They would have every piece of information about you if they could run all your basic financial transactions through their systems. I think that creates enormous concerns and problems.” If Big Tech does enter the stablecoin market, critics warn, a run on their coins could lead to a larger financial contagion. “You’re linking the commercial sector of our economy to our financial sector,” Wilmarth said. “Mark Twain supposedly said, ‘You can put all your eggs in one basket, but you better watch that basket.’” Last month, members of the Trump family announced that they were getting in on the stablecoin game themselves through their World Liberty Financial venture. The firm is helmed by the sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Like other stablecoins, it promises to be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, with regular audits of its reserves. Massad said he could think of no similar move by other presidents. “Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a trust, but peanut farm regulation wasn’t exactly a big issue back then,” Massad said. “I think it’s totally inappropriate for the president or members of his family to be launching a stablecoin or otherwise engaging in crypto businesses.” The announcement of the Trump stablecoin didn’t just add another potential conflict of interest to the mountain of existing ones. It also alarmed crypto industry figures, who had been counting on stablecoin legislation as a surefire win this Congress after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians in both major parties during last year’s election cycle. Both bills seemed destined to attract widespread, bipartisan support until the Trumps entered the picture. Instead, at a House Financial Services Committee meeting earlier this month, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member of the committee, denounced the Trumps and said she could not be involved in passing a bill that would further enrich them. The House bill still passed out of committee with support from six Democrats, giving it a bipartisan sheen. The Senate’s stablecoin bill is co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott, along with Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Kirsten Gillibrand. WAIT!

Title: Tesla’s caught in a trade war trap. Blame Elon Musk
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/business/musk-tesla-investors-call/index.html

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: CE 100 Index Slips 0.2% as United Healthcare Plunges After Earnings

The CE 100 Index barely budged in a holiday-shortened trading week, down 0.2%. Earnings continued to dominate the headlines, and six pillars were lower, while five gained marginal ground. United Healthcare Declines on Medicare Advantage Outlook Leading to the downside in the “Be Well” segment of the CE 100 Index, which lost 3.7%, United Healthcare shares plunged 24%. The company reported earnings that CEO Andrew Witty said, showed “overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable,” according to remarks on the conference call with analysts. The company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $26-$26.50 per share, down from $29.50-$30. Revised guidance was lower than the Street expected, and the outlook was driven in part by “heightened care activity indications within [its] Medicare Advantage businesses, which became visible as the quarter closed, far above the planned 2025 increase, which was consistent with the elevated levels in 2024,” the release said. “This activity was most notable within physician and outpatient services.” Nvidia shares lost more than 8%, taking the Enablers segment of the CE 100 Index 2.3% lower. Nvidia said Monday (April 14) that its artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers will be built in the U.S. for the first time, starting in the next 12 to 15 months. The company is working with manufacturing partners to build two manufacturing plants in Texas — one in Houston with Foxconn and one in Dallas with Wistron — and expects to begin mass production within that timeframe. Also within the Enablers group, and as reported this week, the antitrust case against Meta Platforms in federal district court began with FTC attorney Daniel Matheson telling the judge Meta “decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” according to reports from inside the courtroom. The FTC is seeking to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the commission originally had approved in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The tech giant has countered that the case is “weak” and that the case engages in “revisionist history.” Payments-related names countered some of these losses. BNPL stalwart Sezzle was 16% higher. FIS shares were 3.1%. Global Payments sold its issuer solutions business to FIS for $13.5 billion and bought Worldpay for a net price of $22.7 billion. Worldpay is co-owned by FIS and private equity firm GTCR. PayPal shares lost 2.5%. The company announced that it and TerraPay are teaming to promote cross-border payments in the Middle East and Africa. The partnership is designed to speed cross-border money movement, while making payments more accessible by connecting banks, mobile wallets and financial institutions. TerraPay — via secure PayPal account linking — will act as an enabler, allowing mobile wallet and bank users across the MENA region to transfer funds to their PayPal accounts. American Express shares were up a slight 0.1%. PYMNTS’ coverage of first quarter earnings indicated that FX-adjusted basis, revenue rose 8% year over year — or 9% when factoring out the leap year impact — to $17 billion. Total Card Member spending also grew at 7% excluding the extra day. The full-year forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50, the ranges first set in January. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” CEO Stephen Squeri said on the conference call with analysts.

Title: POLL: 81% of Americans fear job loss amid surging layoffs and economic uncertainty

A survey reveals 81 percent of U.S. workers fear unemployment in 2025, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" than in 2024, as layoffs rise and economic instability grows. The survey reveals that employees are having a pessimistic labor market outlook, with 76 percent predicting increased layoffs, 92 percent preparing for a recession, 63 percent expecting more business closures and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout due to workload and job insecurity. With "The Great Stay" trend, employees hesitate to switch jobs due to uncertainty â only four percent feel completely secure, while 61 percent plan to upskill to stay competitive. There are also several key burnout drivers, including job insecurity (43 percent), increased workloads (29 percent) and poor work-life balance (23 percent). Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability.

Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability. A new survey has revealed that theÂ vast majority of U.S. workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs in 2025, as layoffs continue to rise and economic instability looms. According to a report by My Perfect Resume,Â titled "The Great Stay: 2025 State of the Labor Market," 81 percent of workers fear job loss this year, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" about unemployment than they did in 2024. The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on?

All the sales were in January and February when Meta’s stock was still trading above $US600, hitting a peak of more than $US736 on Valentine’s Day. The social-media company’s share price has since slid 32 per cent amid the broader market sell-off. Another top seller was Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive officer, who unloaded 3.8 million shares worth $US705 million before the tech giant’s stock fell more than 30 per cent. Those proceeds, combined with her remaining stake and investment portfolio, give her a fortune of $US2.4 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing her net worth for the first time. Dimon, CEO of the largest US bank, sold about $US234 million of stock during the quarter. He has a net worth of $US3 billion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

While technology stocks surged early in Trump’s presidency, the uncertainty over tariffs in the lead-up to April 2 – his so-called “Liberation Day” – helped prompt a sell-off that chopped trillions of dollars off global markets. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has seen his wealth tumble $US129 billion so far this year as uncertainty over tariffs, which could affect everything from phones to semiconductors, have hit tech industry stocks hard. Already, some billionaire insiders are using the opportunity to buy shares at depressed prices and increase their stakes. Insider selling overall was down compared with the first quarter of 2024, when 4702 insiders unloaded shares worth a total of $US28.1 billion, compared with $US15.5 billion from 3867 sellers this year, according to Washington Service.

Title: Weekly news roundup: Huawei accelerates, Nvidia reels, and TSMC anchors next wave of US chip reshoring

Credit: AFP These are the most-read DIGITIMES Asia stories from the week of April 14 – April 20. Huawei unveils new AI chip just one day after US bans Nvidia's H20 exports Just one day after the US banned exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China, Huawei launched its Ascend 920 on April 10. Slated for mass production in late 2025, the chip delivers over 900 TFLOPS, 4,000 GB/s bandwidth, and supports HBM3—offering a domestic alternative as China accelerates efforts to localize its AI compute infrastructure. Tariff maze deepens: US duties on Chinese goods up to 245% amid policy whiplash The Trump administration has issued nine tariff updates since January 2025—nearly equaling the previous two years combined—creating chaos for Chinese exporters. While devices like smartphones and laptops received temporary relief at 20%, tariffs on key tech exports now reach 245% for EVs, 195% for silicon wafers, and 70% for semiconductors. The layered tariffs, drawn from both Biden-era and Trump's ongoing retaliatory measures, create a convoluted regime with rates ranging from 20% to 245%, not including extra global duties on EVs, steel, and aluminum. TSMC hikes 4nm pricing; US clients scramble under tariff pressure Trump's tariff push has driven Apple, Nvidia, and AMD to increase orders at TSMC's Arizona fab, despite a 30% price hike tied to limited 4nm capacity. TSMC is now producing Nvidia's Blackwell chips and AMD's fifth-generation EPYC processors, with a 2nm "Venice" chip also taped out. Output is capped at 20,000–30,000 wafers per month, intensifying competition. Nvidia's US-based production, backed by Foxconn, Wistron, and Amkor, could total US$500 billion over four years. Analysts expect second-quarter revenue at TSMC to climb nearly 10%. Nvidia's China strategy set back by new US ban on H20 chip The US has imposed an indefinite export ban on Nvidia's H20 AI chip, citing risks of its use in Chinese supercomputers. Nvidia responded with a US$5.5 billion charge tied to inventory and commitments, sending its stock down 5% in after-hours trading. The restrictions also apply to AMD's MI308 chip and threaten key Chinese deals, including orders from Alibaba, delivering a major blow to Nvidia's China strategy. TSMC, Foxconn, and Wistron join Nvidia's US$500B push to manufacture AI chips and servers in the US Nvidia plans to produce up to US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over four years, aligning with Trump's push for domestic manufacturing. Production of Blackwell chips has begun at TSMC's 4nm fab in Arizona, while Foxconn and Wistron prepare to build AI servers in Texas. Amkor and SPIL will manage packaging, establishing the first end-to-end US-based AI chip supply chain. Nvidia is targeting cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, set to spend US$371 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, with its US-based gigawatt-scale chip buildout. Trump hailed the initiative as a flagship success of his "America First" industrial policy. AMD advances US chip strategy with TSMC, joining Nvidia in massive domestic shift During her April 15 visit to Taiwan, AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed that wafer production has started at TSMC's Arizona fab, with mass production of fifth-generation EPYC chips underway. AMD also unveiled its MI350 AI chip, built on TSMC's 3nm node with CDNA 4 and HBM3E, claiming 1.2x efficiency over Nvidia's B200. As tariffs reshape the tech supply chain, AMD joins Nvidia and Apple in expanding US-based production. TSMC projects second-quarter revenue growth of 5–9%, though demand may soften later due to frontloaded orders. Micron reportedly secures Nvidia certification for fifth-gen 12-layer HBM3E supply Micron has reportedly secured Nvidia's certification for its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E and will supply it for the Blackwell Ultra (GB300) AI chip. With mass production underway, Micron aims to lead HBM3E shipments by late 2025. Currently holding 5% of the HBM market—compared to SK Hynix's 53% and Samsung's 42%—Micron's entry into Nvidia's supply chain could reshape the competitive landscape. Article edited by Jack Wu

Title: Tesla's biggest fan on Wall Street says Elon Musk faces a 'Code Red Situation'

One of the biggest Tesla (TSLA) bulls on Wall Street says it’s time for Elon Musk to change the narrative about his EV maker. With Tesla set to report earnings on Tuesday after the ball amid slumping sales and a cratering stock, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Musk’s latest “turnaround vision” must begin with Musk’s earnings call. Ticking off the slew of setbacks Tesla has faced this year — from becoming “a political symbol” and brand damage to “protests and violence against Tesla dealerships” and new tariffs — Ives said “we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.” “So why stay bullish? It’s a great question,” Ives wrote in a Sunday note. “We believe Tesla along with Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years. The unparalleled innovation, engineering scale, autonomous roadmap, and robotics future will unleash massive valuation upside over the coming years in our view. From earlier this year: Elon Musk is distracted. Tesla stock is cratering. Some investors want a change But Ives also said it’s time for Musk to leave his position in the Trump administration leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Wedbush said Musk faces a “Code Red Situation” if he stays at DOGE. “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,” Ives said. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing... spend some time speaking to car buyers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.” “We view this as a fork in the road time,” Ives wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage... but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Wedbush still maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla stock. The shares were down more than 5% in Monday morning trading, and have fallen almost 40% so far this year. Tesla is no longer selling the majority of electric cars registered in America’s biggest electric vehicle market. The automaker has lost significant ground in California, which accounts for almost a third of all zero-emission purchases in the country According to a publication sponsored by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), Tesla’s share of the state’s EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter of this year from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla registrations in the first quarter of 2025 fell over 15% from a year earlier — while registrations for all other EVs increased by 35%. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign and transitioned into becoming a senior White House adviser after Trump’s inauguration. He now leads DOGE, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs and enact other spending cuts, and has frequently weighed in on foreign politics. Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Many peaceful demonstrations have taken place, including a slew of protests held on Sunday, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. But more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. —Shannon Carroll and William Gavin contributed to this article.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Bhavish Aggarwal curbs ambition, seeks to raise $300mn for AI venture Krutrim

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Bhavish Aggarwal is looking to raise up to $300 million for his artificial intelligence venture Ola Krutrim, curtailing his ambitions to snag about $500 million, after seeing poor investor appetite, three people aware of the development said. While there are no concrete investment offers on the table yet for the next round, Krutrim, led by its founder Bhavish Aggarwal, is “confident of bringing multiple big-ticket investors to the cap-table" in the coming months, these people said on the condition of anonymity. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and SBI Capital Markets are the bankers involved in the funding round, one of the persons cited earlier said, adding that Krutrim will raise funds in a mix of debt and equity. The three banks did not respond to Mint’s emailed requests for comment. An Ola spokesperson said the company “does not comment on speculations." Mint could not independently ascertain the valuation being sought by Aggarwal for the latest funding round from investors. Read more: NRAI contests exclusion from CCI confidentiality ring in Zomato antitrust probe Matrix Partners, which initially led Krutrim's first $50-million funding round, is said to be contributing $25 million more in the upcoming round, the second person said. “The company is speaking with a number of top venture capital funds outside of India for additional capital—basing their pitch upon developing indigenous infrastructure and artificial intelligence models. No deal has matured yet," they said. The third person added that the company’s $500-million funding push “was a part of Aggarwal’s effort to complete the $1 billion fundraise before his deadline. That didn’t exactly work out." Aggarwal announced in February that Krutrim will attract investments amounting to over $1 billion by 2026. Krutrim, unveiled on 15 December 2023, is Aggarwal’s moonshot AI project that has claimed it will build foundational models for Indic languages, as well as India’s own graphic processing unit (GPU) chip, to make its own data centres and AI ecosystem. Krutrim is sanskrit for the word 'artificial'. On the 42nd day after the announcement, Aggarwal claimed to have raised $50 million for Krutrim at a valuation of $1 billion. On 4 February this year, Aggarwal claimed to have invested $230 million in Krutrim. This came after Aggarwal pledged about 8% of his shareholding in publicly-listed Ola Electric to raise debt to finance Krutrim's expansion. The funding round could be a key part of Ola’s claim to “make India independent of depending on Western companies for AI," as per Aggarwal’s statement on 15 August 2024. However, the company is yet to showcase the efficacy and veracity of its work at scale—something that investors and sectoral consultants said could be difficult. Read more: For the first time, India to make most of a laptop in-house “Ola is yet to release any peer-reviewed journal on its AI development, or showcase any product implementation at scale to build any kind of investor confidence. There are also major concerns that AI ventures do not necessarily need large funds as the cost of computing reduces, and India focuses on AI applications. Venture capitalists are also cautious as AI continues to change in terms of its fundamental nature, every few weeks. None of this would favour Ola’s push for a massive funding round," said Jayanth Kolla, partner at technology consulting firm Convergence Catalyst. Brain drain at KrutrimMeanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development. A senior industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said that Krutrim “is yet to show why it needs sweeping funds to build any AI patent close to being comparable with OpenAI, Meta or Google." “In fact, at this moment, multiple executives including senior ones have left the core Krutrim engineering team that is led by Sambit Sahu," the industry executive said. When contacted directly, Sahu did not respond to Mint’s request for an interview. To make matters worse, India’s investors are not convinced about signing on large cheques to the scale of Aggarwal’s demand. “The investors that can offer such large amounts in funding are all based outside of India. But, the large VCs are focused on personalities who stand out with a world-leading pedigree of AI storytelling and product development. For Aggarwal, this is more difficult to pull off since his core competencies are not in AI," said Kashyap Kompella, AI consultant and chief executive of RPA2AI. Kolla said that relying on SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son—who has backed Ola before—may be out of the question “since Son is focused on pooling in his funds for the US’ Stargate AI initiative." Read more: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is making big bets, leaning heavily on borrowing Such a move could hurt Ola’s efforts to achieve its funding goal. Kompella added that the current macroeconomic environment “is not going to help either." “At this moment, Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are causing widespread uncertainties—with the markets fluctuating wildly. When there is business uncertainty, the first thing that is hit is dealmaking. Large funding efforts will thus be only concentrated around a few executives such as Mira Murati (of the OpenAI founding team), who stand out as veterans in the global AI industry, and smaller ventures without a clear-cut sector expertise may struggle to raise massive funding rounds," Kompella emphasized. The fundraising attempt from external investors comes at a time when Ola Electric is facing concerns over profitability and regulatory practices. Currently, it is facing questions from the Union ministry of road transport and highways and Ministry of Heavy Industries over the gap in its sales and registration numbers in the month of February. The government is also questioning the company's servicing capacity after thousands of consumer complaints emerged against its flagship electric scooters. Since debuting at the public markets in August last year at ₹76, its stock has lost more than 30%. From its peak, the share price has lost over 65% value in the past 9 months. On Thursday, Ola Electric's stock closed little changed at ₹50.24 on the BSE. (With Inputs from Sneha Shah) Meanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development.

70% third-party goods are sourced from China … Key Points Detailed Analysis Stock Performance Amazon’s stock has declined significantly in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a 27.03% drop from its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025 [MacroTrends]. Posts on X highlight a 5% dip linked to tariff concerns, with analysts slashing price targets due to uncertainty []. The tariffs exacerbate existing pressures like underperforming segments and slower AWS growth. Tariff Policy and Impact President Trump’s tariffs, escalated to 145% on Chinese imports (125% announced April 2025 + 20% fentanyl-related), target goods critical to Amazon’s e-commerce platform [][]. Morgan Stanley estimates 25% of Amazon’s first-party inventory costs and 71% of third-party sellers’ products originate from China, making Amazon highly exposed compared to peers [][]. The elimination of the de minimis exemption (effective May 2, 2025), which allowed tariff-free shipments under $800, further increases costs for low-value Chinese goods [][]. E-commerce Challenges Supply Chain Disruptions Amazon canceled some Chinese orders to limit tariff exposure, causing ripple effects for vendors [][]. Air freight congestion and potential customs delays (due to increased inspections post-de minimis) threaten stockouts, especially for Prime Day 2025 [][]. Sellers are exploring sourcing from Vietnam, India, or Mexico, but shifting supply chains is costly and slow [][]. Competitive Dynamics The tariffs level the playing field by raising costs for Chinese platforms like Temu and Shein, which relied on de minimis exemptions []. This could benefit Amazon’s U.S.-based sellers, but higher prices across platforms may dampen consumer demand, with some buyers already stockpiling goods []. Profit and Stock Outlook Despite e-commerce challenges, Amazon’s high-margin segments—AWS (13% YoY growth) and advertising ($17.3B in Q4 2024)—provide resilience. The Motley Fool argues tariffs won’t derail long-term profit growth, as e-commerce contributes only ~3% margins compared to 35% for ads/subscriptions []. This supports a bullish stock outlook, though short-term volatility persists due to tariff uncertainty. Table: Tariff Impact Summary Conclusion The 145% China tariffs significantly pressure Amazon’s e-commerce business, contributing to its 2025 stock decline through higher costs and supply chain disruptions. While Amazon mitigates impacts via strategic actions, price hikes or reduced sales loom. However, AWS and advertising profits bolster the stock’s long-term appeal, despite short-term tariff-driven volatility. Key Citations .

Title: Why is Amazon stock down so much

Time Published: 2025-04-20T23:57:27Z

Key Points Stock Performance Overview Amazon’s stock has faced a notable downturn in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a significant drop of 27.03% from its peak on February 4, 2025. This decline reflects broader challenges in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors, not unique to Amazon, but the company has seen recent gains evaporate. Analyst and Market Reactions Analyst actions, such as Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, may have contributed to the stock’s decline. This adjustment aligns with Wall Street’s “Strong Buy” consensus, but it suggests a cautious outlook that could affect investor sentiment. Business Segment Performance Certain business segments, particularly smart home devices, are lagging, potentially dragging down overall performance. While advertising revenue surged to $17.3 billion in Q4 2024, showing 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, this high-margin area hasn’t offset declines in other areas. Competitive Pressures Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing at 13% year-over-year, slower than competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud, risking market share loss before 2030. Additionally, increased competition in e-commerce post-COVID, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail, makes it harder for Amazon to achieve the high growth rates it once did, adding pressure on stock performance. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Amazon Stock Decline in 2025 Amazon’s stock has experienced a significant decline in 2025, with multiple factors contributing to its performance as of April 19, 2025. This analysis delves into the detailed reasons behind the downturn, drawing from recent financial reports and market analyses to provide a comprehensive overview. Stock Performance Metrics The stock has seen a year-to-date loss of nearly 20%, a stark contrast to its performance earlier in the year. From its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, it has dropped by 27.03%, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025, according to historical data from MacroTrends Amazon – 28 Year Stock Price History | AMZN | MacroTrends. This decline aligns with forecasts from Long Forecast, which predicted a -14.1% change for April 2025, with the stock closing at $165 from an opening of $192 AMAZON STOCK PRICE PREDICTION 2025, 2026, 2027-2029 – Long Forecast. Analyst Sentiment and Price Target Adjustments Analyst sentiment has played a role, with Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025, as noted in a report from 24/7 Wall St. Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Despite maintaining a “Buy” rating, this adjustment reflects a cautious outlook, potentially impacting investor confidence and contributing to the stock’s decline. Business Segment Performance Specific business segments have underperformed, notably smart home devices, which are lagging behind expectations. This segment’s struggles are highlighted in the 24/7 Wall St. report, suggesting it drags on overall company performance. Conversely, advertising revenue showed strength, reaching $17.3 billion in Q4 2024 with 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, but this hasn’t been sufficient to offset declines in other areas Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Competitive Landscape and Growth Challenges Amazon Web Services (AWS), a key revenue driver, is growing at 13% year-over-year, which is slower compared to competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud. This slower growth rate poses a risk of market share loss before 2030, as detailed in the 24/7 Wall St. analysis Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. In e-commerce, increased competition post-COVID has made growth more challenging, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail sales, making it harder to achieve the high growth rates seen a decade ago, further pressuring the stock. Market Context and Broader Trends The decline isn’t isolated to Amazon; it’s part of a broader tumult affecting tech and consumer discretionary stocks in 2025, as noted in the 24/7 Wall St. report. This context suggests macroeconomic factors and sector-wide challenges are also at play, though Amazon’s specific business issues amplify the impact.

April 20, 2025 17:34 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

More Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images) Many investors have bet against car rental company Hertz Global. But activist investor Bill Ackman has built a 19.8% stake in the company, according to an April 16 Pershing Square Capital regulatory filing, the Globe and Mail reported. Since April 15, Hertz stock – about 40% of the company’s shares are sold short, according to the Wall Street Journal – have surged 131%. Is now a great time to buy Hertz stock? Here are four reasons to steer clear of these shares: Hertz is pleased with Ackman’s investment. “I am humbled, and we should all feel encouraged by Bill Ackman’s comments and energized by the strong support shown by him,” Hertz CEO Gil West said in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters. Ackman warned investors to be wary of the stock even as he argued Hertz – which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and now has two business lines: renting vehicles and borrowing heavily to own vehicles -- is undervalued, noted the Globe And Mail. I requested a comment from Hertz and will update this post if I receive a response. On social media, Ackman – who has a large following among individual investors and owns a big stake in Uber – gave three reasons why shares of Hertz could be worth $30 per share by 2029, the Globe And Mail reported. These include the following: While Ackman is right about the industry structure being concentrated, his numbers appear high. Rather than 95% of the market, their combined market share is 83% – Enterprise (39%), Hertz (22%), and Avis/Budget (22%), according to Market.us. Also, I question how successful Hertz’s turnaround is and whether tariffs and the Uber/Hertz partnership will boost Hertz’s value. After hosting a revolving door of CEOs, Hertz has recently contracted unprofitably. Hertz entered bankruptcy in May 2020 and emerged on July 1, 2021, under Paul Stone’s leadership – "returning about $8 a share to stockholders in its exit from chapter 11," noted the Journal. Mark Fields, who served as interim CEO from October 5, 2021, made the decision for Hertz to order 100,000 Teslas. Despite TV ads from Tom Brady promoting the Tesla fleet, consumers did not take the bait, the Journal reported. Hertz’s operating costs rose and in February 2022 Fields was replaced by Goldman Sachs veteran Stephen Scherr who built up the EV fleet. In December 2022, Hertz took a "$168 million charge to settle 364 claims related to the company falsely reporting rental cars as stolen," according to CNN. On April 1, 2024, West – who was previously Delta Airlines chief operating officer -- replaced Scherr as CEO. West cut operating costs by selling a large portion of Hertz’s EV fleet and the associated remote charging network – taking a $200 million writedown, the Journal wrote. The EV blunder reduced Hertz’s earnings, and the company has reported net losses for the last couple of years – including quarterly losses for the most recent five quarters ending December 2024. Moreover, during that time the rental car company’s debt load has increased 6% to $18.3 billion, its equity has plunged 95% to $153 million, and its revenue fell 6% to about $2 billion in the final quarter of 2024, noted the Journal. Ackman sees tariffs boosting the value of Hertz’s fleet of used late-model vehicles. He als0 expects a partnership with Uber to increase the companies’ fleet utilization and profitability. He forecasts President Donald Trump’s 25% levy on imported automobiles will boost the value of Hertz’s 500,000 vehicles by 10% – increasing their value to $13.2 billion. Moreover, the “$1.2 billion gain on its auto assets is equivalent to approximately half of the company’s current market capitalization,” Ackman said in an X post featured by Bloomberg. Ackman’s 10% is at the high end of a range of used car price increase estimates. For example, one analyst expects used car prices to rise between a 5% and 10% in the near future, according to iSeeCars. Of course if that happens, I doubt Ackman expects Hertz to sell all 500,000 of those vehicles. So, as the company replaces older vehicles with new ones subject to tariffs, it is unclear how much of that $1.2 billion value increase the company will capture. Ackman is counting on West to boost Hertz’s stock price. Getting there would require the company to reach the CEO’s operating targets which include $1,500 in revenue per unit, around $30-per-vehicle operating expense, about $300 in depreciation per unit, and an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, Ackman noted on X. Ackman also floated the idea of Hertz managing a fleet of self-driving vehicles – in its 11,200 global locations – for Uber which is “excited to brainstorm on how we can expand on our relationship,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi posted on X. I question the realism of West’s operating targets. Many economists see tariffs causing an economic slowdown. If that happens, consumers and businesses could cut back on travel – thus lowering Hertz’s revenue per unit. Moreover, with tariffs raising the price of auto parts, vehicle operating expenses could go up rather than fall. Hertz faces other threats – notably a $272 million legal judgment from bondholders who claim the company should have paid them interest during its time in chapter 11. Hertz is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court. “While the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resumption of global travel rendered Hertz solvent despite the high stakes of this dispute, the nearly $272 million at issue here could make the difference between solvency and insolvency in many cases,” Hertz lawyers wrote in an April 4 petition to the high court featured in a Bloomberg report. Bondholders remain wary of Hertz’s junior bonds. They still trade “around 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,” the Journal reported. Hertz shares are way overvalued in the view of Wall Street. Four analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $2.93 – suggesting the rental car company stock is 181% over-valued. Short sellers may have contributed to this overvaluation by scrambling to repay the shares they borrowed – assuming some of them purchased the stock in a rising market following Ackman’s announcement of his 19.8% stake. I agree with Ackman’s concluding thoughts. “Investing is risky,” he wrote on X. “There are no guarantees of a successful outcome. Caveat emptor.” Consider avoiding Hertz stock.

Title: 5 Must-Haves In Your Morning Routine Guarantee Career Success

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. No matter how you start your early morning routines, if you want to be productive and successful, ... More career experts say you should include these five things. A recent TikTok video by @ashtonhallofficial went viral amassing a staggering 109.2 million views. The video showed the creator’s time-stamped morning routine, starting as early as three a.m. The video gained traction as viewers wonder how realistic the routine is for success. After seeing the video, career experts at resume.io decided to offer tips on how five must-haves in your morning routine guarantee career success and boost productivity throughout your workday. On some days, given the daily obstacles many of us face in our jobs, it can feel more productive to hit the alarm, roll over and go back to sleep--especially with threats of inflation, AI competition and massive layoffs. But then reality hits, reminding you that you have to future-proof your job so you don’t end up another statistic. But have you ever been curious about how the rich and famous, with less to lose, start their early mornings? The career experts at resume.io compiled the morning routines of successful CEO billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook to show they start their morning routines for continued successful workdays. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and worth $202 billion, awakens around 6:30 a.m., according to resume.io and enjoys a screen-free start to his workday. The career experts describe his mornings as slow with family breakfasts and journaling before bracing the workday. They conclude that Bezos’ slow and balanced morning routine proves that productivity doesn’t always require rushing. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is worth $188.1 billion. Career experts tell us that he starts his day at eight a.m., checking numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. “Zuckerberg is known for his minimalistic morning routine, including wearing the same style of outfit daily to avoid decision fatigue,” they note. “This habit is also synonymous with other successful people like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, worth $2.4 billion, is one of the earliest risers in the business world, according to the career experts. He starts his day between 3:45 a.m. “This may be what inspired TikTok creator @ashtonhallofficial to do the same,” the experts speculate. “Cook uses the early hours to get ahead on emails and current affairs. He also often completes a workout before 6 a.m. Cook credits his structured early starts with helping him stay focused throughout the workday.” You may have already realized that the difference in you and the billionaires is that they have the freedom of going to bed and getting up when they choose. Many of us in the workforce don’t have the luxury of when to hit the hay or awaken in the morning. But research informs us that routines and rituals help with self-regulation and job stress, contributing to productivity and career success. So, it’s important to consider a structured morning to get your workday off on the right foot. Amanda Augustine, career expert for resume.io, explains that you don’t need to wake up at 3 a.m. to be successful. She advises that the key to having a productive morning depends on three factors: consistency, balance and starting the day off on your own terms. Here are Augustine’s habits that can be integrated into a morning routine that guarantees career success. 1. Aim to wake up at a consistent time. “Try waking up around the same time each day to help regulate your body’s natural rhythm,” Augustine suggests. “Over time, your body will learn when it’s time to be alert, helping you avoid grogginess and feel more energized in the morning.” 2. Limit phone use for the first 30-60 minutes. “Resist the urge to jump into emails or scroll through social media—even if it’s what some famous CEOs swear by,” she advises. “Giving yourself some screen-free time in the morning can lower stress levels and help you start your day calmly and with intention, rather than reacting to the noise around you.” 3. Soak in some natural light. Augustine recommends exposing yourself to natural light within the first hour of waking up. “Whether it’s stepping outside or opening the blinds, this simple habit helps reset your internal clock, lifts your mood and supports better sleep at night.” 4. Move your body. “Incorporating movement into your morning—whether it’s stretching, walking or a quick workout—can get your blood flowing, improve your focus, and boost your mood for the rest of the day,” she points out. 5. Set your intentions for the day. “Take a few minutes each morning to jot down your top one-to-three priorities for the day.” According to Augustine, this helps bring clarity to your morning and ensures you’re starting with purpose instead of just jumping into the next thing. "Remember, the key is to build a morning routine that suits your lifestyle. This will make it easier to maintain and more effective in setting you up for long-term success,” she concludes. These five must-haves in your morning routine corroborate studies that show morning contemplation broadens your perspective and reverses negative thoughts such as self-doubt and uncertainty about the future. Whatever you plant in your mind in the early morning will continue to live and breathe within as you face the challenges in the workdays ahead.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally.
