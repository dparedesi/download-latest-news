ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The U.S. has always tied the success of its companies to the success of the country to some degree. Last week, President Donald Trump made a literal connection between the two, brokering a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. While there is precedent for the government taking a stake in private companies, it’s generally only happened in times of widely recognized crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. Treasury received stock warrants to prop up struggling commercial airlines—which were sold at an auction last year. During the Great Recession, the federal government purchased assets from failing banks to prevent a collapse of the financial system. And during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency during the Great Depression, the federal government provided financial support for banks, railroads and other companies in danger of collapse. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like the one with Intel. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick identified defense contractor Lockheed Martin as a potential recipient in a Tuesday morning interview with CNBC. This is only the latest example of Trump’s involvement in the business sector. In June, he allowed Nippon Steel’s merger with U.S. Steel to proceed by claiming a “golden share” in the business, giving the federal government special powers over how the U.S. part of the company is run. Last month, the Defense Department became the largest shareholder in rare earth mining company MP Materials. And a deal he made with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China came to light earlier this month. It’s clear that Trump does not follow a traditional governing playbook, but the administration’s heavier hand in business operations could impact both corporate bottom lines and the economy as a whole going forward. With other factors at play—including tariffs, interest rates, currency values and a potentially volatile stock market—the next three and a half years will be interesting for corporate finance. In today’s world, there are many things competing for the CFO’s attention, and it can be difficult to prioritize. I talked to Chris Sands, InvoiceCloud CFO, about how he drowns out the noise of everything else going on and harnesses the CFO’s ability to bring change to an organization. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. President Donald Trump has been very direct in his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which has held baseline interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% since December. But on Monday night, he took his boldest step against the Fed yet, sending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook a letter immediately firing her from her position. The letter, which Trump shared on his Truth Social platform, says that the president can remove governors for cause. Trump writes he believes Cook may have committed mortgage fraud, potentially making a false statement on a mortgage agreement. Cook has denied the accusation, and said in a statement shared with several news organizations that there is no cause under the law for her to be fired, and that the president has no authority to do so. She also said she will not resign, and will continue to serve out her term. Cook’s attorney Abbe Lowell said she will file a lawsuit challenging “this illegal action.” Experts say that Trump’s reasoning is legally dubious. Cook hasn’t been formally charged with a crime, hasn’t been given a chance to respond to accusations, and the alleged misconduct happened before Cook was confirmed to her Fed position, meaning the Senate and president could have vetted it during the advice and consent process. Previous Supreme Court rulings about firing members of independent boards found that they could only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Trump has been steadily attacking the Fed, and specifically Chairman Jerome Powell, since he took office. He reportedly weighed firing Powell outright, and is already searching for the person to succeed him when his term ends next year. Economists, scholars and critics told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s actions put the U.S. into “uncharted waters,” since the Federal Reserve was designed to regulate financial policy outside of politics. Stocks have been volatile since Trump’s announcement regarding Cook, but are roughly unchanged from Monday. The irony is that the current Fed Governing Board may be poised to give Trump the interest rate cut he wants. At the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week, Powell said, “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” According to CME FedWatch, 87.3% of economists predict a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next month. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 83% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. The wage gap between CEOs and workers at the 100 lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 widened nearly 13% between 2019 and 2024, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies. Starbucks had the largest gap—CEO Brian Niccol made $95.8 million last year, while the median pay for a worker was just $14,674. In the last five years, the report found that CEO pay at those companies increased 34.7%. Average median worker pay, on the other hand, was up just 16.3%. At 22 of those companies, median worker pay actually dropped since 2019. The report found that these wide salary gaps tend to widen gender and racial disparities at large, since many low wage workers are women and people of color, and few large companies have female or minority CEOs. There’s always a lot going on in today’s business world, and companies are counting on their CFOs to not only balance the books, but provide strategy to help them succeed going forward. Chris Sands, CFO at billing and payment solutions company InvoiceCloud, has focused on drowning out the noise that gets to the CFO’s office and concentrating on what’s the most important. I talked to him about how to find those functions and make sure that’s the work that a CFO does. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some things that today’s CFOs are getting wrapped up in that are adding unnecessary complexity to their jobs? Sands: Using AI today as an example, it’s a very topical, very important, powerful technology that has a lot of implications. We’re an AI-forward organization, and there’s pressure on all of our leaders across the different functional areas to figure out what the best AI use cases are, how to adopt that, how to deploy that. But when I think about finance, and the use cases that exist today, and the maturity of the solutions out there to address it and the opportunity, it is not necessarily the area where I think there’s the most bang for the bucks. I think about how I use my time as a CFO. Is it better spent trying to be way ahead of the curve on AI use cases in the finance function, or figure out where, broadly across the business, we can deploy AI to get the biggest bang for the buck in the overall return on the business? I think it’s the latter, using my purview from the org as well as the skillset that comes with finance and FP&A and the like to help the org figure out how to best deploy AI, as opposed to becoming too myopic. I’d say most of the things that come across the desk are important, and there’s value in doing them, but there’s a finite amount of hours in the day. It’s all about how do you understand what’s most impactful, and then prioritize accordingly and follow through on that. If you’re not super disciplined about understanding what the most important drivers of the business are, prioritizing them and making progress on those, you could easily slip into spending too much time with less-impactful things, and that’s overall going to be bad for the business. What should the CFO’s priorities be? There’s a CFO that can tell you what’s going on in the business, and that’s probably an okay person. There’s a person that can tell you what’s going on and what should happen in the business, and that’s pretty good. The top tier would be people that can tell you what needs to happen in the business, and then go make it happen. I strive to be the top one. To me, the most important part of the job is understanding how the business works and what matters for the business. Being not just the custodian of the finance function, financial statements, board reporting and all of that, but being kind-of like the chief analyst of the business. Understanding for each business what makes it tick? Where are the opportunities? And then how do you make improvements against where those opportunities are? It starts there from there as you determine what the top priorities are, what the potential impact on the business is. How do you kind of ruthlessly prioritize and say no to other things? I find that to be the hardest part of it, because there’s always demands from different angles on how to spend the time, and things that need to be done in the business. Oftentimes, the biggest, most strategic things that are potentially needle-moving for the business don’t have a firm timeline or pressure coming from the board, CEO or others, so it’s easy to deprioritize those—but that is to the detriment of the business. By relentlessly prioritizing and following up, you’re much more likely to make sure you’re spending your time in the right way. Once you’ve identified where the opportunities are and what the business needs to do, how do you actually become a change agent? I find that the storytelling piece is maybe the hardest for folks with the finance DNA, just because it’s a little more creative and not necessarily typical for the profile. But by crafting the narrative around what’s important for the business—how to do it—and winning over the hearts and minds of colleagues and board is how you start to influence change. How can a CFO put together a finance department that reinforces the focus that they need to have? Having folks that are grounded in what they need to do, good at what they do, probably gets you 80%, 90% of the way there. The way you set goals and motivate the org is incredibly important. Most organizations go through annual goal setting, but setting up a framework to set goals that are achievable will help in sticking with those through the year. I think it helps keep people grounded. If all of a sudden, you’re just reacting to everything that’s coming up, you’re doing folks a disservice. Something I see all the time, especially in the private equity landscape, is a request comes down from the board and the CFO says, ‘I got this request. I don’t fully understand what exactly they want it for or what they’re looking for, but boy, are we going to blow them away with the analysis we’re going to do.’ As opposed to having the ability to interact with the board or CEO in and say, ‘Help me understand what it is you want to get to and what you’re after, and I’ll help you figure out the best way to get there.’ I find that is a huge stress reliever on the finance org, who typically comes up with all of these things falling in their lap. It just creates a ton of churn in the org. Having the ability to understand what matters, not just for the business, but to your investors, what they’re after and what you’re able to do to help them get what they need. That’s the No. 1 piece of advice I give to first-time CFOs in the private equity setting: Build that relationship and dynamic with the board and investors, so you’re not unnecessarily burdening and taxing your org. It just is exhausting for everyone, and it deludes from the focus on things that actually matter more for the business. Financial software can be vital to your company’s operations, but it can also make things less efficient and more costly. Here’s how you can take a look at what you have and try to make it work best for your company. (And no, that doesn’t mean just add AI.) It doesn’t matter if you agree with President Trump that “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. They’re coming and will impact your business. If you’re a small business, here are three ways to prepare to keep your finances afloat as big changes are coming. This week, Keurig Dr Pepper announced its plans to acquire which beverage company?

Title: After Months of Calm, Nvidia Earnings Could Spark a Big Stock Market Move

All eyes are on Nvidia heading into the artificial intelligence chip giant's second-quarter earnings report, due after markets close later today. As the world's most valuable public company, Nvidia (NVDA) has more influence than any over the value of the S&P 500 and the more than $1 trillion indexed to it. With a market capitalization of about $4.4 trillion, Nvidia accounts for about 8% of the benchmark index, a whole percentage point more than its next largest component, Microsoft (MSFT). Nvidia's stock is expected to post its biggest post-earnings stock move in over a year, according to recent options pricing. That could translate into a market response that resembles that of a pivotal piece of economic data more than a single company's earnings report. Options data suggests traders expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.9% in either direction on Thursday, the first day of trading after Nvidia's report. The S&P 500 moved more than 0.9% on nearly a third of all trading days this year through Tuesday. But that figure is inflated by the tariff tumult that gripped markets in March and April, when the index jumped or fell by at least 1 percentage point on more than half of trading days. So far in the relatively calmer second half of the year, the index has moved more than 0.9% approximately one out of every 10 days. Nvidia's size isn't the only reason its earnings might move the whole market. It has also become an AI bellwether that can move the stocks of AI beneficiaries spanning a range of industries. The company's results, as a gauge of AI demand, exert significant influence over other semiconductor stocks. When Nvidia's results sent its shares plunging more than 8% in late February, the benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 6%, and not just because Nvidia accounts for about 9% of the index. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) tumbled more than 7% the same day, as did chip fabrication equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT). As the notion of what constitutes an "AI stock" has expanded, so has Nvidia's influence. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), nuclear power providers that have struck major data center deals with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), plunged more than 7% and 12%, respectively, following Nvidia's results in February. Server makers Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) saw their shares fall nearly 7% and 16%, respectively, while software provider Palantir (PLTR) slid 5%. The ripple effects of Nvidia's earnings could be even more pronounced now because AI beneficiaries and the "Magnificent Seven," after big gains this year, make up more of the S&P 500 than they did in February. Palantir has added roughly three-quarters of its value in the past 6 months, while Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained more than 50%. Broadcom, one of just nine U.S. companies worth more than $1 trillion, has climbed by more than a third in the same period. Before Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech sent stocks soaring last Friday, tech and AI stocks were having a rough week. Palantir last Wednesday notched its longest losing streak in more than a year. An ETF tracking the "Magnificent Seven" stocks slid 3.5% over the first four days of the week. Investor concerns about an AI bubble, which have repeatedly bubbled up over the past few years, resurfaced last week. Wall Street was unnerved by an MIT survey that found nearly all companies have seen no material benefits from their AI investments. And Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, reportedly said the prior week that investors had become “overexcited” about AI. Those headlines amplified worries that tech valuations had become stretched after a strong rebound off April's "Liberation Day" lows. The S&P 500 IT sector index has risen about 50% since bottoming out on April 8, far outpacing the 30% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent options and stock prices.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T16:57:44Z
Full Content:
ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund.

Title: Banking On Financials - 3 Undervalued Bank Stocks

ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. The banking sector has hardly been on a smooth ride in recent years. Between rate volatility, regulatory uncertainty and heightened investor skepticism following the regional banking crisis of 2023, many bank stocks remain deeply discounted relative to their long-term earnings power. Yet when I look at the numbers today, I see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about what lies ahead. A terrific signal of confidence came in June, when the Federal Reserve released its annual Stress Test results. Even under a hypothetical scenario of 10% unemployment, a 50% equity market decline, and steep drops in commercial and residential real estate prices, the nation’s largest banks maintained capital levels well above regulatory minimums. That resilience has allowed management teams to raise dividends and restart or continue share repurchases. Let’s take a closer look at three names I believe are especially well-positioned today: U.S. Bancorp (USB) - USB has long been known for its conservative credit culture and steady fee income from payments, wealth management and mortgage banking. After a tough stretch, earnings are expected to rebound meaningfully, with EPS projected to grow from $3.98 in 2024 to $5.16 in 2027. Shares currently trade for less than 11x the estimate for the next 12 months, among the lowest in the large-cap bank group, while they yield a healthy 4.2%. With its broad Midwest and Western footprint, and strong partnerships with State Farm and Edward Jones, I see USB as a quality franchise available at an attractive price. PNC Financial (PNC) - PNC has leaned into its “brilliantly boring” brand, and the numbers for the large regional bank back it up. After a flat 2024, EPS is forecast to climb 10% in 2025 and another 12% in 2026, reaching $19 by 2027. At less than 11x forward earnings, the stock looks inexpensive relative to that trajectory. The dividend yield of 3.4% provides additional support, and with capital levels robust, I wouldn’t be surprised to see stepped-up buybacks in the coming quarters. I’m also encouraged by new leadership, as the addition of former BlackRock executive Mark Wiedman signals a greater emphasis on wealth and asset management integration—areas that could lift growth further. Bank OZK (OZK) - Smaller in size but no less impressive in execution, Arkansas-based regional bank OZK continues to deliver industry-leading profitability, supported by its Real Estate Specialties Group and conservative underwriting discipline. Earnings are expected to grow steadily, from $6.04 in 2024 to nearly $7.00 in 2027. Even after a strong run from the April lows, shares trade for only 8x estimated earnings, a deep discount for a bank with peer-leading returns on equity. The dividend yield stands at 3.4% and has grown at a double-digit rate over the past five years. Despite exposure to Commercial and Industrial lending, OZK offers a combination of conservative underwriting and a cost-conscious culture, as long-tenured management has long stressed credit discipline and risk-adjusted returns. Across these three institutions, I see a compelling mix of earnings momentum, strong capital positions, disciplined management and valuations that remain appealing. Inexpensive forward P/E ratios that we think should be higher and generous dividend yields compensating investors for their patience make for a compelling combination. No doubt, challenges remain as credit costs could rise and the policy backdrop is never static, but the combination of strong fundamentals and modest valuations makes me believe these banks should be included in a diversified portfolio of undervalued stocks. ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/26/2025 9:35:10 AM PDT by Morgana President Donald Trump could not resist offering his opinion on the great Cracker Barrel rebrand debate, urging the iconic American restauranteur to capitalize on their negative publicity for maximum brand awareness. 'Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,' Trump said. Cracker Barrel ignited a firestorm of criticism on social media last week after it announced their decision to remove 'Uncle Hershel' from the company logo in favor of a more minimalist design. 'Uncle Herschel' is the real-life relative of the brand's founder Dan Evins. The old emblem showed him sitting on a chair in front of the famous cracker barrel. Republicans loudly protested the redesign, complaining it amounted to the abandonment of American values. Trump urged the company to leverage the controversy for maximum profits. 'They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,' he wrote. 'Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity.' He proposed that the company announce a major news conference to announce changes to the greatly criticized rebrand. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

While Pepsi had been beating them in the supermarkets, Coke completely dominated restaurant (both chains and diners, etc.) fountains, leaving Pepsi with those brands they owned at the time (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken). I am sure McDonald's pushed back on New Coke. That was a big deal, especially then before so many smaller competitors popped up in droves. 5 posted on 08/26/2025 9:40:46 AM PDT by Dr. Sivana ("Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye."

Who here thinks that ding bat CEO will listen to Trump's advice? Cracker Barrel is too mired in WOKE. Blackrock owns a major stake in the chain. They’ll never back down. The difference is Cracker Barrel’s business model is in big trouble. Sit down chain resstaurants serving real food are going extinct due to inflation and increased costs of business. In 1960 America I think the well established brands depended on a better advertising campaign to stir up product sales, they didn’t replace their well established brands, they just hired better advertising talent. If anyone knows anything about branding, it is Trump. They need Don Draper. If they get 30% of the customers to buy alcohol with their special at Chili’s, it’s a winner for them. Agree 100%. No way they ever go back to the old logo, or in any way acknowledge that they pissed off most of their customer base. After all, these are liberals/leftists/marxists we're talking about. I thought that Uncle Hershel WAS the Cracker sitting next to the Barrel. (’Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,’ PRESIDENT Trump said.) Exactly. Many of us are saying the same thing. Libs never admit they were wrong. I know exactly what to do: Let’s hire a self-hating, America-hating leftist yuppie Jew for a cool million per year! Voila!

Title: Rumored Ripple NDA Suggests Trump, BlackRock, And JP Morgan Are Working With XRP Ledger

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are spreading fast in the crypto world after a supposed leaked NDA linked Ripple to big names like Trump, BlackRock, and JPMorgan. According to a post by Stellar Rippler on X, the XRP Ledger may have ties to projects that connect digital identity, healthcare, and global settlement systems. At the same time, BlackRock’s new ETF, Trump’s healthcare policy moves, and JPMorgan’s focus on digital identity appear to fit into the same plan. The story began when an ex-banker using the alias @LordBelgrave claimed he had leaked one of Ripple’s NDAs with UBS. Most of the details were already in circulation, but one shocking part stood out, a reference to “Biometric Identity Mapping.” This idea points to technology connecting personal identity with global financial systems. It goes far beyond what many assumed Ripple was building. According to the leak, Ripple may be developing tools that link digital identity with payments despite CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s earlier warnings about government control. At the time, most thought he was only talking about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Healthcare already shows evidence of this. Wellgistics Health recently announced an XRP Ledger–based payment system that will serve 6,500 U.S. pharmacies. JPMorgan has already said that digital identity is the foundation of Web3. The World Economic Forum (WEF), describing how digital ID, compliance tracking, healthcare, and supply chains connect, promotes the same vision with its Blockchain Toolkit. Ripple’s involvement at high levels suggests it has a seat at the table. The leak looks even more critical when placed next to recent moves by global power players. BlackRock’s $XDNA ETF was launched on July 4th, the same day Trump pushed his “One Big Beautiful Bill” aimed at cutting healthcare costs. At the same time, Trump introduced his Digital Health Tech Ecosystem, while BlackRock’s ETF went live directly on the XRP Ledger. The timing makes it look like the moves are connected. JPMorgan continues to drive forward with digital identity projects that match what Ripple is building. Ripple’s DNA Protocol connects to healthcare, identity, and payments, and tries to bring these systems onto the blockchain. Ripple’s deals in Africa and the MENA region could not have happened randomly. Deals with Chipper Cash and Onafriq, plus DNA Protocol onboarding labs in African nations, show Ripple is not expanding randomly but appears to be using a targeted adoption strategy to spread the new system globally. Finally, photos of Brad Garlinghouse standing with leaders from the IMF, SWIFT, and Christine Lagarde raise a big question: was Ripple always meant to be the chosen rail for the coming identity-health-finance merger? The rumored NDA, combined with these strategic moves, leads many in the crypto world to believe the answer could be yes.

August 26, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: $25 for that? Consumers are going elsewhere for lunch.

Time Published: 2025-08-26T15:30:38Z

Good morning. Last night, US President Donald Trump said he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook "effective immediately." In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump said there was "sufficient reason" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements. In response, Cook said Trump has no authority to fire her and she will not resign. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, fast casual chains like Chipotle and Cava are losing their freshness. What's on deck: Markets: Why Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad won't save American Eagle's stock. Tech: A mix of AI FOMO and fear is sweeping Hollywood. Business: Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. But first, the rise and fall of the fast-casual slop bowl. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Let's grab lunch — my treat. Anywhere you want, as long as it's not Chipotle, Cava, or Sweetgreen. You expect me to pay $25 for … that? They've been dubbed "slop bowls," those mounds of vegetables, grains, and a protein or two. They were all the rage in the 2010s. Now, they could be why some fast casual chains are losing out, BI's Emily Stewart writes. The complaints are piling up: warm, weird salads; ingredients combined in the wrong way; portions so small, customers are filming employees just to try and get more food. And for the privilege? A price tag that makes you want to hurl. "Value is front of mind for nearly every consumer right now, and I think these restaurants just don't have a sharp enough value proposition," says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. So consumers appear to be going elsewhere, to places where, if they're spending that kind of money, they can sit down and get a better experience. Places that feel more affordable, more satisfying. Places like Chili's. Chili's has been on a hot streak. In its most recent earnings report, the CEO of Chili's parent company, Brinker, took a victory lap, declaring: "Chili's is officially back, baby back." The chain posted impressive sales growth, pushing Brinker's revenue past Wall Street's expectations to $1.46 billion. Alex Fasciano, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, noted that Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and The Cheesecake Factory have also had a strong year. Part of that growth may come from value-conscious diners tired of paying more for less. "Why am I paying $25 for a burrito and chips and guac when I could pay maybe a little bit more and have full service?" Fasciano says. With more of us heading back into the office, many are only just realising how expensive these slop bowls have gotten. What started as a slightly more expensive, healthier alternative to fast food now feels overpriced and underwhelming. As America's slop bowl moment fades, the next big thing might just be a full plate and a fair price. 1. Trump has bought $100 million in bonds since starting his second term. That's according to a new filing from the Office of Government Ethics. The president's bond purchases could stand to benefit if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, which Trump has been pressuring the central bank to do for months. 2. Behind Palantir's bad month. The tech titan's stock was flying high in 2025, reaching a record high in mid-August before shares fell 17%. Investors are feeling hesitant about Palantir's stock for three reasons, but optimism remains strong around its long-term trajectory. 3. Sydney Sweeney can't keep American Eagle's stock afloat. Bank of America analysts cut their rating on the stock to "underperform," citing the negative impact of tariffs. Any positive impact from Sweeney's jeans ad, including its rise to meme stock fame last month, will get canceled out, the firm said. 1. How Hollywood is using AI on the hush. Entertainment giants like Netflix and Lionsgate have recently touted their embrace of AI, but the tech still has a stigma among the creative community. Five Hollywood insiders told BI they dread being associated with AI, and those who are using it are doing so in secret. 2. Meta continues to poach AI talent for its superintelligence team. Meta has recruited at least 10 previously unreported researchers from Google's DeepMind since July, according to LinkedIn data reviewed by BI. The tech giant has also targeted Scale AI, with six of its AI researchers announcing their departures to join Meta in recent weeks. 3. OpenAI ramps up its healthcare push with a new hire. The company has tapped Doximity cofounder Nate Gross to lead its growing healthcare business. OpenAI aims to sell directly to healthcare customers rather than power other companies' products, reflecting a larger pivot: it wants to own not just foundation models, but AI infrastructure and applications, too. 1. Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. The popular dolls are on track to do $1 billion in sales this year, according to EMARKETER. And although they are no Beanie Babies, it's hard to imagine that Labubus will still be popular years from now, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 2. Burning Man kicks up business deals, too. Tech moguls, celebrities, and models flock to the Black Rock Desert every year for the Burning Man festival. But they do more than just party: Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, are among the leaders who have made key business decisions amid the dusty festivities. 3. Why this app's CEO will cancel a user's $25K subscription. Dorsia lets its users snag reservations at top restaurants for either $175, $5,175, or $25,175 a year. CEO Marc Lotenberg says he's kicked several users off the platform since its launch in 2022, and told BI "being rude to servers" is a bannable offense. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely access external data and tools. Let us delve into understanding how to secure Spring AI MCP Servers with OAuth2. Spring AI is an extension of the popular Spring Boot framework that allows developers to integrate large language models (LLMs) and AI capabilities directly into their applications. It simplifies building intelligent features such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and natural language understanding within Spring-based systems. OAuth2 is an open-standard authorization framework that allows applications to securely access resources on behalf of a user. In the context of Spring AI MCP servers, OAuth2 ensures that only authorized clients can interact with AI services, protecting sensitive data and AI endpoints. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications connect LLMs to data and tools, like how USB-C connects devices to peripherals. It enables building agents and complex workflows by linking models with the world. Learn more about MCP here. Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring applications. In the context of MCP servers, it ensures that only authorized clients can access AI model endpoints, protecting sensitive data and services. Key features of Spring Security for MCP servers: Using Spring Security, developers can: Overall, Spring Security provides the backbone for safely exposing AI model endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized clients can interact with the MCP server. Add these dependencies to your pom.xml: Define a controller that provides realistic stock data in MCP format. In production, you could fetch real stock data from APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. This Spring Boot controller, annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping("/stocks"), provides a simple API to fetch stock information. It stores stock symbols and their prices in an immutable Map called stockPrices. The @GetMapping("/{symbol}") method takes a stock symbol as a path variable, looks up the price, and if not found, throws a ResponseStatusException with a 404 status. If the stock exists, it creates a Map containing the symbol, price, currency (“USD”), company name (determined by the private getCompanyName method using a switch expression), and the current timestamp. The resulting map is returned as JSON when the API endpoint is called. Enable OAuth2 security for your MCP server: This Spring configuration class, annotated with @Configuration, sets up security for the application using Spring Security. It defines a SecurityFilterChain bean that customizes HTTP security. CSRF protection is disabled with csrf().disable() and CORS support is enabled using cors(). The configuration requires that any request to endpoints under /stocks/** must be authenticated. Finally, it configures the application as an OAuth2 resource server using JWT tokens (oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()), ensuring that only requests with valid JWTs can access the secured stock endpoints. To enable your MCP server to authenticate and authorize clients using OAuth2, you need to configure a client in application.properties. This configuration registers a client with the authorization server, specifying the client ID, secret, authentication method, and allowed grant types. With this configuration, your MCP server can request JWT tokens from the authorization server and include them in requests to secured endpoints. This setup ensures that only authorized clients can access your stock data API. For this tutorial, we will use Keycloak as the authorization server to register the client. The focus is on the MCP server, so Keycloak setup is not covered here. Note: Before configuring the OAuth2 client, you need to register your MCP server as a client in Keycloak. Create a new client, set the client ID (e.g., stocks-client), configure the client secret, and enable the client_credentials grant type. This allows your MCP server to obtain access tokens to secure its endpoints. After adding the dependencies, creating the controller, and configuring security, you can run your MCP server as a standard Spring Boot application. Use your IDE or execute mvn spring-boot:run from the command line in the project directory. Once the application starts, it will listen on the default port 8080. Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant: Use the token to query stock information. Please note localhost:8080 will act as the mcp.example.com. The server will return a JSON response like: Unauthorized requests will be rejected with a 401 error. This setup ensures that only authenticated clients can access stock data, making the MCP server production-ready and secure. We created a Stocks Info MCP Server with Spring AI and secured it using OAuth2. The server returns stock data only to authorized clients, ensuring secure access while keeping the setup simple and easy to use. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Yet, according to experts, this revolutionary potential raises profound concerns, from surgical risks and device failures to deeper ethical questions about identity, autonomy, data ownership, algorithmic bias, and accessibility. In August, Noland Arbaugh, the first recipient of a Neuralink brain implant, revealed the technology had transformed his life 18 months after surgery. Arbaugh was left paralysed below the shoulders following a swimming accident that dislocated two vertebrae, and underwent the procedure in 2024. The Neuralink chip in his brain connects over 1,000 electrodes to his neurons, reads and decodes his brain’s electrical signals, translating them into digital commands. Dr Anusheel Munshi, MD (PGI Chandigarh), DNB(Gold Medal), MNAMS, Principal Director and Head, Radiation Oncology, BLK MAX Hospital, New Delhi, explained that these devices can connect computers to brains and hold transformative potential for medicine, promising breakthroughs in treating neurological disorders like paralysis, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. By enabling direct communication between the brain and machines, they could restore lost functions and revolutionise neuroprosthetics. These devices can potentially increase human memory and intelligence by a quantum leap. “Neuralink’s claims are ambitious and increasingly realisable, being grounded in credible neuroscience research for decades, but far from being comprehensive. The company’s ‘Telepathy’ implant has already enabled participants to control computers and smartphones purely by thought. These are not just proof-of-concept demonstrations; patients like Arbaugh are reporting sustained, meaningful improvements in quality of life over many months,” Lakshay Sahni, the co-founder & CTO, Marbles Health, said. He continued that the human brain is too intricate for a “one-interface-fits-all” solution. While the technology can be revolutionary for conditions such as paralysis or locked-in syndrome, in disorders like depression, anxiety, addiction, and Alzheimer’s, the evidence remains speculative. With risk inherent in every neurosurgical implant, infection, scar tissue (gliosis), device malfunction, and the need for replacement surgeries are genuine medical concerns. Psychological risks include the possibility of a permanent brain implant altering a person’s sense of self or identity. Other ethical questions include algorithmic bias in decision-making, shared accountability for interventions, equitable access to such life-changing tools, and the long-term implications for human identity and autonomy. Alongside, non-invasive brain technologies are already available to several patients. The FDA has approved Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat depression, whereas transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) devices have been approved in India for various neuropsychiatric disorders. None of the methods requires surgery and can be safely offered in outpatient clinics, and in some cases, even at home. In India, several startups have efforts focused on non-invasive BCIs. Marbles Health is a medically approved startup for portable neuromodulation for psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and ADHD. These technologies are safer, more affordable, and scalable within the Indian healthcare system. Sid Das, the co-founder of eGenome, an AI-powered platform for analysing genomic data, shared that non-intrusive, AI-driven technologies like its own eGenome.ai can already reverse up to 99% of disorders by decoding biomarkers, predicting risks early, and guiding precision interventions tailored to each individual. “Unlike surgical interfaces, they are safer, scalable, and accessible, allowing for broad adoption without exposing patients to unnecessary risks. In cases where non-intrusive methods may not suffice, brain-computer interfaces such as Neuralink can still hold promise at the margins. But our priority is harnessing non-invasive, precision AI diagnostics to deliver personalised care at scale, striving for 100% curability,” he said. Alongside, Neuralink-related surgeries are a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars endeavour, and only a few in the U.S. currently have access to the technology. The timeline from discovery to an accessible standard of care is lengthy, and equitable access will likely pose an obstacle. On the other hand, non-invasive brain health devices that are portable, clinic-ready, and safe will remain the opening to accessibility for the next decade. The technology is still expensive and limited even in the U.S., so widespread adoption in India will take time. “Building another Neuralink in India faces hurdles like cost, infrastructure, investment, regulatory, talent gaps, and patient acceptance. While India is unlikely to see a “copycat Neuralink” soon, maybe it should not. The country is positioned to lead in scalable, non-invasive brain health technologies that can reach millions. Instead of replicating Neuralink’s invasive path, India’s opportunity may be to complement it, developing accessible, approved, non-invasive neurotech solutions,” the Marbles Health co-founder said.

Nvidia will report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Wall Street will be closely watching for signs that AI-chip demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon is staying strong. Investors will also be looking for updates on how Nvidia is faring in China. The earnings-release time is shortly after 4 p.m. ET, and its conference call with analysts will start around 5 p.m. Nvidia's stock was up 35% year-to-date through Tuesday's close, handily outpacing the S&P 500's 10% increase. In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: RKLB Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) has shown exceptional growth in 2025, with its stock climbing nearly 90% year-to-date. This surge has been driven by the company’s recent successful rocket launches and its ability to secure major new contracts, particularly related to its upcoming Neutron rocket program. But what could drive another sharp rally from current levels to targets above $85? The following analysis explores the main factors that could fuel such significant upside over the next three years. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – UNH Stock To $600? Rocket Lab’s revenue outlook points to substantial expansion. With last-twelve-month revenues of $504 million, the company could more than double its revenue base to around $1.2 billion by 2027. This growth is supported by several drivers: Rocket Lab’s valuation multiple highlights its trajectory. Trading at nearly 50 times trailing revenues, RKLB reflects the premium placed on high-growth space companies. Yet, multiple compression suggests strong upside: If revenues double in three years while the stock price holds steady, the revenue multiple would fall to 25x. Given the company’s growth and positioning, a more realistic scenario is a multiple near 35x by 2027. At that multiple applied to expected 2027 revenues above $1.2 billion, the implied share price is about $85—nearly 80% higher than today. This reflects Rocket Lab’s growth story and the valuation premium typically afforded to leading space firms. Several catalysts could accelerate Rocket Lab’s trajectory: Potential challenges could slow this trajectory: This analysis outlines an upside case for Rocket Lab based on its growth and positioning. While a move to $85+ offers attractive potential, investors must weigh these gains against real risks. The 2022 correction, when RKLB lost 83% of its value, underscored the volatility inherent in space investments. This bullish case depends on successful execution in Neutron development, contract wins, and global expansion. Investors should size positions carefully, recognizing both the large upside and the risks tied to this high-growth sector. As always, investing in just one or a few stocks carries risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a diversified collection of 30 stocks that has consistently beaten the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? Because HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with less risk, offering smoother performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. This reinforces the value of diversification, particularly when considering high-growth but volatile names like RKLB.

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Shimon Kogan unpacks the behavioral and economic dynamics behind token value, investor psychology, and the rise of meme coins in this special series on the “Future of Finance.” Itay Goldstein Itay Goldstein Listen to the podcast. What determines whether a cryptocurrency succeeds or fades into obscurity? In this episode, Wharton professor Itay Goldstein speaks with Shimon Kogan, adjunct associate professor of finance at Wharton and longtime instructor of Wharton’s fintech course, to explore the economic and behavioral forces behind token success. From network effects and user adoption to coordination challenges and the phenomenon of meme coins, this conversation dives into the mechanics of tokenomics and what drives value in the world of fintech. This discussion is part of a special series called “Future of Finance: The Rise of Crypto and Digital Money.” Listen to this episode on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. Itay Goldstein: Welcome everyone. This is the Future of Finance series. This is our second season, and we are talking about digital assets, cryptocurrencies, tokens, decentralized finance, and everything related to that space. I am Itay Goldstein, professor of finance here at Wharton, and I’m currently the chair of the finance department. We are going to devote this episode to thinking about the economics of tokenization. This is a term that is now known as tokenomics. We’re going to try to understand what are the fundamental forces that are driving the market for tokens and coins, and how these forces are different from some of the other markets, financial assets that we are used to and that we have been thinking about in the past. I have the perfect guest today to think about those issues. Shimon Kogan has been with us at Wharton for the last 10 years or so, teaching the fintech course. He was one of the first movers into the area of fintech when few places had fintech courses. He already designed one and came to teach it for us, and has been doing it since then with great success. He also worked on related issues in his own research, and we are going to talk about that as well. Welcome Shimon. It’s great to have you. Let’s dive right in and try to understand some of the terms that we are talking about. Can you help us understand, what do we think about when we think about tokens and coins? What are the common uses for them? How are they potentially going to change the financial system? A lot of it is maybe just a pipe dream, things that we are aspiring to but have not been realized yet. How much is real and how much is still just a fantasy? Shimon Kogan: I’ll try to deliver on that, at least at a high level, because I’m sure that we’re going to dive into some of the more specifics during the conversation. But the top is a good place to start because there are lots of terms in this field and it gets quite confusing. In the world of crypto, I think it’s important to distinguish between different class of assets, because it tells you something about the underlying technology and the underlying structure. At the core level, we have cryptocurrencies. And each of these cryptocurrencies is associated with a particular blockchain. [For example,] bitcoin is the blockchain protocol. BTC is the native currency for that. Here as well, I think it’s helpful to distinguish between transactional only blockchains like bitcoin or litecoin, where the primary use case of the coin, aside for paying for the security, but the primary use case in these kinds of blockchains is payments. We want to separate that from the second generation, if you will, of blockchains, and those are programmable blockchains like ethereum, solana, and many other competitors where the primary use case of the native digital coin is to pay for the execution of smart contracts. So, we have cryptocurrencies as the main type of asset. Now, notice that when we talk about cryptocurrencies, because each of them is native to its own blockchain, you cannot take bitcoin and transact in ethereum and vice versa without some third-party offering, kind of like bridge services. We can talk about that if you’re interested. Now, on programmable blockchains, there are lots of things you can do. As it turns out, you can create tokens. We want to distinguish between, again, the cryptocurrency like ethereum and tokens that live on ethereum. These are assets that are created by applications around various use cases. Some of them could be payments for services, could be voting, could be control. We’ll come back to when we talk about tokenomics. The fact that this sort of Turing complete programming language means that you can create lots and lots of different varieties of contracts, and we see that in practice. That also introduces vulnerability. Many of my examples are going to be from ethereum because it’s simply the largest programmable blockchain. They created templates of types of tokens just to make developer’s life easier, so you don’t have to figure out from scratch all the features and open yourself up to security vulnerabilities. You may be familiar with ERC-20, which is the fungible token standard that was behind the ICO boom, or heavily used during the ICO boom. We have ERC-721 tokens. That’s the template oftentimes used in nonfungible tokens. More recently, we have ERC-1400, which now advances as a format to offer tokenization of off-chain assets. Again, we have cryptocurrencies and we have tokens. Now, those tokens inherent the security of the blockchain on which they were developed. So as a developer, you have to ask yourself where you want to develop your application and where these tokens are going to live. Because, again, they don’t port from one protocol to another. Naturally, there’s a lot of competition around kind of eyeballs and attention of developers by these, what we call layer ones, by these programmable blockchains. Goldstein: But if you want to think about the main economic uses for them, how would you classify that? Kogan: The first is, and that’s a very specific type of token, but it’s so specific that has its own name, and those are stablecoins, right? Stablecoins are tokens that are designed to keep a peg to, typically, the U.S. dollar, but could be, in principle, anything. It’s a big business. Circle went public, went from like $30 to $200 overnight. It’s a real big business. There’s another big business around and some real traction around tokenization, because that’s the idea of representing non-crypto native assets on crypto infrastructure, blockchain infrastructure. BlackRock, for example, partnered with Securitize to offer its money market fund, Biddle. That was the relative success. Goldstein: What you’re saying is taking financial assets and putting them on token. What is the advantage of doing that? Kogan: There could be few advantages. First of all, what you get is instantaneous settlement. Even if you’re an institutional player, once you have stablecoins and you have these crypto-native securities, or representation of them, then you have 24/7 instantaneous settlement, which we still don’t have even if you’re a large sort of corporation. If you’re moving money about a settlement, it takes time, depending on what kind of asset you’re looking at. But obviously, the ambition is much bigger than that. RobinHood announced that they’re going to offer tokens associated with private equity. So, they’re going to take, I don’t know, SpaceX, and OpenAI, etc., and represent them as tokens. People are talking about what’s called tokenizing real-world assets. Those are not securities at all. This could be anything from collectibles to real estate. Goldstein: It allows us to trade on things that otherwise we wouldn’t be able to trade. And things that we could trade, it allows us to do it more efficiently? Kogan: That’s right. Look, this is not a [panacea]. I have a lot of conversations with people in the industry about this. I think [there are] the parts of it that makes sense, [and] the parts of it that people are not thinking carefully through. Like, for example, there are fundamental reasons why some of these assets are illiquid. That illiquidity I don’t think is going to go away by creating a digital representation and offering people to trade it 24/7. That’s not a solution to the fundamental problem that causes these assets to be non-tradable. I’ll take the other side of this, but you can take assets that have a fairly infrequent price discovery, and you’re still not going to solve the problem of that price being stale. Again, this is not a fiction, this is happening. You can allow owners of these assets to pledge them as collateral, and that could be a partial solution for the liquidity problem. I have an asset that you have a hard time valuing, and you’re saying, “Look, I don’t know if it’s worth $80 or $90 or $100, but the probability that it’s worth less than $20 is very low. If you lock this asset in a smart contract, I’ll lend you $20 against this, with appropriate interest.” I think it’s an interesting solution of — kind of indirect way of giving some liquidity and by making these assets, at the very least, legible. Goldstein: When we are thinking about tokenomics, the economics of tokens, we would like to understand supply, demand, how prices are formed. If we are thinking about other financial assets, like stocks, I think we have very well-established frameworks. You’re thinking about future earnings, future cash flows, you’re discounting them, and so on. Those rules are not working exactly like that when it comes to tokens, and this is what makes the economics a little richer and more interesting. What do you think are the other forces, and how should we think about the economics here? Kogan: It’s a good question. First of all, let me say that it should be obvious from our channel so far that this flexibility allows us to create all sorts of tokens with lots of different features. I think one of the challenges of this industry is that there’s very little theory and not that much of an empirical work from academia to guide, say, new platform builders for how do their structure. They often come and ask these questions like, “How should I control supply? What is the emission rate, burn rate?” Basically, the dimensions along which they have choices are quite broad. I think that there’s more that we don’t understand about optimal contract design, if you will, in the context of tokenomics than we do. That’s my personal opinion on this. Now, I think it’s helpful to draw parallels to equities. There are some similarities and some differences. They look a little bit like each other because both, under some circumstances, give you some control rights and ownership rights, and some of them, although they don’t declare that, give you some cash flow rights. But let’s understand what world each of these live in. In the world of securities or equities, essentially what you have is a legal structure that safeguards the holders of securities against exposed bad behavior by managers or controls. Obviously, you do not have that legal protection when it comes to tokens, at least not under the current legal framework. What you do have with tokens is the ability to what we call pre-commit. What you can do, for example, with tokens, that you cannot do with equities, is to say, “I’m going to program in the rate by which new tokens are going to be issued, and it’s going to be a function of these conditions.” Take bitcoin, for example. It’s purely a condition. Like, it’s function of time, right? The price of bitcoin doesn’t affect the mission of bitcoin, how many miners there are. They don’t matter. That’s a particular choice that you can do in crypto world that you cannot easily implement with equities. Goldstein: This leads me to something related that people would think maybe is on the fringe but is getting a lot of attention, which is meme coins. You have coins that are kind of based on nothing. If you think about dogecoin or shiba inu, others, you basically have a token that has value just because other people think it has value and not because it represents anything that is underlying it that would be valuable. Would you think about that also using the same framework, or do you think this is something completely different? Kogan: I think that’s a good question. If you want to be provocative, you can ask whether bitcoin is a meme coin as well, right? Goldstein: Do you think that bitcoin is a meme coin? Kogan: No, I personally don’t, but — Goldstein: No, because at least with bitcoin, at the beginning, there was this idea that it’s going to be a new currency people are going to use it to buy things, and so on. I don’t think it really panned out this way so far, but there were some use cases. Kogan: Absolutely. I’m not suggesting that bitcoin is meme coin. All I’m saying is that if you take a few steps back and look from high-level perspective, you can ask yourself, what is the tangible utility? You’re absolutely right. By the way, with some of the meme coins, the process was kind of fake-it-until-you-make-it, in some sense. I don’t think it was designed. But, dogecoin now, Elon Musk is suggesting that it’s going to be the payment rail maybe for X. You have now kind of a mini-ecosystem around shiba inu. Again, I don’t think it was there in the first place. And I do think that there’s a lot of other factors at play here that are more coming from behavioral finance than anything else, in terms of thinking about valuation. I do want to mention something that we found, that I think is relevant for this discussion, in a paper where we had access to a really interesting dataset from eToro. EToro is a publicly traded company. It’s basically a retail broker that has operations in over 100 markets. One of the neat features of eToro is that from the get-go they offered retail investors the ability to invest in lots of different types of assets. They were one of the first to actually embrace crypto. The question we asked was really simple. Do people seem to behave different in cryptos than in, say, equities or gold? We wanted to ask that very simple question. More specifically, what we’re interested in is how expectations of future returns of these asset classes actually respond to prices, which is kind of what you’re getting at, right? Under some assumptions, what we can do is back out the share in the portfolio for users dedicated to each of these asset classes, and you can estimate how these portfolio shares respond to past returns. Very robust finding, right? Lots of different specifications. We find that when you look at equities and people have retail investors, in our sample, have contrarian beliefs. Equity prices go up, people believe that future returns are going to be lower than they were before. By the way, that’s true for gold as well, but not for crypto. So, they appear to have kind of momentum, like beliefs in crypto, and we try to understand where it’s coming from. For example, we looked at whether people have momentum beliefs when you focus on lottery-like stocks, those are stocks that have positive skewness. Maybe young stocks, smaller ones. There are various known proxies for this. And interestingly, we don’t find that. We still find contrarian beliefs, even in these lottery-like stocks. So, there’s something specific about crypto. Goldstein: This is the role of adoption and coordination, I think. This speaks very clearly to that. You say this can also support meme coins that might not have any underlying value, but the value is just coming from the fact that others are using it? Kogan: That’s true, although I think that with meme coins it’s a very extreme case because there’s not even a pretense. I think it’s for regulatory reasons, right? Part of it, I think, started as a way of avoiding being classified as a security. There’s no pretense of anything underpinning its value. It’s a very kind of extreme case of not where we push fundamentals to the future, where we have no fundamentals at all. There are some really interesting studies done in the ‘70s and ’80s looking at experimental markets where they tried to do this. They tried to see what happens when you push fundamentals further out into the future, and they found two things that could be actually relevant for these markets. They found that, first of all, you can create these bubbles in a lab, in a very controlled, very simple environment, in a reputable way. They found that expectations are adaptive. When these bubbles happen and you ask traders what they think the price is going to happen, many of them understand that prices get detached from fundamentals. But these fundamentals are not going to show up until later in the future, so they exhibit these adaptive expectations. The second thing is that they underestimate how quickly the bubble will burst, on average. Because it’s clear that, because there’s something anchoring prices. Goldstein: There is some parallel also to meme stocks, right? In the previous season, I talked to Matt Levine about meme stocks and social behavior in the financial market, and clearly that is a very strong force here as well. Maybe even more extreme, because with meme stocks, there is a grain of fundamental, whereas here there isn’t. These are maybe the same underlying forces, bit even more extreme that we see them here in tokenomics. Kogan: I agree. With GameStop, AMC, you would think that at some point there are fundamentals that are going to anchor the price of a stock with meme coins. It’s not obvious what that anchor is. I think they really lean on similar drivers for users, this sense of community, shared narrative, in some cases, this idea that they are collectively rebelling against traditional powers. I think that’s very important to note as well, and we see this elsewhere. There’s a great appetite for gambling. Goldstein: I want to go back a little bit to ICO, initial coin offerings. A few years ago, there was a wave of ICOs, and I think at that point there was hope that there is real economic value behind it. Because those are firms that, instead of issuing equity, they are issuing coins, and that is a way to raise capital and also supports the products of the firms. But unfortunately, there was also a lot of fraud associated with that, and then it came to halt. Now, there’s a lot of regulatory uncertainty where it’s going to go. Where do you think we are headed with that? You think there is still a future for this? Kogan: I very much agree with your assessment, but I also want to point out that there are some legitimate platforms that were built around that. Goldstein: Yeah, absolutely. There were some of them that were certainly legitimate, but there was also a lot of fraudulent ones around them. And the fact that it was hard to tell which is which, I think this is what caused the crash in activity. Kogan: I agree. It was sort of combination of that. And it kind of coincided, roughly around the same time, with the Terra Luna debacle, the FTX, Celsius. There are a bunch of notable cases of what you would legally or otherwise probably classify as fraud. That led to an obvious response by the regulator, the SEC. I think the regulatory environment now looks very different in the U.S., and I think that’s worth mentioning, and I think there’s hope that under that new framework there will be ways in which you can actually do this with proper disclosure and guidelines and consumer protection. That’s what we’re concerned about. The audience may be familiar with the GENIUS Act, which is standing for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin Act. It’s basically a framework for, how do you issue payment stablecoins, etc.? Again, I’m happy to talk more about that if you’re interested. And there’s another, even more ambitious and broader attempt to clarify what is a security, what is a commodity — under the Clarity Act — and provide safe harbor to developers, and establish market rules, and compliance rules, etc. These two may get combined eventually, and that’s part of the political discussion that’s taking place right now. We see very different frameworks slightly, but we see Europe being a bit ahead of the U.S. in that way through MiCA framework. It doesn’t cover everything, but it’s quite comprehensive and talks about guidelines for how you issue tokens and stable coins, and what custody services look like, etc. I think that, yes, in the U.S. — I think everywhere, right? We’ve seen some regulatory lag, because the industry moves very, very quickly. It’s fascinating to see how quickly the evolution cycles in this industry are. There are some legitimate issues around that, or concerns around regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage. I work as an expert witness for a number of crypto-related cases, and I see how the level of understanding on the supervisory and regulatory side, it’s very different from what it was a few years ago. There’s catching up to do, but I’m hopeful that it’s happening, and I think that this can actually lead to, at least from an entrepreneur’s perspective, a more sensible framework that’s based on activity and not based on type of institution.

Title: Can ADA rally to $1.20 despite SEC’s latest Cardano ETF delay?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/can-ada-rally-to-1-20-despite-secs-latest-cardano-etf-delay/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T13:00:19Z
Full Content:
Will Cardano, XRP, and PENGU ETFs finally break through, or stay trapped in regulatory limbo? The SEC has postponed its review of the Cardano ETF until the 26th of October, extending delays on multiple altcoin products. ADA, XRP, and PENGU continue to feel the pressure of regulatory delays. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again paused its review of the proposed Cardano [ADA] exchange-traded fund (ETF). It extended the decision deadline from the 27th of August to the 26th of October 2025. The move adds Cardano to the growing roster of altcoin ETF applications facing regulatory delays, as the agency continues to take a cautious approach toward approving new crypto investment products. If approved, the Cardano ETF would allow investors to access ADA through a regulated vehicle, eliminating the need to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The SEC’s latest delay has fueled speculation about how an eventual approval or denial could shape Cardano’s market trajectory. In fact, BlackRock has not yet sought a Cardano ETF; its existing Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] products have already attracted billions in inflows and lifted market prices. If BlackRock pursued an ADA-backed product, the token could rally toward $1.20, based on Fibonacci extension levels. For Cardano, the outcome of this review carried significant weight. A greenlight would mark a major step in boosting ADA’s accessibility for mainstream investors through traditional brokerages. On top of that, growing institutional recognition is already evident, with Cardano recently climbing in Grayscale’s asset rankings. By contrast, a rejection would be a setback for Grayscale and other firms seeking regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The SEC emphasized that the extension is intended to provide more time for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal, echoing its cautious stance toward other crypto-related applications. Needless to say, this is not an isolated case. Alongside Cardano, the regulator has also delayed its decisions on the Canary PENGU and WisdomTree Ripple [XRP] ETFs, both of which are now slated for a ruling by the 12th of October. By then, the SEC must either approve, reject, or initiate formal disapproval proceedings. The ripple effects of the SEC’s cautious stance are already being felt in the market. ADA slipped 5.15% to $0.8389, XRP dropped 1.73% to $2.91, and PENGU fell 5.59% to $0.03054 over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s August 2025 legal win cleared the way for new spot ETF filings from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Still, the path forward remained uncertain. Under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and with crypto laws on the horizon, optimism for approval rose. Yet risks remained.

August 26, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced leading global enterprises have adopted NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers — a new category of enterprise data center infrastructure powered by the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU — speeding the shift from general-purpose computing clusters to AI factory infrastructure, without a complete data center overhaul. Disney, Foxconn, Hitachi Ltd., Hyundai Motor Group, Lilly, SAP and TSMC are among the first to adopt the servers to accelerate AI, design and simulation applications. “The age of AI has arrived — and enterprises can no longer rely on classical servers alone. They must rearchitect for AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA RTX PRO is the computing platform built for this moment — running today’s IT workloads while powering the AI agents that will transform every company and every industry.” Industry Leaders Tap RTX PRO for AI Acceleration Built with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, RTX PRO Servers use the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture to deliver universal acceleration for demanding enterprise AI workloads spanning agentic and physical AI to advanced design, scientific computing, simulation, graphics and video applications. Industry leaders are deploying RTX PRO Servers to speed their enterprise workloads: Leading companies at the forefront of the AI industrial revolution are building AI factories and transforming their data center infrastructure with RTX PRO Servers. In manufacturing, leaders like PEGATRON, Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT), Siemens and Wistron are using these systems to drive factory automation and simulation. Digital advertising company PubMatic is using RTX PRO Servers to address new AI use cases and high-growth areas like connected TV, commerce media networks and mobile apps. Aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman is enhancing its existing capabilities with these systems to accelerate AI integration into enterprise workstreams to boost productivity and performance. Amdocs, a leading provider of software and services for communications and media companies, is deploying RTX PRO Servers to support the reasoning of its amAIz Agents for transforming telecom customer experiences. Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys will use RTX PRO Servers to accelerate Al-driven simulation across silicon, systems and AI. RTX PRO Servers Accelerate Workloads With Data Center Flexibility RTX PRO Servers accelerate agentic AI and reasoning workloads, allowing researchers and developers to build and deploy autonomous systems that can learn from, adapt to and interact with their surroundings in real time. For example, the NVIDIA Llama Nemotron Super reasoning model delivers up to 3x better price performance when running with NVFP4 on a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 GPU compared with FP8 on NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This enables more accurate reasoning at a lower cost. To develop effective physical AI systems, enterprises need to test and optimize their robotic fleets in simulation before deploying to real-world factories. NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers are advancing industrial and physical AI by delivering up to 4x faster performance for digital twin, simulation and synthetic data generation workflows than systems with NVIDIA L40S GPUs. RTX PRO Servers are designed for maximum flexibility to support Windows, Linux and leading hypervisors to offer IT managers a familiar environment for deploying AI at scale without compromise. These servers run virtually every enterprise workload — using air-cooled, PCIe-based, x86 architectures — all with enterprise-grade security, manageability and serviceability. Comprehensive Software SupportNVIDIA RTX PRO Servers and the entire Blackwell architecture product portfolio are supported by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and AI frameworks, libraries and tools that enterprises can deploy on NVIDIA-accelerated clouds, data centers and workstations. RTX PRO Servers are featured in the NVIDIA Enterprise AI Factory validated design for companies looking to build and deploy on-premises AI factories and in the NVIDIA AI Data Platform, a customizable reference design for building modern storage systems for enterprise agentic AI. For physical and industrial AI, RTX PRO Servers running NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models enable physical AI developers to build and deploy applications including digital twins for factory and robot simulation or large-scale synthetic data generation. AvailabilityNVIDIA RTX PRO Servers are available in multiple configurations with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs from Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro, as well as Advantech, Aetina, Aivres, ASRock Rack, ASUS, Compal, Eviden, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, MiTAC Computing, MSI, PEGATRON, QCT, Wistron and Wiwynn. Cloud service providers CoreWeave and Google Cloud are now offering instances accelerated by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, with additional instances coming later this year from AWS, Nebius and Vultr.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States ended a difficult run of redemptions with their first day of inflows in more than a week. According to Coinperps data, the products collectively drew $219 million on Aug. 25, marking a shift in investor sentiment after six consecutive trading sessions of withdrawals. This rebound was led by Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark 21Shares, which each attracted over $60 million. Fidelity’s FBTC logged the largest daily intake at $65.6 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $63.4 million and Ark’s ARKB with $61.2 million. Smaller allocations flowed into Bitwise’s BITB ($15.2 million), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ($7.3 million), and VanEck’s HODL ($6.3 million). Meanwhile, ETFs offered by Invesco, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton registered no new capital on the day. The return of positive flows comes after a bruising stretch in mid-August. Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 22, the group of funds shed roughly $1.2 billion, reflecting a wave of profit-taking and caution among institutional holders. So, this reversal suggests that some investors are seeing renewed opportunity in Bitcoin despite its recent loss of momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum products continued to overshadow Bitcoin ETFs in terms of investor demand. On the same day, spot Ethereum ETFs attracted $443.9 million in net inflows, more than double their BTC counterparts’ total. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $314.9 million, while Fidelity’s FETH drew $87.4 million. Smaller contributions came from Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and offerings by Bitwise, 21Shares, and Invesco, adding about $17 million together. The strong showing follows a turbulent prior week when Ethereum ETFs saw outflows equivalent to 105,000 ETH, breaking a multi-week streak of steady demand. Glassnode data indicates that the tide has turned again, with institutions adding back 16,900 ETH at the start of this week. The split in flows highlights how investor positioning is evolving in the current market conditions. Bitcoin ETFs are showing early signs of stabilization after heavy redemptions, while Ethereum funds are attracting stronger conviction in the short term. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

August 26, 2025 08:11 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: Is Passive Investing Creating A Bubble?

ByWes Moss, Contributor. Is one of the most popular investing strategies quietly distorting the stock market? As index funds attract trillions, several outlets—including Barron’s and Harper’s Magazine—have voiced concern that a passive investing bubble could be forming. The core argument is that too much money is chasing too few stocks. Passive investing—through index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—has become so dominant that it funnels an enormous volume of investor capital into a shrinking pool of mega-cap names such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, for example, which often sit at the top of major index fund holdings. Because these funds are market-cap weighted, larger stocks attract proportionally more capital. That can create a feedback loop, where rising stock prices trigger more buying, which in turn pushes prices higher. Critics, such as Michael Green of Simplify Asset Management, warn that this dynamic may warp prices and inflate a bubble that could burst if flows reverse. They also worry that because index funds are essentially buy-and-hold vehicles, they don’t actively contribute to price discovery—the process that determines what a stock is truly worth based on supply and demand. Yet others push back. Steve Johnson at Financial Times, for instance, notes new research suggesting the “…surge in passive money has made equity markets more efficient, contradicting some previous research that has found the opposite.” Zooming out provides more perspective. According to Boston Consulting Group, global assets under management (AUM) hit $128 trillion by the end of 2024. Passive strategies grew to 20% of total global AUM by the end of 2024. There’s no doubt these figures are substantial, but they are far from overwhelming. While recent estimates indicate that systematic and passive strategies combined make up more than 60% of daily U.S. equity trading volume, pure passive index-tracking flows appear to represent a much smaller portion. In Q1 2023, ETFs—including both passive and active funds—comprised 32% of U.S. equity trading volume, according to the ICI 2024 Fact Book (p. 61). Even at the end of 2023, passive index-tracking mutual funds and ETFs accounted for just 18% of total U.S. stock market ownership—a figure that may rise to 30–35% when including other passive strategies—keeping in mind that while ownership data helps gauge influence, it doesn’t directly reflect how often positions are traded. This highlights a key point: truly passive flows are only a subset of ETF activity and likely make up a modest portion of total market turnover. Passive investing began gaining traction in 1976, when Vanguard founder Jack Bogle launched the first retail index mutual fund. Since then, index-based strategies have become a cornerstone of modern portfolio construction. By offering typically lower costs, broad market exposure, and built-in diversification, passive investing has attracted significant inflows from investors seeking long-term, market-matching performance. And despite concerns to the contrary, price discovery still occurs. Even when passive holds a sizable chunk of assets, active traders can still dictate equity and bond values. Hedge funds, portfolio managers, and individual investors continue to trade billions of dollars daily based on earnings reports, valuations, and other market signals. This activity helps play a critical role in maintaining market efficiency. Morningstar's March 2024 U.S. Active/Passive Barometer analyzed over 9,000 unique U.S. funds representing $23 trillion in assets—about 68% of the U.S. fund market. Yes, passive funds have attracted more inflows for nine straight years, but active funds still account for more than half of total U.S. assets. So, while passive investing is significant—and growing—it doesn’t appear to be the all-consuming force some critics make it out to be. Regardless of the rise in passive allocation, active investing is anticipated to continue playing a vital role for many reasons. Individuals pursue hands-on strategies in an attempt to beat the market, to invest in their values, to take activist positions, or even because they think they can outsmart their peers. In short, investors generally do continue to care about their money, suggesting active management is likely to remain relevant. The real surprise? Active managers outperformed passive funds far more often than headlines might suggest. Referring back to Morningstar’s March 2024 Active/Passive Barometer: As long as active funds are beating their benchmarks, market dynamics reasonably imply continued participation from investors, portfolio managers, and institutions actively trading, researching, and trying to outperform. For those concerned that algorithmic or computer-driven trading may fuel a passive bubble, it’s worth noting that these technologies have been embedded in market operations for decades. Rather than introducing a new risk, they’ve long been a foundational part of how modern markets function. While vigilance is warranted, the evidence suggests that market concentration risks are manageable. Passive investing does come with its own set of risks, as does any strategy. But data and market history indicate abundant competition from active investors, which doesn’t support the idea that current trends are inflating a bubble. There is clearly still sustained interest in active investing, which suggests a low probability of the market losing its ability to function properly. The fact that 42% of active funds beat their passive peers in all categories in 2024, and even more so in real estate and bonds, underscores how active management remains a key force in price discovery, even as passive strategies grow. Investors are expected to continue utilizing passive strategies as one piece of a thoughtfully constructed portfolio that often includes active avenues as well. Passive investing isn’t perfect, but the data fail to support the argument that it poses an imminent systemic risk. By focusing on controllable factors such as diversification and costs, investors may better position themselves to grow wealth steadily over time as part of a disciplined, long-term retirement strategy.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The sell-off in the cryptocurrency market deepened over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin BTC$111,964.98 falling below $109,000 for the first time since July 9 and ether (ETH) posting a 13% correction from the record high of around $4,950 it hit just two days ago. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) and CoinDesk 80 (CD80) indices have dropped 2% and 3.3%, respectively, indicating larger losses in the broader altcoin market. The downside volatility toasted leveraged futures bets worth over $900 million, with long positions accounting for the majority of the tally. The slide kicked off on Sunday, when a whale sold 25,000 BTC in an illiquid market, sparking a flash crash. Several theories have been proposed to explain the whale's strategy, the most prominent being that they intentionally removed the bid wall — or block of buy orders — assuming that institutions would buy more through ETFs during the week, thereby lifting prices. "This whale is showing us something bigger, they know the ETF/sovereign bid is infinite. So the only way to win is to force weak hands to puke and then accumulate back into the structural wall," pseudonymous observer SightBringer said on X. According to MEXC Ventures, BTC is now at an inflexion point. It could enter a period of consolidation between $110,000 and $120,000 or break lower toward $105,000 to $100,000. "The absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish Fed policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed inflows, is likely to drive BTC into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution," MEXC's Investment Director Leo Zhao said in an email. Similarly, the consensus remains bullish on ether. However, the sharp decline from Sunday's record suggests a sustained breakout to new highs will probably require a significant catalyst beyond just corporate treasury adoption. XRP, meanwhile, lacks a clear directional trend. "With Bollinger Bands constricting and RSI sitting at a neutral 44, but thin on buying volume, the chart is whispering of a potential retest of $2.60 to $2.00," Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget said. "A break above the $3.10 level with conviction and volume, and a run toward $3.40 could follow. But derivative markets are skewed short, and upside stays guarded until momentum firms." In traditional markets, the Treasury yield curve, represented by the spread between 10- and two-year yields and 30- and two-year yields, continues to steepen as traders bet on a September Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, longer-duration Japanese government bond yields are on the verge of hitting new multidecade highs, which could potentially inject volatility into global financial markets. Stay alert!

Title: Nvidia Earnings Preview: Will AI Momentum Power Another Blowout Report?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/08/26/nvidia-earnings-preview-will-ai-momentum-power-another-blowout-report/

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Nvidia Corp. is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock just hit a record high of $184.48/share and is currently trading near $180. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $0.98/share on $45.91 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $1.06/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company’s earnings have grown nicely over the last few years. In 2020, the company earned $0.15/share. In 2021, earnings jumped to $0.25. Then, in 2022 earnings grew to $0.44. In 2023, earnings slid to $0.33 before exploding higher. In 2024, earnings grew to $1.30. In 2025, earnings are expected to grow to $2.99. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow to $4.42 and grow again to $6.03 in 2027! That growth is largely due to the very strong demand for its A.I. and crypto related chips. Technically, the stock is acting very well and just hit a fresh record high. The stock is trading above its 50 day moving average line (DMA) and above its longer-term 200 day moving average line which are both healthy signs. Furthermore, the stock is “only” 3% below its record high and can easily gap up to new highs if earnings are strong. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall if earnings fail to impress. NVIDIA’s earnings are getting a lot of attention because big trends like artificial intelligence, new rules from governments, and global demand could impact the bottom line. Investors want to know if the strong need for AI chips will continue, how export limits and global trading rules will affect sales—especially to places like China—and whether other new technologies might start to matter more for NVIDIA’s business. When results are reported, people will be watching closely to see how these things impact NVIDIA’s future. Here are some questions investors will be asking: Will AI stay a major driver going forward? How will regulations and international markets affect business? Could changes in technology or global demand shift the company’s growth path? How does the crypto market impact earnings? The stock has has established itself as a true market leader, demonstrating exceptional performance and influence across the tech sector and broader market. NVIDIA has significantly outpaced the overall market, driven by its pivotal role in the artificial intelligence revolution, crypto, and other important areas in our economy. Market strategists consider NVIDIA "the tell to the market," emphasizing its influence on overall market trends. The company's consistent outperformance, beating revenue estimates in the last several quarters, coupled with analysts' positive long-term outlook, underscores its position as a bellwether for the tech sector and a key driver for the broader market. Here’s the company profile, according to Yahoo! Finance: NVIDIA Corporation, a computing infrastructure company, provides graphics and compute and networking solutions in the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and internationally. The Compute & Networking segment includes its Data Centre accelerated computing platforms and artificial intelligence solutions and software; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing services. The Graphics segment offers GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU or vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building and operating industrial AI and digital twin applications. It also offers customized agentic solutions designed in collaboration with NVIDIA to accelerate enterprise AI adoption. The company's products are used in gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets. It sells its products to original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators and distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, add-in board manufacturers, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other ecosystem participants. NVIDIA Corporation was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com.

Title: Why Everyone Is Buying Bitcoin, And What You Need To Know

ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Bitcoin’s appeal has shifted between speculation, ideology, and innovation. But in 2025, the reasons for owning the world’s first decentralized digital currency appear more rooted in macroeconomics and politics than ever before. Inflation data continues to plague households, job markets face an uncertain future shaped by AI’s rapid expansion, and a growing divide in perspectives over the U.S. dollar’s direction. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s narrative as “hard money” is becoming clear. This article examines three converging forces, persistent inflation, economic stagnation, and political uncertainty, that are driving renewed demand for Bitcoin. July 2025’s inflation report showed consumer prices landing just under the Federal Reserve’s target, despite the added pressure of tariffs. While the month’s figures suggest some progress, longer-term data show inflation trending higher over time. For households, that continued upward slope means costs for essentials such as groceries, energy, and housing remain elevated, underscoring the ongoing challenge for policymakers. For investors, inflation diminishes the purchasing power of traditional savings. Cash in the bank is worth less tomorrow than today. This reality has revived interest in scarce assets that can hold value over time. Historically, gold served this role, but Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins offers a modern alternative. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded through central bank policy, Bitcoin’s issuance is predetermined by code. Economist Saifedean Ammous often describes this feature as “hard money.” A system resistant to inflationary debasement. Ammous argues that in an era of rising deficits, ballooning government spending, and a Federal Reserve still wielding extraordinary influence over markets, digital scarcity offers reassurance. Institutional adoption further supports this narrative. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, launched in the U.S. in 2024, have attracted billions in inflows, making it easier for retirement accounts, pensions, and retail investors alike to gain exposure. Another factor driving Bitcoin interest is less about money and more about work. 2025 labor-market data show slowing job creation, with wage growth struggling to keep pace with living costs. AI’s acceleration adds another layer of uncertainty. From automated call centers to AI-driven logistics, companies are investing heavily in efficiency. While AI adoption may boost productivity in the long run, it also raises questions about displacement and stagnant pay in the short term. The extent to which AI directly suppresses job growth is difficult to determine, but the perception of instability is real. This sense of economic unease has fueled interest in money perceived as both “hardest” and most accessible. Bitcoin, unlike stocks or bonds, does not require a brokerage account or financial advisor. It is open-source, borderless, and available to anyone with internet access. In uncertain times, accessibility matters. For younger generations, Bitcoin is not just an investment but a parallel system outside traditional financial gatekeepers. In a survey by Bank of America, people age 44 or younger consistently rank Bitcoin and other digital assets as preferred long-term holdings. The logic is straightforward. If the job market no longer guarantees stability, building resilience through alternative assets becomes a personal strategy. Politics can shape how economic challenges are perceived. President Donald Trump has repeatedly faulted the Federal Reserve for America’s financial strains, arguing that its interest rate policies have weakened confidence in the dollar. Against this backdrop, the divide is clear. some investors turn to Bitcoin as a hedge outside government control. Taken together, these forces, chronic inflation, job market anxiety, and political division, are creating momentum for Bitcoin. What was once a niche interest has entered mainstream financial conversations. ETF commercials run on prime-time television, professional athletes request salaries in Bitcoin, and major corporations continue to hold it on their balance sheets. However, Bitcoin’s volatility is not trivial. Prices continue to reach new highs, but can fall just as quickly. Investors must balance its potential as “hard money” with the reality that its market is still in infancy. Yet the trajectory of its adoption signals underlying strength. Each cycle of volatility brings new participants who hold through the turbulence, strengthening its base. As with gold in the 1970s or internet stocks in the 1990s, Bitcoin is moving from fringe asset to fixture in the global financial system. The question of why everyone is buying Bitcoin in 2025 has no single answer. It reflects a convergence of forces as inflation erodes savings, job stagnation challenges household stability, and political division raises doubts about the dollar’s future. For some, Bitcoin represents a hedge against inflation. For others, it is a tool of financial independence in an uncertain job market. And for many, it is an escape from political and institutional distrust. Together, these motivations create a powerful narrative of Bitcoin as hard money for uncertain times.

Title: OpenAI taps Instagram and Doximity execs to lead its next AI healthcare push
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-taps-doximity-cofounder-to-lead-its-next-healthcare-push-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-26T09:00:01Z

OpenAI is ramping up its push into healthcare with two high-profile new hires. The AI powerhouse has tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder and former chief strategy officer of Doximity, and Ashley Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to lead the next phase of its healthcare business. Gross joined OpenAI in June, while Alexander assumed her role on Tuesday, according to their LinkedIn profiles. An OpenAI spokesperson said Gross will lead OpenAI's go-to-market strategy in healthcare, with early goals including co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers. Alexander will be a vice president of product in OpenAI's health business, building tech for individual consumers and clinicians, the spokesperson said. Until now, OpenAI has mostly powered other companies' products and partnered on medical AI research, rather than competing directly with its own healthcare tech. But the company has been telegraphing its expanding healthcare ambitions for months. CEO Sam Altman spotlighted ChatGPT's healthcare skills during the August launch of GPT-5, calling the model "a legitimate Ph.D. expert." "It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey," Altman said, adding that GPT-5 performed "exceptionally well" on health-related questions. That performance was validated by HealthBench, OpenAI's first stand-alone healthcare tool, released in May. The open-source benchmark lets health systems, startups, and tech firms evaluate the accuracy and safety of health AI applications. OpenAI's healthcare ambitions reflect a larger pivot: OpenAI wants to own not just foundation models but also the infrastructure and AI applications built on top of them. In education, it launched Study Mode, a ChatGPT spinoff for students, in July to compete with Google's Gemini for Education. It demoed an AI sales agent in February, and rolled out an agentic tool that books reservations and shops for users in July. Healthcare AI is already crowded with tech giants. Palantir began developing AI for hospitals in 2021. Microsoft launched cloud-based clinician tools in 2020 and has since deepened ties with medical-records giant Epic to use AI in notetaking. Gross and Alexander's new roles at OpenAI aim to help the AI juggernaut pick up the pace. The OpenAI spokesperson said the company thinks "improving human health will be one of the defining impacts of AGI." Gross has deep roots in digital health. He cofounded Doximity 15 years ago as a "LinkedIn for doctors." In 2023, Doximity launched Doximity GPT, built on OpenAI tech, to help physicians with administrative tasks. So far this year, Doximity has acquired AI clinical evidence company Pathway Medical for $63 million and launched its own free AI scribe to compete with the likes of Microsoft and $5.3 billion startup Abridge. Doximity is one of the few healthcare companies that went public in 2021's IPO frenzy that isn't currently in the red. Despite significant share price fluctuations in the past four years, Doximity's stock is up over 60% above its opening price at IPO. Gross is also the cofounder of digital health investment and research firm Rock Health. Alexander worked at Meta for 12 years, 11 of which she spent on Instagram's product team, building out many of the app's features for advertising, creator monetization, and video content. OpenAI's health AI research to date has been spearheaded by Karan Singal, a former Google researcher who helped lead the development of the tech giant's medical LLM Med-PaLM. Singal will continue to run OpenAI's healthcare AI research, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI is hiring for at least two other roles in its health business. Its careers page lists openings for a health AI research scientist and a healthcare software engineer. Despite its plans to compete more directly with health startups, OpenAI isn't ditching its partnerships. The company most recently announced a collaboration with Kenyan primary care provider Penda Health in July to assess Penda Health's AI clinical copilot built on OpenAI's GPT-4o. It also continues to power the technology behind companies like pediatric care startup Summer Health and health insurtech Oscar Health. Jump to

Title: Larry Kudlow on Trump Intel agreement: ‘I am very, very uncomfortable ‘

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/25/2025 6:33:00 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow expressed concern on Friday over the Trump administration’s move to take a 10 percent stake in mega chipmaker Intel. “I am very, very uncomfortable with that idea. I’m very uncomfortable with that one, but that’s a conversation for another meal on another day,” Kudlow told economist Stephen Moore, in an interview highlighted by Mediate. Moore himself, a Trump economic adviser, earlier in the appearance, also criticized the administration’s decision, calling it “terrible.” “I hate corporate welfare. That’s privatization in reverse. We want the government to divest of assets, not buy assets.

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Anne Laurie| August 25, 20256:53 pm| 11 Comments This post is in: Excellent Links, Grifters Gonna Grift, Science & Technology, Trump Crime Cartel Palantir has been getting a huge number of deals like this, in what is extremely obviously self-dealing. [image or embed] — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@reichlinmelnick.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 2:47 PM === I mean, when you wear the VP on your arm like the skin-puppet he is, why wouldn't you capitalize on that? — David (@dkboyd.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 3:27 PM I’ve been curious, and I thought y’all might be too. From Wired, “What Does Palantir Actually Do?”: Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance. But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it’s a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist… The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It’s really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it’s hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?” Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is… Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.” Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir’s flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart? Part of the answer may lie in Palantir’s marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir’s main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. What it’s ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”… Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir’s offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan. Crucially, Palantir doesn’t reorganize a company’s bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn’t change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer’s messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it’s a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s. Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors… Palantir’s software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir’s two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users. Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry. Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they’re ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any. A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person’s network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver’s license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos… In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people’s intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir’s users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it. “It’s a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it’s in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.” ****** I quite enjoyed the Economist's article on Palantir: "Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time What would make it worth buying?" So sad to see the bubble bursting at bit. So very sad. www.economist.com/finance-and-… [image or embed] — notsewmot.bsky.social (@notsewmot.bsky.social) August 20, 2025 at 6:34 PM The Economist asks, “What Would Make It Worth Buying?” … No one can accuse Palantir, a data-analysis outfit and the most searingly hot stock of 2025, of unspectacular growth. It reported revenue of $1bn for the second quarter of this year, 48% higher than for the second quarter of 2024 and quadruple the figure for the same period in 2020. Silicon Valley types seek out companies satisfying the “rule of 40”, meaning that the sum of their operating margin and year-on-year sales growth, both expressed in percentage points, is higher than 40. Palantir’s score on that measure is 94: higher than any other enterprise-software firm with equivalent or greater sales. Among the world’s 25 biggest companies by market value—of which Palantir is one—only Nvidia, with its near-monopoly on artificial-intelligence chips, scores higher. Any investor would want a piece of that. The trouble is that Palantir’s market value has already soared to $430bn (see chart 1), more than 600 times its past year’s earnings and nearly triple the equivalent multiple for Cisco (or, indeed, Nvidia) at its peak. Software firms often prefer to express their valuation in terms of underlying sales, which puts Palantir’s multiple at around 120. For comparison, in 2005, the year before the Oxford English Dictionary added the verb “Google”, Google’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 22. You need not look far to explain why Adam Parker of Trivariate Research, an investment firm, has published a note entitled “Could Palantir be the best short idea?” Writing in late May, he examined the ratio of enterprise value (which adjusts market value to account for debt and cash on the balance-sheet) to forecast sales for the coming year. On this measure Palantir then scored 73 and now scores 104. Mr Parker looked for other listed companies that had hit a multiple of 70 since 2000. Excluding financial firms and those with annual revenue of less than $50m, he found 14, the largest of which has a market value around a quarter of Palantir’s. That was Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a firm that sells some software but pitches itself to investors as a “bitcoin treasury company”, with a value derived from its cryptocurrency holdings rather than its sales… What, then, would it take to make Palantir’s shares worth buying? The firm helps everyone from spooks to fast-food chains analyse their data better and thereby improve their operations. Its blistering recent growth comes, in large part, from enthusiasm over adopting AI for such purposes. Palantir’s competitive advantage derives not just from its software and clever engineers, but from a high-level security clearance allowing it to process classified information from America’s defence and intelligence agencies. This gives it a “moat” with which to fend off competitors… Sustained revenue growth of that magnitude or more is possible, even at Palantir’s scale: Google (now called Alphabet), Meta and Nvidia have all managed it. Yet none was priced to do so in advance—and they are, after all, among the most successful firms in history. On a call with analysts and investors after announcing Palantir’s most recent results, Alex Karp, the chief executive (pictured), admitted that “this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter.” The remarkable thing is that shareholders need the company’s revenue to continue to grow at a similar rate just to have a good chance of breaking even. There is no allowance for an upstart competitor, a scandal that makes clients wary or even a mere slowdown. If any of those strike, Cisco will need to make way for a new cautionary tale. Once we turf out the current batch of malefactors, could an honest administration pull Palantir’s vaunted security clearance, possibly while Peter Thiel stands before a Truth & Reconciliation Commission? ****** Fairness requirement: Strenuous argument against Palantir’s whole existence: Palantir: the world’s most evil company open.substack.com/pub/politica… [image or embed] — Ck (@ck-100.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 6:40 PM Filter No commenters available.

Tolkien, who is both FAR more honorable and FAR more significant than they ever will be! Old School August 25, 2025 at 7:05 pm I’m unclear as to whether Palantir is actually capable of producing the Navy and Air Force projects. Or is completion not really a deciding factor here? bbleh August 25, 2025 at 7:08 pm @Old School: this being the Trump era (see also Musk, Elon), I’m guessing that actually DOING things as opposed simply to talking about them and scooping up money from the gullible is … not a priority.

Betty August 25, 2025 at 7:19 pm I would like to know if the existing contractors have a cause of action against Palantir for interfering in their contracts.

Dorothy A. Winsor August 25, 2025 at 7:35 pm I saw the headline and thought “the palantir is a communication device.” But no. Wrong universe. Martin August 25, 2025 at 7:54 pm @Old School: Hard to tell without more details. But Palantir basically specializes in recognizing a companies technical debt, and rather than helping a company solve it, just layer a new system on top that uses AI, etc. to try and replicate what your system ought to be doing, but in a different way. For instance in my career I was fairly notorious for building tools that could solve problems that the maintainers of the data couldn’t do. Their systems were collect information on students, or research expenditures, or payroll, etc but the tools weren’t designed to give broad insights on what was happening in those areas. They were useful for tracking A student, or A grant, or AN employee, but not seeing larger patterns. One way to solve that problem is to rework your tools so they are capable of doing that, but these tools are generally designed to enforce processes, and as such they are the laws of your organization in code, and reworking them can be very expensive, because any departures from how they worked before are effectively rewriting the laws of your organization. When I wasn’t part of the group responsible for the tool, but was tasked with providing the insight, rewriting the tools wasn’t an option – I didn’t own that system. Instead, I’d scrape that system in one way or another – pull from their dataset if I could get that permission, but as a last resort simply build a tool that emulated an employee accessing their tool and just scrape records from their UI. And from their data build a new tool that was designed to give the insight we needed – focusing on groups of students, demographics, categories of research or faculty, etc. You don’t need to rewrite the tool this way. It’s a way for an organization to neglect their technical debt a while longer but also can help an organization see the need to abstract their policy enforcement through code from their data from their code analysis. This is kind of what the microservices design pattern seeks to do as well. It’s not a bad approach, though if you are using it to neglect your technical debt it’s bad. Palantir does two things, from what I understand: Marc August 25, 2025 at 8:32 pm A year or so after 9/11 I was working on code with the PhD students for an “NSF” grant (we used to go to the sponsor’s meetings at the Ft Meade Travelodge) to look at communications flow between teams of workers on massive construction projects (nuclear plants, transit systems, etc.). This involved collecting massive amounts of metadata (no content) associated with email, CAD file updates, project change orders, and milestone completions. With some statistical analysis that could converted into an abstract model of the actual (as opposed to formal) organizational structure that would drive a simulation. Then we’d run the simulation thousands of times using genetic and ML algorithms to determine the “optimal” organizational structures for cost/schedule on future similar projects. Or, you could also figure out whom to remove to ensure that a project would never reach completion. That, among other things, is what Palantir does. JaneE August 26, 2025 at 12:33 am I don’t understand how Palantir could “overhaul antiquated human resources systems” if all it does is extract the old data from the existing antiquated system and give the users tools to generate analyses and give them better access to the old data. It would be a band-aid for the old system to let the users have better data until the system were overhauled. At that point the users would have the choice of whatever the newer system offered or let Palantir hoover up the new data to generate their analyses and reports. How does Palantir add new information if they don’t actually change the old system? I worked on those antiquated systems when they were new. Unless they actually have been updated to the newer languages and database structures getting information out is limited by what can be put in in the first place. If they already have all the data they need and just want to get additional views of the information without the time of programming it this might be a good solution, but that doesn’t sound like what the scrapped project was doing. Even if the Palantir solution is a good fit for what they want(ed) to do, this scrapping 12 years (and who knows how many man-years) of work because they want a specific (well connected politically) company to be given a chance to bid sounds like a totally corrupt deal. They didn’t bid 12 years ago – for whatever reason – so scrapping the current contractor really is nothing but political. Do the procurement regulations allow that type of patronage contracting? Aaron August 27, 2025 at 1:12 am @JaneE: Sounds like a good time to be wrapping up a boatload of acquisition deregulation, doesn’t it? Your email address will not be published.

Title: 350,000 Black Women Were Ousted From The Workforce—For Millennials, Where Are They Going Next?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2025/08/25/350000-black-women-were-ousted-from-the-workforce-for-millennials-where-are-they-going-next/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T22:42:24Z
Full Content:
ByJasmine Browley, Contributor. As I’ve stated time and time again, millennials know how to hustle. From the time we reached our formative years, our identities were melded into our professions. So imagine what happens when our merit is systemically attacked at a government level. When the most recent jobs report revealed that 350,000 Black women had left the labor force, I resisted the instinct to call those exits voluntary. “I personally term that as being ousted,” I told the experts I interviewed, “because a lot of those exits were not optional.” Behind that staggering number are women who are losing not only paychecks but also the stability, health access, and professional pathways that keep families and communities afloat. What happens next for them? Some are rebuilding through entrepreneurship, others are demanding systemic reforms, and all are navigating the intersection of workforce inequity and personal resilience. “Job loss directly translates into reduced income and potentially a loss of health insurance,” explained Fade Adetosoye, who helped lead a recent McKinsey study on Black maternal health and workforce participation. “That makes it harder for women to afford prenatal and postpartum care, medications, and services for conditions like gestational diabetes or hypertension—things that disproportionately impact Black women.” The ripple effects are profound. McKinsey’s research estimates that addressing the Black maternal health gap could add $25 billion to the U.S. economy annually and save $385 billion in healthcare costs. Without intervention, Black mothers lose an average of 14–15 healthy days per year for the rest of their lives due to childbirth-related conditions. “We’re talking 350,000 healthy years lost that women could be spending participating in the economy, investing in their families and communities,” Adetosoye told me. Her conclusion is stark: “The gold standard for birthing people should not be survival. It should be thriving. And there is absolutely a tie between Black maternal health disparities and economic mobility.” For Michelda Castro, the ousting wasn’t theoretical. She had climbed through finance and government program management roles, even overseeing a $69 million loan fund for underserved communities. But repeated experiences with bias, systemic barriers, and finally, layoffs tied to shifting federal priorities, left her searching for something more sustainable. “I was stressed, having panic attacks at work, working 60, 70 hours a week,” she recounted to me. “They told me I was doing a great job, but when the director role opened up—the one I’d been running for nine months—they didn’t even give me an interview. Then they asked me to train the white man they hired instead.” After another corporate stint ended in layoffs due to federal grant cuts handed down by the Trump administration, Castro leaned fully into entrepreneurship. More than a decade ago, she founded Versatile Image, a nonprofit that hosts the Unity Block Party in Utah, an annual cultural and economic festival that now generates over $100,000 in revenue. With the layoff, she focused renewed energy and focus into making the once side hustle into her full-time career. Still, she says the uphill climb is relentless: federal grants have been slashed and are continuing to be so, corporate sponsors have pulled out due to DEI alignment concerns, and banks remain reluctant to extend capital. “If I were a white man, the struggle would be glamorized—like starting Amazon in a garage,” she said. “But when it’s a Black woman, people call it complaining.” The broader context, says Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families and co-leader of the 75 Million Campaign, is that today’s job losses are less about performance and more about politics. “When you lose a job not because of your work but because of a political agenda, it can feel demoralizing,” Frye told me. “And for Black women, particularly Black mothers—more than 80% of whom are the primary breadwinners—it threatens the stability of entire families.” She points to the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as both a cause and a consequence. “This administration has deployed a different narrative, but the purpose is the same as always: to erode the pathways that allowed Black women even a chance at the middle class,” Frye told me. Her call to action: don’t internalize the systemic failures. “This is not about individual deficiencies. It’s an ideological agenda. And we must push back—not only to protect jobs, but to protect the progress that got us here in the first place.” Despite the structural barriers, Black women continue to lead in entrepreneurship. According to American Express data, Black women are the fastest-growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the U.S., a trend likely to accelerate as traditional pathways constrict. “I don’t want to just survive pregnancy, or layoffs, or discrimination,” Adetosoye told me. “I want to thrive. And thriving means being able to build wealth, plan estates, and contribute fully to the economy.” Castro echoed the same sentiment, this time through the lens of her community. “When I couldn’t find joy in corporate America, I built it myself. That’s what the Unity Block Party is—it’s our refusal to be erased.” This year, she was sure to lean in on the joy element by tapping headliner Durand Bernard, a popular singer that often weaves messages of self-care in his songs. “I am so excited‚” Castro told me. “We need this happiness more than ever.” The exodus of 350,000 Black women from the labor force is more than a statistic—it’s a referendum on whether the U.S. economy values their contributions. For Adetosoye, Castro, and Frye, the answer is to build new systems: of care, of capital, of narrative. “Black women, especially younger generations, like millennials, are resilient,” Frye said. “But resilience should not be the requirement for survival in this economy. We deserve systems that work for us, not against us.”

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Shareholders of a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 in Novo Nordisk A/S Lawsuit – NVO

August 25, 2025 17:54 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=163051&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock’s rapid rise on the back of booming AI demand has already made the chipmaker the world’s most valuable company. Most Wall Street analysts think its stock still has room to climb. Expectations are on the rise ahead of the company’s earnings after the bell Wednesday, with Baird on Monday bumping its price target up to $225 from $195, after Stifel over the weekend lifted its to $212 from $202. Several others, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Wedbush, lifted theirs last week. Those targets are consistent with most others on the Street. Of the 14 analysts with current ratings surveyed by Visible Alpha, 10 have targets between $200 and $225, with two at or just above $190, and one that calls the stock a "buy" without a target. Just one expects the stock to decline from its recent levels to $155. The stock rose 1% Monday to close just under $180, and has added over a third of its value in 2025 so far. "We continue to believe that NVDA’s leadership positioning in AI infrastructure remains unchallenged," Stifel analysts said. They pointed to optimism around improving China sales after Nvidia struck a revenue-sharing deal with the Trump administration in order to resume sales of AI chips to the region, and Trump signaled the company could win more licenses for future chips. Baird similarly highlighted Nvidia's strong position and "lack of relevant competition for the medium term," as well as signs of an acceleration in shipments of its GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip. The chipmaker is widely expected to report another quarterly sales record, despite some headwinds from export restrictions that were in place before Nvidia's recent revenue-sharing deal.

Title: Can Meta Platforms Stock Hit $800 By The End Of 2025?

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Given Meta Platform’s strong Q2 performance, modest valuation compared to Google and Microsoft, and optimistic growth forecasts, Meta stock is likely to top $800 within weeks. Whether the stock continues to rise depends on whether the company reports Q3 results that beat expectations and raises its forecasts for Q4 growth and profitability. If Meta falls short on Q3 growth or Q4 guidance, the stock could tumble way below $800 by the end of 2025. Read on for a discussion of how much Meta’s stock has risen so far this year, the forces propelling and impeding the company’s growth, how the Facebook parent’s valuation compares to rivals and where analysts see the stock going in the next year. Meta stock has been on a roll. In 2024, shares of the Facebook parent increased 69% – rising from $354 to $600 a share. As of August 25, Meta shares had risen another 26% to $755. With a mere 3% more to rise to reach $800 a share, Meta appears more likely than not to surpass that target by the end of 2025. Meta's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and its strong core advertising business, coupled with a vast user base, present significant growth opportunities for the company. Meta's core ad business remains robust, with strong revenue growth in 2025 driven by AI-enhanced ad targeting, increased advertiser adoption of AI tools and higher engagement across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Threads. AI integration has led to increased conversion rates for ads, particularly on Reels, according to AInvest. Meta continues to see growth in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads with daily active users growing 6% to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Improved content recommendation algorithms and features like Reels contribute to increased time spent on the platforms, further enhancing the advertising opportunity, Zacks noted. Meta's aggressive investments in AI infrastructure, including data centers and AI models like Llama 4, could help the company’s business lines grow. The Meta AI chatbot and assistant are gaining traction, nearing one billion monthly active users, suggesting potential for AI-driven experiences and new revenue streams. Meta's AI strategy also includes AI-powered glasses and potential enterprise applications for businesses, SeekingAlpha wrote. Meta posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, showing its core ad business remains strong at a time when the company is investing billions of dollars into AI. The results show the extent to which Meta’s advertising business will continue to pay for its outsize AI ambitions, as well as how the AI tools are contributing to its strength, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta beat analyst expectations and increased guidance. Sales came in at $47.5 billion, ahead of analyst expectations. Net income for the second quarter was $18.3 billion, also ahead of market expectations. Cost-cutting measures and a focus on efficiency also contributed to Meta’s healthy financial position, the Journal noted. Meta also said it expects to post between 17% and 24% revenue growth for the current quarter. “The investments it’s making in AI are already paying off in its ads business,” eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Journal. Meta also faces hurdles — including regulatory pressures, high capital expenditures for AI and the continued losses in its Reality Labs division. Meta faces intense competition in both the social media and digital advertising sectors from established players like Google and emerging platforms like TikTok, as well as from new entrants in AI. TikTok is a significant threat to Meta's social media dominance and the Facebook parent’s ability to attract advertising. Google and OpenAI are key competitors in the development of AI capabilities, particularly regarding large language models, according to Variety. Meta faces many regulatory challenges, particularly in the European Union and the United States. The European Digital Markets Act could reduce Meta’s European ad revenue in the second half of 2025, according to Team SciDA, while an ongoing FTC antitrust lawsuit poses the risk of forced divestitures of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported Wired. The Reality Labs division, Meta's metaverse and VR/AR segment, continues to operate at a significant loss, raising questions about its long-term viability and return on investment. Meta's Reality Labs division reported $4.53 billion in the second quarter of 2025, despite generating $370 million in revenue, according to Digital Music News. This loss is a result of investments in VR and AR technologies, including the Meta Quest headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Meta's increased capital spending for AI infrastructure (estimated between $64 billion and $72 billion for 2025) could pressure margins and profitability in the short term, according to InvestorsObserver. It remains to be seen whether these large capital investments will result in a better return on investment than has the company’s investments in the metaverse — which prompted the company’s name change from Facebook. While sporting a moderate valuation compared to peers, Meta’s stock price, revenue growth, and net margin have outpaced those of Google and Microsoft. Here are the details: Based on short-term price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $866.92. The forecasts range from a low of $658.00 to a high of $1,086.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.84% from the last closing price of $782.13, according to Zacks Research. One analyst was impressed with Meta’s Q2 report – raising his high price target to $900. "What was that? WOW," Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said in a client note featured by Investor’s Business Daily. "Meta destroyed expectations with perhaps one of the biggest prints in their history." Wedbush's Meta stock analyst Scott Devitt raised his price target from $750 to $920, reported IBD. Meta stock needs to rise 3% more to top $800 by the end of 2025. It is likely that will happen as long as Meta beats growth expectations and raises guidance when it presents its next earnings report.

Growth in the use of ETFs and SMAs is changing how muni portfolios are constructed, reports Bond Buyer. Morningstar gives investors a closer look at potential pitfalls of using funds of funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 25, 2025 ETF and SMA Growth Is Reshaping How Muni Portfolios Are Built and Managed “At The Bond Buyer's Buy-Side Summit, panelists from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, and BAM Mutual explore how demand for customization, transparency, and active strategies is transforming the muni fund landscape.” (Bond Buyer) Funds of Private Funds for the Masses? What Investors Need to Know About the SEC’s Latest Guidance “Secondary managers have a habit of buying these funds at discounts to their net asset values and then immediately marking them back up to their NAVs once they own them. This can create illusory returns, as the apparent gains are just on paper and the result of an accounting trick. Secondary managers who do this are essentially pulling future returns into the present by assuming they can at least get the private fund’s NAV if they have to sell it today, even though they may have bought it yesterday at a discount.” (Morningstar) What Barron Capital’s Newest ETFs Say About Interest in Active Investing “Dave Nadig, Nadig.com independent ETF expert, joins CNBC’s Frank Holland on ‘Halftime Report’ to discuss Baron Capital’s entrance into the ETF market and why going active could work for the firm.” (CNBC) Stanger: Private Non-Traded REITs Outraise Publicly Traded Counterparts by 45% “Private non-traded real estate investment trusts outraised their publicly registered non-traded counterparts by over 45% to start the year, attracting over $4.2 billion of investor capital compared to $2.9 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. This is according to the latest analysis by Robert A. Stanger & Company Inc., an investment banking firm and leader in alternative investment industry research. In Q2 2025, private non-traded REITs grew their aggregate net asset value to $24 billion, a 10.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, further cementing their expanding share of the non-traded REIT market.” (AltsWire) It’s Not Too Early to Look at Tax-Exempt Bond ETFs “Fall is just around the corner, and with it comes the start of portfolio preparation for the end of the year. For many investors and advisors, that means adding investments that can help reduce the tax bill from portfolios. Tax exempt bond ETFs in particular can provide a powerful tool in meeting that goal. Leaning on the ETF wrapper, those funds may be worth adding now amid continued interest rate uncertainty.” (VettaFi) Fintech Upstarts Are Powering a Boom—and Ecosystem—for Private Markets “Sophisticated platforms—typically catering to private-wealth advisers—aim to ease their clients’ ownership and management of assets in private credit, real estate, private equity and other alternative investments that, until recently, were reserved for institutional investors and the super-wealthy. New software tools, digital tokenization and AI are being put to work to remove longstanding pain points in everything from making products discoverable to executing transactions, managing ownership stakes and educating advisers and their clients.” (PitchBook) Beleaguered Private Investment B-D Draws More Regulatory Scrutiny “Linqto Capital, a private stock investment platform that last month filed for bankruptcy protection after drawing scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.” (Financial Advisor IQ) The Democratization of Private Equity Could Create a “Systemic Risk Machine” “Private equity’s success depends on patient, locked-up capital insulated from the mood swings of public markets. Retail flows bring the opposite: liquidity demands, shorter investment horizons, and a political reflex for heavier oversight. Regulatory tripwires abound: Once retirement-plan investments exceed 25 percent of a fund’s assets, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules apply, dragging in the kind of compliance costs and fiduciary constraints that sap agility.” (Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research) Yieldstreet’s Real Estate Struggles Could Shake Fractional Ownership Market “Yieldstreet, a once-heralded platform promising to democratize access to private real estate, recently disclosed steep losses and defaults in a large swath of its real estate deals. The ripple effects of these bad investments extended beyond its investor base. A recent review of 30 real-estate offerings revealed that four deals ended in total loss and another 23 are on watchlists and have triggered approximately $78 million in defaults in just the past year.” (Propmodo) This Classic Investment Strategy Is Still Alive in 2025 “The merit of a classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a matter of debate in recent years. A diversified 60/40 strategy failed to protect investors in 2022’s broad market crash—in fact, an all-stock portfolio would have held up better. However, a historical deep dive from Morningstar concluded that the tried-and-true approach lessened the pain in almost all of the worst market crashes in 150 years better than an all-stock portfolio. Morningstar Inc Portfolio Strategist Amy Arnott discusses the 60/40 portfolio’s ups and downs and its performance in 2025.” (Morningstar) Thoma Bravo Secures Leeway from Backers to Hand Slice of PE Deals to Other Investors “US software-focused private equity group negotiated broad carve-out in recent funds’ terms.” (Financial Times) Related:Wall Street Exit Culminates in Climate Group Halting Activities Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

Data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers' $9 billion exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investment advisors drove institutional Bitcoin (BTC) exposure via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to $33.6 billion during the second quarter of 2025. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Aug. 25 revealed that institutions added 57,375 BTC across all tracked categories. Bloomberg Intelligence data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers’ $9 billion exposure. Brevan Howard Capital Management emerged as the largest institutional Bitcoin ETF shareholder among the new investors. The fund manager increased its BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holdings by 71% to 37.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion as of June 30. Harvard Management Company entered the Bitcoin ETF space with a $117 million position in IBIT. Harvard’s Bitcoin allocation ranks alongside its largest US-listed holdings, including Microsoft at $310 million and Amazon near $235 million, representing approximately 8% of its reported portfolio. The university endowment now holds more Bitcoin than gold in dollars, with its SPDR Gold Trust position valued at roughly $102 million at quarter-end. Seyffart also highlighted that advisors have become “by far the biggest holders” of spot Bitcoin ETFs. They added 37,156 BTC during the second quarter and reached 161,909 BTC. He said that “pretty much every category” out of the 15 listed had increasing exposure during the second quarter, except pension funds, which maintained $10.7 million positions. Brokerage firms’ allocation via Bitcoin ETFs reached $4.3 billion, after the second-largest addition among institutions of 13,911 BTC. Banks registered the third-largest allocation of 2,476 BTC, and now have roughly $655 million in Bitcoin through ETF shares. Investment advisors’ $17.4 billion allocation exceeds the combined holdings of hedge funds, brokerages, and holding companies, signaling a shift toward professional wealth management integration. Seyffart noted that the $33.6 billion allocated by institutional investors relates to 13F form filings, representing only 25% of the total Bitcoin ETF shares. He added: “The other 75% are owned by non-filers which is largely going to be retail.” Despite the increasing institutional appetite, retail appears to drive most of the Bitcoin ETF still flows.

Wells Fargo's wealth management unit partnered with InvestCloud to add private market investments to its UMA program. August 25, 2025 Wells Fargo has become the latest wealth management firm to add alternative investment options to its UMA platform. Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division formed a partnership with fintech firm InvestCloud to make alternative assets available through the wirehouse's personalized UMA program. The UMA program now includes a full range of alternative investment options, from private equity and private debt to hedge funds and real assets. The program uses both perpetual and drawdown fund structures. Wells joins a spate of firms that have recently added private market options to UMA platforms, including Fidelity and Goldman Sachs. “We are committed to providing new technologies that deliver personalized, scalable and data-driven client experiences,” Greg Maddox, product management executive at Wells Fargo Investment Management, said in a statement. “We are proud to offer industry-leading investment capabilities and find new and innovative ways to make the company an easier place for advisors and clients to do business.” Earlier this year, InvestCloud struck a partnership with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management to become part of its Private Markets Account (PMA) Network, which combines public and public assets in a single platform.

Title: Nvidia Stock May See Its Biggest Post-Earnings Move in a Year This Week

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Bitcoin Flash Crash Roils Crypto Market

Time Published: 2025-08-25T17:50:49Z

Crypto prices dipped Monday following a so-called flash crash of Bitcoin on Sunday. And while Ethereum dipped as well, the second most popular cryptocurrency is still up significantly on the month. Bitcoin’s weekend crash is being blamed on a single whale who sold 24,000 Bitcoin, according to crypto watchers on X. Bitcoin’s most recent peak hit $117,370 on Friday, not too far from the all-time high of $124,500. But Bitcoin is currently sitting at $112,660, well below recent highs. “Bitcoin flash crash today, which wiped out $310M in long positions, has been traced to a SINGLE Bitcoin whale dumping BTC for ETH. The whale sold 24,000+ BTC, including coins that hadnât moved in 5+ years, sending 12,000+ BTC today alone to the Hyperunite trading platform,” crypto analyst Jacob King tweeted on Sunday. “Theyâve sold 18,000+ BTC ($2B) so far and are in the process of dumping the remaining 6,000+ BTC ($670M). Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked,” King continued. That sale seemed to set off a chain reaction and a flurry of selling with $100 billion wiped out in just 24 hours, according to Forbes, as traders seemed to worry about whether the optimism from Jerome Powell’s statements Friday might be a mirage. Powell signaled he may lower interest rates at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve in September. But others are more skeptical that the price really swung due to a whale, suggesting that it could be due to “multiple whales,” rather than a single entity, according to The Block. Whatever the reason for bitcoin’s pullback, there’s no doubt that Ethereum has been faring better in recent days. Ethereum is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours to $4,637, but is still up 24% on the month, according to CoinMarketCap. Why is Ethereum doing so well lately? There are a lot of different theories, including the popularity of spot ETFs, which now account for about $30.5 billion or 5.2% of Ethereum’s market cap, according to The Street. But there’s also just been a lot of hype in mainstream news outlets about Ethereum, with a recent story in the Wall Street Journal touting all the big money that’s “piling into” the cryptocurrency. One of those investors is apparently Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal. The Journal reports that people close to Thiel believe his “recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing.” But that kind of hype should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Founders Fund, Thiel’s venture capital firm, quietly sold about $1.8 billion in crypto by the end of March 2022, not long before the crypto crash of 2022. Thiel had cashed out at a time when he was hyping crypto like crazy, telling a crypto conference in Miami around the same time that “weâre at the end of the fiat money regime.” Thiel made no mention at the conference that he was selling at what would be near the top just before a crash, according to the Financial Times, which only revealed his sales in January 2023. Thiel really has a knack for buying low and selling high, which is the smart play for any investor with discipline. But that’s obviously not how markets actually work in practice, crypto or otherwise. People buy at the top because they fear missing out, and then get left holding the bag by guys like Thiel. The question, of course, is whether crypto’s most recent highs are sustainable. The Trump regime’s embrace of crypto has been great news for the industry, but nobody knows whether the number can continue to just go up, given the uncertainty of America’s economic outlook. There’s also the small problem that crypto is little more than a speculative asset with no inherent value. Despite countless promises from crypto boosters over the past 15 years, the average person isn’t using crypto to actually buy goods on a regular basis. The Block reports that big players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity have seen $1.4 billion in net outflows for crypto last week, the highest since March, as investors get skittish. Other cryptocurrencies were also struggling Monday, including Ripple which is down 2%, Solana down over 4%, TRON down over 3%, and Dogecoin down 5%.

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

U.S. equities were mixed and little changed at midday as the market awaited more key corporate earnings reports this week, including from Nvidia (NVDA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell, while the Nasdaq gained. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the beverage giant announced it was paying $18 billion to purchase Peet's Coffee parent JDE Peet's, and intends to split into two parts: coffee and soft drinks. Shares of furniture retailers RH (RH), Wayfair (W), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled after President Donald Trump said he would soon be putting tariffs on furniture imports. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares dropped on a downgrade from Bank of America, which said that while the Sydney Sweeney ad campaign may boost the clothing retailer in the near term, tariffs would likely hurt results. Netflix (NFLX) shares advanced on indications the biggest streaming service's animated film "Kpop Demon Hunters," which was shown in movie theaters over the weekend, was a box-office hit. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) rose on positive comments from Cantor Fitzgerald, which reiterated its "overweight" rating on the chipmaker. Intel (INTC) shares were up again after a 5.5% jump on Friday after the U.S. took about a 10% stake in the struggling semiconductor manufacturer. Oil futures were higher. Gold prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower. TradingView

August 25, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced the general availability of the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor™ developer kit and production modules, powerful new robotics computers designed to power millions of robots across industries including manufacturing, logistics, transportation, healthcare, agriculture and retail. Early adopters include industry leaders Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon, Medtronic and Meta, while 1X, John Deere, OpenAI and Physical Intelligence are evaluating Jetson Thor to advance their physical AI capabilities. “We’ve built Jetson Thor for the millions of developers working on robotic systems that interact with and increasingly shape the physical world,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With unmatched performance and energy efficiency, and the ability to run multiple generative AI models at the edge, Jetson Thor is the ultimate supercomputer to drive the age of physical AI and general robotics.” The Ultimate Platform for Next-Generation RoboticsPowered by an NVIDIA Blackwell GPU and featuring 128GB of memory, Jetson Thor delivers up to 2,070 FP4 teraflops of AI compute to effortlessly run the latest AI models — all within a 130-watt power envelope. Compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin™, Jetson Thor delivers up to 7.5x higher AI compute and 3.5x greater energy efficiency to run any generative AI model — from vision language action models like NVIDIA Isaac™ GR00T N1.5 to popular large language and vision language models. The new system-on-module solves one of the most significant challenges in robotics: running multi-AI workflows to enable robots to have real-time, intelligent interactions with people and the physical world. Jetson Thor unlocks real-time inference, critical for highly performant physical AI applications spanning humanoid robotics, agriculture and surgical assistance. Global Robotics Leaders Build on Jetson Thor Jetson Thor is powered by the full-stack NVIDIA Jetson™ software platform, built for physical AI and humanoid robotics, which supports any popular AI framework and generative AI model.

August 25, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: NVIDIA’s H20 China AI GPU Is Now Completely Banned In The Country, Says Report

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU giant NVIDIA's H20 chips have been banned in China, suggests a report which quotes investment bank Jefferies. NVIDIA's H20 GPUs have been at the center of US trade tensions with China, after the Trump administration granted the firm licenses to sell them, multiple reports surfaced about Chinese discomfort with using the GPUs due to their US origin. However, one snippet of an investment note purportedly from Jefferies shared on social media claims that the H20 GPUs have been completely banned in China, which prevents Chinese firms from placing orders with NVIDIA. In a note purportedly belonging to Jefferies and shared on X, the investment bank outlines that Chinese authorities have completely banned NVIDIA H20 AI GPU sales in the country. The note follows several recent reports that have claimed that NVIDIA has asked some supply chain partners to halt H20 production. Jefferies also quotes these reports, as it outlines that media reports indicate that the H20 can no longer be sold in China. However, the bank also adds that "our industry checks indicate China has officially banned the procurement of H20 and other 'downgraded US AI chips' until further notice. As a result, Chinese entities are now forbidden from buying the NVIDIA GPUs, which appears to be a step up over earlier reports that have indicated that the Chinese government had simply required state-linked computing clusters to use at least 50% of domestic AI chips. As a result, Jefferies notes that "no Chinese companies will place orders with NVDA." The bank also adds that its channel checks in Taiwan have yielded the same results as media reports. "Our industry checks in Taiwan also indicate NVDA has suspended all packaging and server production work related to H20, also 'until further notice,' says the bank. As a result, Jefferies concludes that NVIDIA will be unable to generate any AI chip revenue from China, "likely until the US and China come to an agreement on trade." If the note bears fruit, then NVIDIA could see more headaches in the Asian country just as it is about to report its earnings. The shares are flat in premarket trading and enter the week after having lost 1.5% over the past five trading days. Since NVIDIA is in quiet period ahead of its earnings, it cannot comment on news, which creates an ample opportunity for short sellers to target the stock on any expected weakness. 1) According to Jefferey's note on the 24th, it suggests fimr's industry checks indicate that "China has OFFICIALLY BANNED the procurement of H20 AND other downgraded U.S. AI chips until further notice" It also said that its checks in Taiwan "indicate $NVDA has suspended all… pic.twitter.com/0OBtCdqE8Z Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cybersecurity firm, is slated to release earnings on Wednesday, August 27, 2025. For event-driven traders, reviewing how the stock has behaved around prior earnings announcements can offer useful perspective. Over the past five years, CrowdStrike’s one-day move after earnings has been evenly split between gains and losses. In 50% of instances, the stock posted a positive one-day return with a median gain of 9.8%. In the remaining 50%, it recorded a negative one-day return with a median decline of -5.6%. Although the actual results and management guidance typically drive the largest moves, these historical tendencies can still inform positioning. Given the equal split between positive and negative one-day outcomes, trading solely on the event is challenging. Traders might weigh two broad approaches: While earnings can introduce volatility, the longer-term picture has favored investors: since early January 2021, CrowdStrike has advanced about 100%, rising from roughly $210 to $420, far outpacing the S&P 500’s approximately 70% increase over the same span. Analysts currently expect earnings of $0.83 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion for the latest quarter, versus $1.04 per share on revenue of $964 million a year ago. From a fundamentals angle, CrowdStrike’s market capitalization stands at $104 billion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $4.1 billion in revenue but was not operationally profitable, with operating losses of $252 million and a net loss of $172 million. That being said, if you prefer upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk tactic (though not helpful if correlations are weak) is to study relationships between short-term and medium-term moves after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and trade accordingly. For example, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest link, a trader could lean “long” for the following 5 days when the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data using a 5-year history and a more recent 3-year window. Here, 1D_5D denotes the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. At times, peer outcomes can influence post-earnings reactions—sometimes even before the report as expectations get priced in. The chart below compares CrowdStrike’s past post-earnings one-day (1D) returns with peers that reported just ahead of CrowdStrike. Peer returns also reflect post-earnings 1D moves for a fair comparison.

Title: Bitcoin’s Volatility Drops as It Matures, Setting the Stage for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale to Explode
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-matures-volatility-drops-bitcoin-hyper-presale-explodes/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T12:01:41Z
Full Content:
Believe it or not, Bitcoin’s volatility has hit a five-year low, even as its price rockets to new highs and then takes a breather. The world’s first crypto is starting to act a lot more grown-up. The crazy price swings that it was famous for are now a thing of the past. For years, Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations scared potential investors. But it now seems less jumpy than a big tech stock. According to recent data, Bitcoin’s volatility has been lower than even Wall Street giants like Nvidia since 2022. This shift shows a big change in how the market sees Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Lyn Alden even thinks this current bull run will be ‘less extreme’ and last longer. We might see more steady climbs and periods of instability instead of the usual ‘to the moon and then crash’ pattern, she explains in a recent interview for CryptoSlate. Bitcoin is finally settling down and acting like a legitimate financial asset. So, why is Bitcoin suddenly so chill? A big reason is the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. back in early 2024. These new, regulated products, offered by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, made it super easy for everyday people and big institutions to get into Bitcoin. With more people and more money flowing in, the market became a lot more stable, smoothing out those wild price swings. Another factor is that you can now put Bitcoin in your 401(k) retirement account. As big-money players like pension funds and insurance companies start adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, the asset becomes less vulnerable to short-term speculators. This means less drama and more stability. Bitcoin is also starting to move in sync with the broader stock market, which is another huge sign that it’s officially part of the mainstream. For both casual investors and institutions, this lower volatility means less risk and a smoother ride. It proves Bitcoin is officially leaving its rebellious teenage phase behind and settling into its role as a key player in the financial world. Its promising blockchain upscaling soltuion and an explosive presale nearing $12M are the main reasons why we think it’s one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The team behind Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) saw the many challenges faced by $BTC and decided to build a powerful new layer to upgrade the OG. Bitcoin is a legend, but it’s got some major hang-ups. While it was a revolutionary idea, it was never built for the lightning-fast, high-tech world we live in now. Its transactions are painfully slow, it’s not programmable for modern protocols like you see on Ethereum and Solana, and the fees can get pretty high when the network’s busy. Enter Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2: fully programable for DeFi thanks to integrating the Solana Virtual Machine; maintaining trustless cross-chain transfers and secure settlement on Bitcoin’s network. Their goal? To transform Bitcoin from a simple digital asset into a full-blown platform for innovation, all while keeping that rock-solid security that Bitcoin is famous for. Right now, the token sells for $0.012795. However, our $HYPER price prediction sees a potential $0.32 high by the end of 2025. Check $HYPER to lock 2,400% potential ROI. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s bottlenecks, but it’s not the first L2 project to attempt this. So, what makes it unique? It’s the Solana Virtual Machine integration. This add-on basically brings the insane speed and low latency of Solana to the Bitcoin world. It’s a simple but powerful change that brings Bitcoin up to modern standards. This means developers can finally create super-fast, scalable dApps on a network that’s still backed by Bitcoin’s security. That’s how Bitcoin Hyper acts as a high-performance Layer 2 chain, handling transactions at warp speed and then settling them on the main Bitcoin network later. This setup keeps costs low and speed high without clogging up the original chain. Another staple is the Canonical Bridge. It’s a decentralized bridge that lets you move your Bitcoin from the main chain to the Layer 2 easily and securely. Once your $BTC is on the new layer, you can use it for virtually everything, from quick payments to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms. Thanks to this new system, Bitcoin is becoming a dynamic platform ready for the future. Our full guide to What is Bitcoin Hyper covers its roadmap and features in even more detail. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale for 93% APY. Bitcoin’s story is about growing up. It’s moving on from being that wild, rebellious teenager to a more stable and serious adult in the financial world. A major part of it is thanks to big-time players getting involved with things like ETFs and retirement accounts. With Hyper’s help, Bitcoin isn’t just ‘digital gold’ you stick in a vault anymore. It’s becoming a versatile platform ready to power a whole new wave of apps. Remember to do your own research and invest wisely. This article isn’t financial advice.

Title: Forbes Daily: The U.S. Takes Unusual $10 Billion Tech Stake In Intel
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/08/25/forbes-daily-the-us-takes-unusual-10-billion-tech-stake-in-intel/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T11:56:00Z
Full Content:
ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled long-awaited rate cuts could be coming, the world’s wealthiest became even richer. Powell’s comments at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming spurred a broader stock market rally, as lower rates are expected to jolt the economy. The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, gained $9.3 billion in net worth, bringing his total to around $417 billion on Friday, while the second-wealthiest, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, got a $4.4 billion boost. President Donald Trump has demanded a rate cut, but Powell warned that despite U.S. economic resilience, tariffs could “spur a more lasting inflation dynamic.” In an unusual move for the federal government, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will take a 10% stake in Intel worth roughly $10 billion, making it the third-largest shareholder in the struggling chipmaker. It’s one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade, when the U.S. injected billions of funds into automakers during the 2008 financial crisis. Judges in two courts have now found that the president of the United States took part in a yearslong fraud that deceived financial institutions about his net worth, but they differed on how much Trump should pay as a penalty. Last week, appellate justice Peter Moulton reduced Trump’s roughly $500 million penalty imposed by a judge in February to zero. Neither did much math to arrive at those numbers. MORE: The wiping out of Trump’s fine was also a win for billionaire Don Hankey, whose specialty insurance firm put up a $175 million bond for Trump last year while he was appealing the ruling. While Trump and Hankey had never met or directly done deals, Hankey, worth $7.8 billion, confirmed to Forbes last year that he supported Trump’s political campaigns and was the largest individual owner of the lender that refinanced mortgages for some of Trump’s properties. Most people invest in an index fund to diversify their portfolio—but when it comes to the benchmark S&P 500 these days, 28% of the value of the index is in just five stocks: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta, all of which have high price tags. To take a step back from the S&P 500, investors can instead purchase a total market fund, blend U.S. and foreign stocks, purchase bonds or consider ETFs that hold small- and mid-cap stocks. President Donald Trump said he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, as a Trump Administration official has accused her of mortgage fraud. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleges Cook claimed two properties as her primary residence, but Cook has denied wrongdoing and said the mortgage application was from before she joined the Fed. The billionaire owner of OnlyFans is now worth $7.8 billion, double Forbes’ estimate from a year ago, as he earned more than $1.9 million a day from the site in 2024. And Leonid Radvinsky may be in for his biggest payout yet, as he is reportedly in talks to sell OnlyFans in a deal that would value the company at about $8 billion. President Donald Trump suggested he could again delay the deadline for TikTok to secure a U.S. buyer or face a ban. Trump called the national security concerns over the app owned by Chinese company ByteDance “highly overrated,” and suggested there are buyers lined up for TikTok. MORE: Even as TikTok continues to face the threat of a ban in the U.S., its business is growing elsewhere in the world. Outside the U.S., TikTok saw its revenues surge 38% to $6.3 billion last year, though it’s facing a litany of lawsuits and investigations from regulators globally. The theme park industry, like the broader travel sector, is on a bit of a roller coaster ride this year: Data shows that overall spending at U.S. theme parks was down 5% this summer compared to last year, mostly driven by a pullback from low- and middle-income parkgoers. Meanwhile, pricier destination theme parks run by Disney and Universal got a boost from affluent visitors, a trend mirrored in the rest of the industry. These days, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, America’s best-known pothead entertainers, are playing by the rules, as long as you ignore the federal laws regarding marijuana. In 2020, the duo, along with their business partners, launched two companies, California-based Cheech and Chong Cannabis Co., which licenses its brand, genetics, formulas and retail designs to marijuana companies, and Cheech and Chong’s Global Holding Company, a Nevada-based endeavor that sells hemp-derived products ranging from gummies to THC-infused drinks. In 2025, the companies’ combined revenue will hit nearly $100 million from both marijuana and hemp, up from about $50 million last year. The companies, which outsource manufacturing to third parties, are worth roughly $150 million. And as the U.S. cannabis market posted $32 billion in sales last year across 40 states, Cheech and Chong, if anybody, deserve a taste of the action. The pair are the godfathers of the stoner comedy genre thanks to Up In Smoke, their 1978 debut film followed by Nice Dreams and other movies, all of which influenced generations of films from Dave Chappelle’s Half Baked to Seth Rogen’s Pineapple Express. Celebrity cannabis brands do not typically do well, other than a few exceptions such as Mike Tyson’s Tyson 2.0 and Wiz Khalifa’s Khalifa Kush. But Cheech and Chong have a unique advantage—not only are they synonymous with weed, but they also have a massive fan base that spans generations. WHY IT MATTERS “Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong have been making people laugh for decades, but their cannabis business is no joke,” says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. “With $100 million in combined revenue from their companies that sell marijuana and hemp products, Cheech and Chong are standouts when it comes to celebrity-founded cannabis companies. The duo’s fame and influence spans decades—from their 1978 debut film Up In Smoke to That 70s Show to Zootopia. While most celebrity weed brands flounder on the market, Cheech and Chong have built a strong brand with impressive sales within five years.” MORE The Kings Of CBD Are Now Cooking Up Plans To Make Billion-Dollar Meds From Cannabis And Mushrooms The gap between the earnings of workers and CEOs among the lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 is growing, according to a report from the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies. The report found CEO pay is rising more than twice as quickly as that of the average worker: 12.9%: How much the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio widened between 2019 and 2024 6,666 to 1: Last year’s pay ratio gap at Starbucks, the company with the largest such disparity in the S&P 500 32: The number of billionaires who owe their wealth directly to companies in the Low-Wage 100, the S&P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay Gen Z is facing one of the worst job markets in recent history, but if you apply the right strategy to your search, it’s still possible to secure an offer. Branch out beyond jobs related only to your college degree, you might find possibilities you hadn’t considered. Don’t be afraid to pivot, and try to target recession-proof industries. A retail business that previously went bankrupt and closed its stores nationwide is planning a comeback, with 300 new locations in the works. What chain is it? A. Party City B. Bed Bath & Beyond C.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$111,964.98 has retraced to roughly where it was before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks on Friday, which briefly sparked a rally in U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reversal in BTC price has paused ether’s rally and triggered losses across the broader altcoin market. The CoinDesk 20 (CD 20) Index is down 3% on a 24-hour basis, while the broader CoinDesk 80 (CD 80) index has fallen 3.74% as of writing. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, noted that liquidity appears to be shifting from bitcoin into altcoins. “Bitcoin is trading at $112,000, having fallen to a low of $110,000—its weakest level since early July. Friday’s surge attracted fresh sellers, pushing BTC below its 50-day moving average. So far, liquidity seems to be migrating from BTC to Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana. However, we cannot rule out that this is a precursor, with Bitcoin potentially starting a ‘sell-on-rise’ phase that may soon extend to altcoins,” Kuptsikevich said in an email. Adding to the narrative, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a prominent bitcoin whale, who received 100,000 BTC a long while ago, began diversifying into ether over the weekend. Singapore-based QCP Capital chimed in with a longer-term perspective, stating, “Near term, BTC appears to be ceding momentum to ETH, but our structural outlook on Bitcoin remains optimistic. Similar to July’s absorption of roughly 80,000 BTC of legacy supply, we expect institutions to continue buying dips selectively.” Highlighting institutional interest in dip buying, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet announced the acquisition of an additional 103 BTC, raising its holdings to 18,991 BTC. These developments come on the heels of Japan’s Finance Minister endorsing regulated crypto assets as a legitimate diversification tool within broader portfolios. On the derivatives front, the price swings since Friday have sparked notable activity. Hyperliquid, an on-chain perpetual futures platform, announced hitting a new 24-hour all-time high spot volume of $3.4 billion, driven largely by rises in BTC and ETH deposits. The exchange now ranks as the second largest venue for spot BTC trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges, with $1.5 billion in 24-hour BTC volume alone. This surge reflects the growing traction of specialized blockchain-based trading ecosystems. Meanwhile, in traditional markets, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) edged up 0.22% to 97.94 following a near 1% decline on Friday. Gold prices remained flat, while European stocks and S&P 500 futures traded lower, indicating a measured degree of investor risk aversion. Stay alert!

Title: Five Ways To Avoid The Five Hottest Stocks

ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Indexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks. The affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically. Herewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond. Index investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That’s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund’s position in Nvidia. But history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today’s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26. Here are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You’re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing. Replace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX. Without a Fidelity account you’re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT. The total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000. You can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder. In lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad. VT’s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you’ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings. Instead of accepting Vanguard’s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio. There are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia. There are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender. Over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, “cheap” is synonymous with “high-yielding.” In August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That’s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond. There are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long. If you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470. These numbers are bit confusing, so here’s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That’s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity. Long Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond’s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today’s tippy toppy S&P 500.

Title: Irish beaches at cleanest in eight years, litter survey finds
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2025/08/25/irish-beaches-at-cleanest-in-eight-years-litter-survey-finds/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T07:25:33Z

Irish beaches are at their cleanest in eight years, according to Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL). The group’s latest survey of Ireland’s coasts and inland waterways, conducted by An Taisce for the business group, awarded 17 of 33 the beaches, harbours and rivers monitored clean status. The result marks a 50 per cent improvement on the last survey despite the warm weather this summer bringing large numbers to the coast. The number of areas classified as littered dropped from 11 to three, with cigarette butts, sweet papers and fast food wrappers the most commonly found discarded items. Sites falling into this category are Dingle Harbour in Co Kerry; Dog’s Bay beach in Co Galway; and White Bay Beach in Co Cork. Among the popular sites to be awarded clean status were Brittas Bay in Co Wicklow; Curracloe in Co Wexford; Bundoran in Co Donegal; Killiney in Co Dublin; Strandhill in Co Sligo; and Tramore in Co Waterford. None of the sites surveyed were placed in the lowest category: heavily littered. Portmarnock in Co Dublin registered a dramatic improvement on its previous ‘littered’ rating, while similar improvement was noted at Blackrock Castle and Castletownbere in Co Cork. However, Dingle experienced a demotion to littered, as did Dog’s Bay beach and White Bay. “This is by far the most favourable result we have seen in eight years of coastal surveys,” said Conor Horgan of IBAL. “The Trojan and ever-expanding work of clean coasts groups and other volunteers is instrumental in this, as is the investment by councils in facilities around our beaches.” Legislative measures such as the tethering of caps to plastic bottles and the deposit return scheme have contributed to the improvement, IBAL said. The first coastal survey conducted since the introduction of the deposit return scheme shows a 30 per cent drop in the volume of these items being discarded. Under the scheme customers pay a refundable deposit on plastic bottles and cans and claim a credit when they return the bottle or can to a reverse-vending machine. Vapes were less prevalent than in previous studies, but coffee cup litter remained high, with cups found in 42 per cent of surveyed sites. “The coffee cup levy seems to have died with the last government, but these findings show that the case for it has not died,” said Mr Horgan, adding that coastal areas would benefit from a coffee cup-free policy similar to Killarney’s model. In 2022, the Co Kerry town became the first town in Ireland to phase out single-use coffee cups. An Taisce’s annual call to action – the Big Beach Clean Up – is expected to attract more than 600 groups and 15,000 volunteers nationwide to Irish beaches from September 19th to 21st.

Headed to the beach this month? Chances are you’ll make a visit. A bracing swim, some fish and chips and a 99 are just the traditions to round out an Irish summer. But there’s something else you could make part of your beach routine and that’s a two-minute beach clean. This practice can go a long way towards making our beaches better. You’ll see all kinds of litter on a day at the beach. From food packaging and broken toys to discarded vapes and fishing and boating paraphernalia, marine litter comes from all sorts of land- and sea-based activities. What we see on the beach is only part of the problem, according to Beaches.ie, an initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is estimated that 15 per cent of marine litter ends up on the sand, 15 per cent floats in the water and 70 per cent rests on the seabed. This stuff doesn’t just spoil the beauty of our beaches, it can harm marine life and their habitats too. Plastic litter kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles worldwide every year. This includes 30,000 seals and up to a million seabirds, who either get entangled in it or eat it, according to Beaches.ie. In some areas, plastic accounts for 80 per cent of the litter and can remain in the marine environment for hundreds of years. That’s a day at the beach that isn’t getting forgotten any time soon. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy. Initiatives such as the #2MinuteBeachClean, operated as part of An Taisce’s Clean Coasts programme and supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Heritage is one way we can help stop the tide of litter. Spending just two minutes picking up the things we see at the beach can make a big difference. Not only will it make the beach a nicer place to be, but every piece of litter removed is a piece of litter that won’t pollute our oceans or be ingested by marine life. Taking just two minutes, each #2MinuteBeachClean is estimated to collect about 1-2kg of litter. If everybody in Ireland did a #2MinuteBeachClean per month, that would be more than 100,000 tonnes of litter removed from our ocean this year. Blue Flag beaches have #2minutebeachclean stations with bags and litter pickers you can borrow to make it easier to help keep our beaches litter free. You could do as some others are doing and take a photo of the litter and post it on social media (X or Instagram using the #2minutebeachclean) before putting the litter in the bin. [ Plastic colonialism: ‘A stream of plastic debris, stretching miles, is heading towards us’Opens in new window ] Search the #2minutebeachclean hashtag and you’ll find groups such as the Tomhaggard Clean Coasts group in Wexford, which removed 25 bags of waste at Carnsore in July. Their finds included a tyre and a lobster pot. Some 10 volunteers from the Blackrock Clean Up in Cork group gathered 11 bags of litter on one of the hottest days of the year. Clean Coasts Ballynamona, also in Cork, brought pupils from four primary schools to Garrylucas Beach in June. They gathered litter and learned about the importance of keeping their local beaches clean. Finds from two-minute beach cleaners include everything from a Die Hard DVD in Donabate to a Child of Prague statue, buried in the sand. So next time you visit the beach, whether you are going for a swim or walking the dog, think about joining the growing movement of people who are reducing marine litter, two minutes at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Publisher Payment Plans; The Details Of Retail Data Deals

A Change Of Heart Publishers are hopeful that Meta may have changed its tune at least somewhat when it comes to how – or whether – the platform reimburses publishers for content contributed to its LLM models. Following up on an IAB Tech Lab event at which Meta and Google participated alongside publishers, Digiday reports on cautious optimism among pubs that Meta’s recent hiring spree of AI engineering leaders has led to a greater appreciation of the value of original written content. That’s quite a different vibe than Meta was putting out there as recently as last year. Last September, on The Verge’s Decoder podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content.” Reading between the lines, if creators don’t want to participate in feeding AI models because they’re not being properly compensated, then maybe the AI models will just skip over them. Although, not to be a cynic, that might be a moot point, considering all the data scraping that’s been going on. Also, we’ll believe it when we see it – publicly. “They [Meta] were very clear that their stance on this has changed,” one anonymous publisher tells Digiday. “Even though it may not have outwardly turned into action yet.” Data (Fee) Leak Times are tough for The Trade Desk. Its stock price sank after investors questioned its strategy for competing with walled gardens. Meanwhile, competitors are gunning for their slices of open web advertising and the growing CTV and retail media markets. Now, a document leak has revealed what advertisers pay for targeting data sourced from TTD’s retail media partners, Adweek reports. The document, which was last updated June 15, also includes the minimum ad spend required to create custom audiences or conduct campaign measurement using retailer data. When advertisers use retail media data to target ads, they pay the retailer a percentage of the campaign’s CPM capped at a set amount. For example, targeting with Costco’s data might cost 40% of the CPM, but won’t exceed $4 per 1,000 impressions. It’s unclear whether TTD keeps a portion of the data fees for itself. The hard caps are in place because CPMs are much higher for CTV ad buys than online display campaigns, and retail media data is commonly used for CTV targeting. The leak also sheds light on TTD’s no-longer-exclusive ad tech partnership with Walmart’s DSP, including a $150,000 spending minimum and a 75-cent CPM fee for sales lift measurement. However, Walmart says those are old figures, so it’ll be interesting to see what other DSPs will charge for Walmart’s data. Giving Privacy The Finger Fingerprinting has a bad reputation. But opinions on the controversial tracking strategy seem to be shifting. The IAB Tech Lab is even defending it. Audience fingerprinting identifies and tracks devices or users based on unique digital traits like browser settings and software and hardware configurations, without relying on cookies or device IDs. A fingerprint can include everything from web browser type and version, a device’s operating system, the size of the screen, language settings and many other signals. Platforms combine these data points, none of which alone can specifically identify a person, to create a probabilistic user ID. Critics say fingerprinting threatens user privacy, since people can’t opt out. Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and others prohibit the practice. But Google, which also once banned fingerprinting, reversed course back in January. And now the IAB Tech Lab is also waving away concerns. At the AdMonsters Sell Side Summit in Nashville last week, Tech Lab CEO Anthony Katsur gave a rundown of the trade org’s recent initiatives, including its new Trusted Server framework. In describing how the server uses first-party data to create synthetic IDs, Katsur acknowledged, but also diminished, criticisms that the framework promotes fingerprinting – perhaps drawing on his tense exchange with Sincera’s Mike O’Sullivan in March. “Oh, it’s fingerprinting,” he said in a mocking tone. “Sure, let’s fucking call it fingerprinting.” You heard the man! But Wait! There’s More! Publishers sing the AI scraping blues and detail their diversification efforts at Sell Side Summit Nashville. [AdMonsters] OpenAI has been using data from Google search results to power ChatGPT. [The Information] A sign of the times: Digg, once billed as the “front page of the internet,” is relaunching as an app-focused experience. [The Verge] Y Combinator claims that Apple’s App Store has hindered startup growth. [TechCrunch] And now for something that anyone with a social media account already knows: AI is bad at moderating online communities. [Bloomberg] Nostalgia for a simpler, algorithm-free internet is at an all-time high. [Business Insider] You’re Hired!

Title: Faraday Future Founder and Co-CEO YT Jia Shares Weekly Investor Update

August 24, 2025 23:54 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “This is our 17th weekly update. Many of you have asked whether our “Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge” eco-strategy could lead to distraction or drift. In fact, it is the opposite. This is not about losing focus, but about strengthening our foundation. Automaking is a long-cycle, high-investment, and slow-return industry. One of the core challenges FF is facing is that: before hitting positive operating cash flow, how do promote long-term and stable capital supply. Our C10 Treasury is designed for this. By accumulating and compounding the world’s Top 10 crypto coin portfolio, it has the potential to provide continuous and sustained capital support for our main business — EAI EV, truly delivering dual-engine growth from both capital and industry.” On Friday last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut may come as early as September. His remarks gave a major boost to capital markets. U.S. equities moved higher, while crypto reacted faster and stronger. The market priced in liquidity easing more directly, creating a clear upside for our C10 Treasury, as the C10 Index was up nearly 6% on Friday. This week, both flywheels achieved important progress: On S1 User Ecosystem: The influence of our “Dual Flywheel + Dual Bridge” unveiling event continues to grow in the U.S. It has sparked meta-chemistry. Cross-sector outreach in automotive, finance, and Web3 created a multi-domain resonance. As a result, FF and FX received cross-industry attention that far exceeded expectations. We will double our efforts to quickly elevate FF and FX’s influence in the U.S. market to another level. Looking at S2–S3: Product & Technology:This week, FX Super One successfully completed the first round of development tests for occupant upper interior impact protection under U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). FMVSS is recognized as one of the world’s most complete and rigorous automotive safety regulations. It is a prerequisite for entering the U.S. market and also sets standards for automotive design, manufacturing, and testing worldwide. FX Super One must meet the requirements of the U.S., the Middle East, and future global markets. This requires testing at the highest standards. We will continue advancing vehicle testing, development, and validation to build a strong foundation for Super One’s high safety standards. Moving on to S4, Product Execution & Delivery: This week, we visited the Hanford manufacturing facility to oversee FX Super One’s trial production. Thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing team, around 60% of the trial production process planning has already been completed. Next, the team will continue comprehensive validation of production processes, refine work procedures, establish and enhance the quality control system, and carry out dedicated skill training in parallel. Lastly, on S5 Capital Markets and finance:The first dedicated $30 million financing commitment for C10 Treasury closed this week. We expect to begin the first round of asset allocation next week. Our plan is to gradually deploy the full $30 million over the coming weeks. 80% will be allocated passively according to the C10 Index, while 20% will be actively managed. We will share portfolio holdings and performance updates in future weekly reports. C10 Treasury, as a short-cycle, fast-paced, high-value, and cash-cow investment due to steady staking interests, could serve as the financial engine of the entire listed company FFAI, and help accelerate the implementation and execution of the EAI EV strategy. Next week:Our Super One co-creation and sales campaign will officially kick off across eight U.S. states. Over the next weekend, I will make a short trip to the Nevada desert, bringing FX Super One to Burning Man. We also plan to announce an important update there. Burning Man has become a global utopia where leading minds in technology, art, and business pursue creativity and idealism. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are regulars there, and Google’s founders once recruited Eric Schmidt at Burning Man. Schmidt went on to lead Google for a decade, driving its rapid expansion and cementing Google’s dominance in the Web2 era. Starting August 28, Super One will also make its debut in Massachusetts, where we and our FF Par partners will host two consecutive co-creation and sales events in the Boston area. At the same time, our New York–based B2B partner Alps will launch a week-long roadshow campaign. On August 30, FF headquarters will host a special event — the inaugural North America “Go-Global Stand-Up Comedy Festival” and FX Super One Showcase. Joe Wong, the first Chinese stand-up comedian to have roasted a U.S. president live at the White House, will join entrepreneurs, founders, and global expansion pioneers for co-creation and exchange. We will see you next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Business FILE PHOTO: Mizuho Bank's signboard is pictured in Tokyo, Japan, January 25, 2017. Picture taken January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File photo LONDON/TOKYO :Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are targeting buying or partnering with overseas money managers, they told Reuters, joining other Japanese financial companies aiming for a larger share of the global investing market. Mizuho is prioritising a tie-up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing, an executive told Reuters. MUFG, meanwhile, has identified overseas asset management - particularly in the United States and Europe - as a priority area for potential deals, the company said. The banks, two of the largest in Japan, collectively manage about $1.3 trillion through their asset management arms, largely for local clients. They declined to comment on whether discussions with target companies had already taken place and there is no certainty transactions will happen.

Title: Dow eyes fresh highs as Nvidia gets set to report earnings amid AI bubble fears

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Stock futures edged up on Sunday evening as Wall Street looks ahead to another big week that will feature earnings from AI chip leader Nvidia and another inflation update. Markets are coming off a monster rally on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a rate cut next month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.05%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.06%. On Friday, the Dow hit a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in on their records. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.256% after diving Friday on rate-cut expectations. The U.S. dollar was down 0.02% against the euro and flat against the yen. Gold fell 0.13% to $3,413.80 per ounce. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2% to $63.79 per barrel, and Brent crude added 0.15% to reach $67.83. Friday’s stock surge came after a big selloff that was led by tech giants, as doubts have grown about the AI boom and how much it will actually help companies. That’s after a recent report from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs at businesses are failing to produce much of a return. Adding to those concerns were remarks from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble. Wall Street’s faith in the staying power of AI as an investment thesis will be put to the test when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday. The report also comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to an unprecedented deal where they give the federal government a 15% cut of their chip sales to China. For now, demand from U.S. companies remains high as so-called hyperscaler tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms alone are expected to deploy $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, and most of that is going to AI. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is due as policymakers wait and see how much of an effect on inflation President Donald Trump’s tariffs are having. Earlier updates on the consumer price index and the producer price index were mixed, and analysts expect the personal consumption expenditures index for July to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a yearly basis, the same annual rate as June. But the core PCE is seen climbing 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on a yearly basis, accelerating from June’s 2.8% annual rate. Still, some Fed officials, including Powell, have indicated that tariff-related impacts on inflation may be short-term and that more attention should go to the labor market, which has shown signs of weakening. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin volatility keeps falling, and that means it’s maturing as an asset class

Bitcoin volatility has dropped to a five-year low as the number-one crypto matures, showing more price predictability than blue-chip tech stocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The world’s number-one crypto is looking more like a mature asset class every day as Bitcoin volatility continues to drop (yes, even as it blasts past all-time highs and promptly retraces its steps). Bitcoin has long been regarded as one of the most volatile financial assets; its turbulent price fluctuations over the years have deterred many investors. But what if I told you that Bitcoin is now less volatile than a blue-chip tech stock? According to ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility is now at its lowest point in nearly five years, and it’s a trend that has persisted even through Bitcoin’s headline-making rallies and corrections over the last five years: “Exactly what you expect from a maturing asset.” Since 2022, Bitcoin has often been less volatile than some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including mega-cap stocks like Nvidia. During the sharp tech sector swings of 2023 and 2024, Nvidia’s price was more unpredictable than Bitcoin, an asset infamous for its hair-raising moves. Even during this current Bitcoin bull run, the price swings have remained notably tamer than previous cycles. Macro analyst Lyn Alden recently told CryptoSlate she believes that Bitcoin’s cycles are changing. We should expect this one to be longer and “less extreme” than previous runs, with strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” Bitcoin volatility declining is just one marker of its growing maturity. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in early 2024 was a landmark event, opening up the asset to the mainstream audience. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offer direct Bitcoin exposure to retail and institutional investors through regulated exchange-traded products. This has introduced broader ownership and liquidity, dampening large price swings and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into traditional markets. Moreover, recent regulatory changes now allow Americans to include Bitcoin in their 401k retirement accounts. As diversified portfolios absorb BTC allocations, Bitcoin volatility further subsides. Pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies have begun allocating to Bitcoin as part of their alternative asset strategies. This increases trading by sophisticated investors and reduces the impact of short-term speculative flows. Increasingly, Bitcoin’s price shows a higher correlation with broader equity markets during risk-on and risk-off periods, another sign of integration and maturity. While you can argue whether this is what we intended for Bitcoin, it does reflect mainstream market adoption. And hey, strong-willed kids become adults who change the world, as Bitcoin is undoubtedly doing. For everyday investors and institutions alike, lower Bitcoin volatility translates to less risk and a smoother investment profile. It’s also a sign that Bitcoin is outgrowing its adolescent phase of wild speculative swings and turbulence, and settling into its role as a legitimate member of society and staple of diversified portfolios.

Title: Wall Street Can’t Stand This 12%-Yielding Bear Portfolio

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Let’s talk about three dividends averaging 12%. I bring them up because everyone on Wall Street hates them. This is notable because the suits are paid to be bullish. Sell calls are rare, especially among S&P 500 stocks. In fact, analysts shun just one index component today! Buy calls? They are numerous—405 out of 500. Eighty-one percent! Are 81% of the companies in the S&P 500 really buys? Normally, no, but now—especially not. AI is disrupting business models and many of these Buy-rated names are doomed companies. Here’s another problem with Buy ratings—there is no room for improvement. Sells are better. They set the stage for upgrades! And it doesn’t take much for analysts to flip a stock from a Sell to a Buy. Which is why savvy contrarians dig through the Sell bin. Today we’ll discuss three hated names yielding from 6.1% to 15.7%. Before getting to those, let’s use Prospect Capital (PSEC, 18.7% yield), as a cautionary tale and highlight the difference between being contrarian and being foolish. PSEC is a business development company (BDC) that provides capital to middle-market companies, primarily through first lien and other secured debt. It has a diverse portfolio of 114 companies across 33 industries. And it’s one of the largest BDCs at well more than $1 billion in market cap. But despite being a monthly dividend payer with a yield that could be confused for a credit card APR, and despite being the cheapest BDC on the market, Wall Street can’t find a reason to like it. It has just two covering analysts, and only one of them has a rating on the stock (Sell, unsurprisingly). While that smacks of too small a sample size, the lack of coverage itself is telling. Research firms would prefer not to bite the hands that provide them with access, to the point where many would choose to temporarily stop covering a company over calling a spade a spade. Why the lack of love? Among other reasons, how about three dividend cuts in the past decade, including a 25% reduction less than a year ago. All right. What about a BDC with a slightly less bearish camp? BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC, 15.7% yield) is technically a consensus Sell call, but the majority of analysts covering it say it’s a Hold. So at least as far as pro ratings go, it’s not a disaster. TCPC is a middle-market lender that prefers companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. It currently boasts more than 150 portfolio companies across 20 different industries, and its deal mix is heaviest (82%) in first-lien debt, and the vast majority (94%) of its lending is floating-rate in nature. The case for BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. is BlackRock. The BDC is externally managed by a BlackRock subsidiary, which gives it access to BlackRock resources. In theory, that should make TCPC competitive. Again, the pros likely have a legitimate case here. TCPC is in the process of restructuring deals amid credit issues in the portfolio, and management fees have been waived to make up for some of the financial slack. The dividend—which BlackRock TPC cut earlier this year, just a few months after I flagged the potentially brewing trouble in its distribution—isn’t necessarily at risk yet, but it bears watching if portfolio losses continue. Hated BDCs might be asking for it. Let’s look at other high-yield acronyms instead. Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP, 6.1% yield) is a midstream subsidiary of Cheniere Energy (LNG). It owns the Sabine Pass LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal in Louisiana, which includes natural gas liquefaction facilities and regasification facilities. It also owns the Creole Trail Pipelines, which connects the Sabine Pass terminal with inter- and intrastate pipelines. Cheniere Partners owns the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which has natural gas liquefaction facilities with a total production capacity of over 30 mtpa of LNG. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks, vaporizers, and three marine berths. Cheniere Partners also owns a Corpus Christi liquefaction facility and a connected pipeline, as well as Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate and intrastate pipelines. CQP is pouring itself into expansions at its Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi facilities—big capital outlays that required Cheniere to reduce its variable distribution in 2024. That payout came up a smidge earlier this year, however, and the company’s underperformance last year has turned into more respectable performance this year. There’s no telling what the master limited partnership (MLP) will do in the short term as its various project details are fleshed out. But if these projects do bear fruit, CQP could be looking at a potential explosion of distributable cash flow (DCF) generation a few years down the road. How about a real estate investment trust (REIT)? Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR, 14.4% yield), a REIT tied to the marijuana industry, is what I call a “bearish Hold.” Most of the pros say it’s a Hold or a Sell, but a lone Buy call raises its consensus average. Still, Wall Street really doesn’t like this stock—a massive change of fortune to a stock that over the past decade has been among both the sector’s biggest success stories and its biggest flops. IIPR provides capital for the regulated cannabis industry through a sale-leaseback program. It buys freestanding industrial and retail properties (most of which are marijuana growth facilities) from cannabis operators, then leases them right back to the sellers. This provides cannabis operators with much-needed influxes of cash that they can use to expand their operations, and provides the REIT with ongoing cash flow. Currently, IIPR owns 108 properties in 19 states, representing nearly 9 million square feet, which it leases out to 36 tenants. It’s not like Innovative Industrial Properties has operationally reverted to where it was 10 years ago—not even close. The company went public in 2016 and generated negative $7.5 million in funds from operations (FFO). It has cleared $210 million in FFO in each of the past three years, including $231 million in 2023 and $230 million in 2024. However, the stock exploded even more than the business did, and the past few years have seen shares come back to earth. And everything’s not exactly rosy in the core business, which still is dealing with a cracked, state-by-state regulatory environment. That’s a big reason why IIPR recently invested $270 million into IQHQ, a life science real estate platform with more than $2 billion in assets—a move that could provide much-needed stability and growth. It’s worth noting, however, that FFO has been declining significantly over the past few quarters, driving its adjusted FFO payout ratio to nearly 95%; that’s uncomfortably higher than the 85% ratio IIPR averaged between 2017 and 2024.

Title: Ripple’s XRP Breaks Into Top 100 Global Assets With $180 Billion Market Cap

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple’s XRP has officially broken into the top 100 global assets by market capitalization, a milestone that places it alongside some of the world’s most valuable companies like Shopify, Intuit, and Deutsche Telekom. According to the latest data, XRP holds a market cap of around $181.2 billion at a price of $3.02 per token, ranking it above 100th on the global leaderboard. More notably, XRP has managed to join this exclusive list without the backing of a regulated spot ETF in the United States, unlike its crypto counterparts Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are also on the list of the largest global assets. At the time of writing, XRP is the 97th largest asset by market cap, the third cryptocurrency in the list behind Bitcoin at 7th and Ethereum at 22nd. XRP’s climb to this milestone can be traced to a wave of inflows that have been pouring into the asset in recent months. The scale of these inflows has been enough to push XRP’s market cap above BNB and stablecoin Tether USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Institutional and retail investors have been drawn to XRP following the conclusion of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This confidence, combined with the larger crypto market bullishness, has seen the XRP price establish a new support base at $3. Crossing into the ranks of the world’s top 100 assets shows how XRP is faring compared to companies outside the cryptocurrency market. At its current valuation, XRP is now on the tails of some of the most recognized global corporations, like Verizon, Texas Instruments, Shopify, and Intuit. Top assets by market cap: CompaniesMarketCap Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained tremendous institutional traction in the past 18 months or so through the launch of regulated spot ETFs in the United States. XRP, on the other hand, has reached its current standing without such an instrument. Therefore, XRP’s present milestone may be just the start of a much larger climb. The absence of ETF-driven inflows means that XRP has significant untapped potential waiting to be unlocked through financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale once regulatory approval for a Spot XRP ETF arrives in the US. Such a trading instrument would open the door for large-scale institutional investors who have so far been restricted in accessing XRP exposure. If the same inflow patterns seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are seen again with XRP, its market capitalization could easily push past its current peers in the top 100 global asset rankings alongside its price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.04. Expectations tied to the eventual approval of Spot XRP ETFs stretch from moderate projections of $4 to ambitious forecasts of as high as $1,000.

Title: ETFs and 401(k)s Don’t Play. Could Dual Share Classes Change That?

Intraday trading and other ETF features aren’t designed for 401(k)s, but mutual fund share classes could give ETF issuers an in. At least one shop has hopes for that. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com If ETFs were a square peg, 401(k)s might be round holes — round holes with perimeters guarded by motion-sensing lasers, trapdoors and werewolves. They simply aren’t getting in. At least, not as standalone investment options on plan menus. It’s a roughly $12 trillion market that is off limits, with a couple of exceptions: Some defined-contribution plans have brokerage windows that few investors use; and some plans include asset-allocation products that have exposure to ETFs. For a lot of asset managers, it’s not really a problem, as they provide strategies in a range of vehicles, including mutual funds, ETFs and collective investment trusts. But for companies whose focus is on ETFs, it’s a missed opportunity. “ETFs are really made for the retail market,” said Greg Ungerman, head of defined contribution research and consulting at Callan. “There are a lot of tax advantages vis-à-vis a mutual fund.” ETFs’ tax benefits don’t matter within tax-deferred plans like 401(k)s. And while ETFs offer low costs, the institutional-level pricing of mutual fund shares and CITs in defined-contribution plans is extremely hard to compete with. For example, Ungerman said, the bargain-price 9 basis-point fee for the $650 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has nothing on the comparable index funds available to defined-contribution plans for 1 basis point or less. Some of the other hindrances include: It wasn’t always this way. There was some excitement about the potential for ETFs in 401(k)s as much as 20 years ago, just before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed everything. Unlike many mutual funds at the time, ETFs, still far less common than they are today, had “clean” fee structures, meaning that they didn’t include revenue sharing or 12b-1 fees. ETF providers pushed 401(k) recordkeepers to make their systems compatible, to no avail, said Fred Barstein, founder of The Retirement Advisor University. “There was no demand. There was very little difference [plan fiduciaries] could tell at the time between an index fund and an ETF,” he said. A major issue comes from the 2006 Pension Protection Act, which allowed for automatic enrollment and helped buoy target-date funds as the default investment options in defined-contribution plans. Thanks to automatic enrollment (and the fact that workers interact little with their accounts), about 70% of the new money contributed to 401(k) accounts goes into target-date funds, Barstein noted. While ETFs are included in some target-date products, there’s otherwise “zero talk of ETFs in 401(k)s,” he said. And while some target-date fund providers use outside managers’ ETFs within their products, most of the big ones invest with in-house ETFs — meaning that opportunity in that avenue is limited. Of 156 target-date series that Sway Research tracks, 10 include allocations to ETFs and mutual funds, while seven hold ETFs exclusively, said Chris Brown, principal of that firm. Less than 3% of target-date CITs hold ETFs, while mutual fund series are much more likely to include ETFs, he said. All of the seven series that hold ETFs exclusively use asset managers’ own funds, and only a few of those that use a mix of mutual funds and ETFs use outside products. ETFs “really haven’t penetrated the target-date market much at all,” Brown said. “It’s kind of surprising.” Where they have found a niche, though, is in active-passive hybrid series, where managers add third-party index-based ETFs to diversify and lower costs, he noted. Some of the series that significantly use ETFs, per Sway: One ETF shop is trying something different. F/m Investments is among dozens of asset managers waiting for permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to add dual share classes, something the regulator is expected to grant this year. Most companies are seeking to add ETF share classes of existing mutual fund strategies, but F/m is doing the opposite, with the intention of landing spots for some of its products on defined-contribution plan menus. “Loads of DC buyers have said, ‘Why can’t we buy your products?’” F/m’s CEO Alex Morris said. But the company has refused to launch separate mutual fund versions of its ETFs because the performances of the two vehicles might diverge significantly due to the differences in trading, he said. The company is planning to start with mutual fund share classes of two of its ETFs and one ETF share class of an existing mutual fund. “Everyone is thinking it’s going to be this deluge, day one,” Morris said. “It’s actually kind of hard” to add a share class that’s a different investment vehicle, and “there’s a lot behind it that most issuers haven’t thought about.” At F/m, that has meant working with fund administration and accounting to keep track of capital gains, update baskets in real time and figure out what to put on the firm’s website, he said. Footing T-Bill. The first mutual fund shares the firm plans to roll out are for its F/m US Treasury 3-Month Bill ETF (TBIL) and Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF (RBIL). “ETFs have this super power,” Morris said. “In a mutual fund executing a T-Bill strategy, I need to put all the dealers I know in competition with each other … Here, every market maker is bidding on that ETF everyday,” he added. “You’re going to get a better price experience from that. You get to choose the price you pay.” Independent RIAs allocate as much as 80% — or as little as 2% — to ETFs, a new AdvizorPro report found. After several funds from the startup Yieldstreet resulted in total losses, experts questioned the role of private investments in client portfolios. With costs of living surging, some states fare better than others when it comes to retirement. The development illustrates Vanguard’s ongoing dominance in ETFs as well as client demand for low-cost, passive strategies. The tech analyst said his taste in fashion mirrors his team’s out-of-the-box stock picking philosophy. There have been reports of advisors leaving, as well as a race among competitors for the industry talent that went up for grabs. The investor protection organization wants its advertising rules to align more closely with federal standards. The industry is far from parity, but progress has been made over the past decade. Experts said the GENIUS Act, signed into law this month, will make advisors more confident about getting into digital currencies. Finalized last summer, the proposal intends to address issues like terrorist financing and foreign corruption in America’s advisory industry. Golfing and camping topped the list, according to a recent AdvizorPro survey. The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. New trends are shaking up the market, setting the stage for a shift in focus. Popular online tokens, new tech for digital infrastructure, and real-world asset platforms are now leading stories. Every project fights for attention as the next big thing. Find out which narratives are poised to grab the spotlight during this booming season. TAO powers Bittensor, a public network where many small brains work as one big brain. Each model shares its best ideas, learns from others, and earns TAO when its answers help the group. People outside the network can ask questions, guide tasks, and pay in the same coin. Because the code is open and the rules live on a blockchain, anyone, anywhere, can join, build, and own a piece of the growing mind. AI coins are hot this cycle, yet many just chase buzzwords. TAO stands apart because it already links real work to real pay. Bitcoin secures money, Ethereum runs apps, but TAO rewards thought. Its fixed supply and steady demand for learning may support price even in storms. Big firms now spend fortunes on data and chips; Bittensor taps global hobby rigs for the same goal and shares the gains. If the market continues to favor useful networks over hype, TAO could transition from a niche idea to a core holding. Hedera Hashgraph does not use a classic blockchain. It runs on a “hashgraph,” where computers share tiny pieces of data instead of bulky blocks. This design requires no mining, which saves energy and lowers fees. Each HBAR pays for actions on the network and helps guard it through Proof of Stake. The result is quick, cheap moves for payments, games, and even stock trades. Big names—like Google and IBM—sit on its council, adding trust and money to the project. Today’s market rewards coins that cut costs and waste. Bitcoin is strong but slow. Ethereum becomes busy and expensive during traffic spikes. New rivals such as Solana promise speed but battle outages. HBAR handles a high volume of deals per second effortlessly and keeps fees under a penny. Its code is patented, which may slow open-source fans, yet it also sets Hedera apart in a crowded field. With eco talk rising and firms seeking stable rails, HBAR looks well placed for the next upswing. XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first-ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of Web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional players. In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ondo Finance mixes the trust of old fintech with the speed of blockchain. It converts safe assets, such as US Treasury bills, into digital tokens that anyone can hold. Two teams drive this plan. One builds the products, the other codes the tech that lets them move with ease. Strong names back the project. BlackRock handles the bonds, and Coinbase keeps the crypto keys safe. Clear reports and strict rules add another layer of calm. The flagship token, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but also pays yield from the bonds behind it. In the current market, many coins chase hype yet swing wildly. ONDO offers a different story. Its value leans on real income from government bonds, not just code promises. As rates stay high, those bonds pay solid interest, and holders see that flow in tokens. Few other crypto projects can say the same. Rival stablecoins often sit idle, and pure DeFi coins still face hacks and heavy swings. TAO, HBAR, and ONDO look strong in the 2025 surge; however, pioneering all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) blends sports passion with meme culture, targets 20,000% upside, and invites early, community-led entry.

Title: Business Technology News: What’s In Microsoft Copilot’s GPT-5 Upgrade?

ByGene Marks, Contributor. Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? As of August 7, GPT-5 – OpenAI’s most advanced AI model – is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio worldwide. Microsoft posted the announcement detailing the following capabilities: -Copilot now uses GPT-5’s real-time router to select the best model for each prompt –either a fast-response engine for simple tasks or a deep-reasoning engine for complex ones. -Its human-like capability mirrors how people think producing incisive feedback when tasks require it. -Copilot can review a project, provide a summary of what worked and what didn’t, and draft a “lessons learned” document. -Copilot can handle large documents up to 100K tokens. Microsoft said this update is available for users who have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – availability to all users will roll out in the coming weeks. (Source: Microsoft) OpenAI has absorbed a fair amount of abuse for its rollout of GPT-5 in the past few weeks thanks to bugs and hallucinations. But the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, and like any new version of a software product, I’m confident the new platform will be more reliable in the coming months. Microsoft is already doubling down by incorporating into its Copilot offerings. If your company is using Copilot – be it for productivity or internal development – you’ll pretty much have no choice but to use the GPT-5 platform going forward. AI is reshaping the workforce often at the expense of employees according to CNBC’s report that compiled responses from management at companies like Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft. AI is being used to streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce labor costs. AI tools are replacing roles in customer service, HR, finance, and software development, especially entry-level and repetitive jobs. PayPal’s AI assistant – for example – is cutting down on customer service calls and live interactions. Rising unemployment numbers in the tech sector have been voiced by young workers whose skills overlap with AI capabilities. Executives often frame layoffs as “restructuring” or “optimization,” though experts say these are often euphemisms for AI-driven cuts. AI is quietly becoming a powerful force behind workforce reductions, even as companies tout its benefits for efficiency and innovation. (Source: CNBC) Ever see an employee typing pool? Telephone switchboard operators? Gas station attendants? Blacksmiths? Technology has always replaced people. This is nothing new. In 2025 big companies are doing this, mainly by employing AI in customer service and software development. Ultimately this technology will make its way into operations, sales, marketing, accounting and right down on to the shop floor. Small businesses will follow. Labor will be disrupted. The smartest employees will lean into this stuff and use it well. Others will find themselves out of a job. I’m sure there will be other opportunities, just like there’s always been. Angus Loten of the Wall Street Journal reported on the surge in CEO impersonation scams fueled by AI. Last year alone, over 105,000 deepfake attacks were reported with losses exceeding $200 million. Cybercriminals are using AI-generated deepfakes – hyper-realistic video and audio – to impersonate CEOs and other executives. These scams typically begin with a phone call or video meeting from a fake executive making urgent requests for money transfers, sensitive data, or access credentials. The deepfakes are shockingly convincing, mimicking real voices, facial expressions, and body language in real time. Scammers train AI models using publicly available content – interviews, webinars, earnings calls – to replicate executives’ speech and appearance. The targets of these sophisticated scams are often lower-level employees with privileged access. (Source: Wall Street Journal) Another day, another security threat…this time from AI. Deepfakes are getting better at fooling people and will continue to be a rising threat. But there are some old school ways to defend against this. For example, always call the person back. Require multiple sign-offs on any cash transaction. Require additional documentation, even if it’s from the boss. Get training and have some common sense. DocuSign is evolving far beyond e-signatures with its new AI-powered Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, unveiled in August 2025. With IAM, DocuSign now helps users manage the entire agreement lifecycle – from request intake to execution – using AI and automation. The AI can flag risky or non-compliant terms based on company playbooks; suggest edits to align with internal policies; and centralize templates and audit trails for consistency and visibility. DocuSign Iris is an AI engine that selects the best model for tasks like contract review, compliance checks, and identity verification. This shift turns contracts from static documents into dynamic, searchable data assets, helping businesses reduce errors, accelerate deal cycles, and improve compliance. (Source: Computer Weekly) As a user of DocuSign, I need to take the advice that I often give to others: lean into your software platforms and get training. We’re still using this platform like we did five years ago. And yet, here are a bunch of ways that we could be doing things better if we only spent the time to learn them. I’m in for some more training. PCWorld’s August 2025 guide offers a treasure trove of tech gear to supercharge your work-from-home setup – 42 products in total, all tested and recommended by their editorial team. Their top categories and standout picks: -Webcams: The Anker PowerConf C200 (2K resolution) helps you look sharp on Zoom without breaking the bank. -Laptop stands: Lamicall’s adjustable aluminum stand improves ergonomics and cooling, while Ugreen’s X-Fit doubles as a USB hub. -Audio gear: USB microphones and noise-canceling headphones are essential for clear communication and focus. -Lighting & ambiance: Ring lights, smart bulbs, and desk lamps enhance visibility and mood. -Furniture upgrades: Sit/stand desks and ergonomic chairs support posture and comfort during long hours.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: Nvidia Earnings, a Key Measure of Inflation, and More

After a sweeping rally for U.S. stocks Friday fueled by rising expectations of an interest rate cut next month, earnings from the world's most valuable company and a key measure of inflation could command the spotlight this week. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been front-and-center in the AI boom, with surging sales on growing demand for the emerging tech. Investors will likely be watching for updates on its most advanced offerings, as well as its plans to navigate changing trade policies, when the company posts its quarterly results. Investors can also look forward to the latest release of the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, which could influence whether the central bank makes its first interest rate cut of the year in September. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Nvidia’s second-quarter results due Wednesday could show whether the chipmaker continues to set the pace in the AI race, with analysts anticipating another sales record despite some headwinds from China export curbs. Nvidia said in May that it expects to report growing revenue, though it warned of a hit from China export restrictions to the tune of $8 billion. The company could offer more updates on its business in China after making a deal with the Trump administration to share revenue from its AI chip sales there. Nvidia is also considering offering a variety of new products for the Chinese market in advance of government approval. Some other companies set to report this week include chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell (DELL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), cloud provider Snowflake (SNOW), and engineering software maker Autodesk (ADSK), along with several Canadian banks. A fresh update on inflation is set to come Friday, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index for July, after dovish remarks last week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted expectations for a rate cut in September. The June PCE report showed that inflation ticked higher that month, but a similar inflation report released earlier showed price increases in July were lower than some feared. The PCE report is the Fed’s preferred measurement of inflation, giving its reading potentially more impact with central bankers ahead of September's interest rate decision. This week will also bring a pair of consumer surveys, data on the U.S. trade balance, and housing market data, among other things. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Read Investopedia’s Latest News Monday, Aug. 25 Tuesday, Aug. 26 Wednesday, Aug. 27 Thursday, Aug. 28 Friday, Aug. 29 A new partnership between CME Group and FanDuel will soon allow for “event contracts” on a wide variety of events, letting users make bets on the outcome of the latest inflation report, cryptocurrency movements, where the S&P 500 finishes, and a host of financial marketplace results.

Title: What I learned about productivity this year
URL: https://www.platformer.news/productivity-tools-ai-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
What I gave up, what I kept, and what's new. PLUS: How I'm using AI Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year. Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why. Let's get into it. In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself. I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year. With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year. Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion. Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here. Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community. I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast. I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway? Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself. It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free. Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it. I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward. Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him. Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself. That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things: For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!) And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write! Two years ago, I wrote this: This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved. I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database. This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became. One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf. Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper. Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date. If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same. But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it. On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children. And finally, I introduce Kevin to the wild world of "shock slop" — AI-generated songs meant to freak out your parents.

Title: Cracker Barrel’s marketing fiasco shows investors are making woke a massive risk factor

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 7:00:15 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican If the Cracker Barrel market puke has anything to teach Wall Street, it’s that investors who are deciding where to put their money must add corporate “wokeness” to their menu of risks to ­digest. In fact, making “woke” an investing risk factor — in some cases as important as the direction of interest rates and inflation — seems so obvious that I hesitated to write this column. Recall Bud Light’s ­Dylan Mulvaney fiasco, or Target CEO Brian Cornell’s recent exit following his ill-fated ­obsession with DEI. Wokeness is generally defined as subjecting the culture and business to left-wing dogma involving race, sex and viewing all things Americana as anathema. It simply doesn’t sell to mass audiences. And yet companies keep going there. Corporate managers, it turns out, are a politically and socially tone-deaf bunch. They are lousy at reading the current mood of the country and its hatred of progressive indoctrination — whether in the classroom or when they simply want to enjoy a beer. Their advisers may be even worse. That’s why shareholders must demand — whether it’s at annual meetings, on earnings calls or with testy phone calls to Investor Relations — that the C-suite extricate wokeness from corporate decision-making. While it’s not mainstream, there are some savvy Wall Street types adding “woke risk” to their models, just not using that exact terminology. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

I’m convinced that was the conscious plan with Disney.

Title: The High Cost Of Ditching DEI: What Target’s Boycott Fallout Reveals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T01:43:00Z
Full Content:
ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. It was recently announced that Target’s CEO of 11 years, Brian Cornell, would be stepping down and Michael Fiddelke, 20-year Target veteran and the Chief Operating Officer, would be stepping in to replace him. Target’s stock has seen a considerable decline since the start of 2025. While some have attributed the company’s decline to Trump’s tariffs and the weakening economy, the company’s about-face when it came to DEI sparked backlash and criticism, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers. In February of 2025, prominent Atlanta pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of Target in response to the company’s rollback of their DEI initiatives. The boycott, Bryant indicated, has been the most successful Black boycott since the Montgomery Bus Boycott that occurred 70 years ago. DEI is currently the nation’s favorite bogeyman; being blamed for everything from bridge collapses to plane crashes. There is still a lack of understanding regarding what DEI is, how it can positively impact employees and how it can benefit workplaces, contributing to some of the DEI pushback that has increased in recent months. Make no mistake; DEI is far from perfect, but the existence of workplace DEI programs often provides a pathway to address harm that takes place in the workplace. Many Black consumers saw Target’s decision to cut DEI initiatives as a slap in the face. The company was seemingly so outspoken with their support of Black businesses, pledging a $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses after the murder of George Floyd. Consumers have become much more judicious with their spending, deciding to resist through their wallets. Costco has been an outspoken advocate of DEI, choosing not to flounder under pressure from DEI opponents, and has seen a net increase in sales, which many attribute to their doubling down of DEI. Target drew the public’s ire because unlike many of the companies that announced they were scaling back their DEI efforts in the past year, Target was one of the most ardent supporters of DEI through their racial equity agenda. With Target being headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was at ground zero following the tragic murder of George Floyd. The expectation was that their proximity to the tragedy would result in a true commitment to uplift the Black community, but less than five years later, the company reneged on their promises and pledges. In 1969, activist Fred Hampton was instrumental in spearheading the Rainbow Coalition, where different groups of people worked together to address a common issue. What made the coalition so successful is the power in numbers—multiple people working towards a shared goal is an effective way to combat societal ills. During the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Black folks were able to inspire and mobilize people from outside the Black community to join their cause. What has made the Target boycott so successful has been a similar strategy from the boycott organizers. It hasn’t been only Black consumers who have been boycotting Target. Communities of other historically marginalized and excluded populations (Latinos, poor folks, the LGBTQIA+ community) have also mobilized to support the boycott. Different groups who knew that DEI rollbacks would impact their communities have come together after calls to boycott from leaders like Bryant. There is power in numbers but it’s important to note: when there is a critical mass of people working towards a shared goal, that goal can be accomplished, according to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth’s research indicated that only 3.5% of a population’s participation is needed to drive change. The question remains whether the hiring of a new CEO will resurrect Target’s image and thus their sales. In a recent CNN interview, Bryant noted that hiring an internal candidate who has been at the company for decades will not change the company’s engrained ideology or their stance on DEI. Contrary to the popular saying, companies that “go woke,” perhaps won’t actually go broke. Companies should learn from Target’s missteps; a commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and fairly is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have. Both consumers and employees are watching; if your words don’t align with your actions, there will be a price to pay. Rather than swaying to appease investors, the DEI detractors, or this current administration, the longevity and sustainability of companies will ultimately be decided by how they treat their employees. People are not settling for crumbs—a failure to prioritize the wellbeing of workers will continue to have dire consequences.

Title: Judge Allows Claim That Large Investors Conspired To Drive Up Coal, Energy Costs

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 4:20:09 PM PDT by CFW Wyoming and 10 other states’ claims that giant investment companies conspired to drive coal production down and drive prices up — increasing people’s energy costs — are at least plausible enough to keep a lawsuit alive, a judge has ruled. Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led the litigation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the complaint. The states allege the three massive investment companies acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the U.S., then agreed to use their holdings to influence those companies and artificially depress the output of coal. “Defendants allegedly did so in the name of ‘environmental stewardship’ and ‘concern for the climate,’” recounted U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle in an Aug. 1 order. “The result, Plaintiffs assert, is that ‘Defendants have reaped the rewards of higher returns, higher fees, and higher profits, while American consumers have paid the price in higher utility bills and higher costs.’” (Excerpt) Read more at cowboystatedaily.com ...

Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc.

Title: BlackRock ETH $254M move and the Pepeto versus Little Pepe choice for the best crypto token
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-eth-254m-move-and-the-pepeto-versus-little-pepe-choice-for-the-best-crypto-token/

Full Content:
Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum lead the next wave, or make room for new names? Bitcoin is quiet as large holders buy and keep, so it acts like a safe asset today. On August 21, 2025, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETFs recorded $254M exit, yet many experts still see strength in ETH. Arthur Hayes says ETH could reach $10K to $20K, and charts point to a level near $5,500. Even so, many traders now see only about two times left in BTC and ETH, so focus shifts to presale memecoins with tiny prices and larger upside. Is that where the big money will go next? One new token stays on the Ethereum mainnet and aims to solve real problems. It has already raised millions and includes live tools, a zero-fee DEX, a cross-chain bridge, and staking at a rate of nearly 240 percent. Another new meme coin takes the Layer 2 route that many teams choose. It offers speed, but it adds steps and bridge risk that can drain trust and flow. Whales who once backed Pepe and Shiba now choose between these two as the best memecoin. So, what do they offer, and which one is the smarter choice in 2025? Pepeto, PEPETO, is an Ethereum memecoin in presale at $0.000000148, with over $6M raised and more than 100,000 community members. A demo exchange is live, and audits by SolidProof and Coinsult are complete. Built on the Ethereum mainnet, it blends meme culture with working tools, a zero-fee DEX, a native cross-chain bridge, and staking at a near 240% APY. This mix of trust and utility makes Pepeto one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Little Pepe, in contrast, sits on a Layer 2 network, which adds friction, thinner liquidity, and higher bridge risk. Its presale spreads many tokens, but without strong audits or live tools, it remains basic, and its Layer 2 base looks weak next to Pepeto’s mainnet build. Pepeto, PEPETO, is built on the Ethereum mainnet, a tougher route but the one with better upside. It tackles two major issues: high fees and thin liquidity. PepetoSwap offers zero-fee trading, allowing users to keep more of their funds, and every swap utilizes Pepeto tokens. That creates steady demand, similar to how BNB supports Binance’s long-term growth. The Pepeto Bridge moves tokens across chains inside one app. For early buyers, this mix can turn first entries into millionaire results as use expands toward one hundred times or more. Little Pepe uses a Layer 2. It is not much faster, and it adds steps, more bridge risk, and less trust. Beyond a presale, it brings little, and it looks weak next to Pepeto’s tools and mainnet build; it cannot deliver beyond five times. Pepeto is set for life-changing gains. After launch, achieving fifty times is feasible, and with a Tier 1 listing like Binance, one hundred times becomes realistic. As more tokens join PepetoSwap, demand can climb again, making $200,000 a clear target. Also, thirty percent of the supply is allocated for staking, offering rewards of nearly 244 percent APY, which supports the price as more buyers arrive. Little Pepe may jump five times after launch from presale buzz, but coins like this often fall quickly. Without tools, mainnet strength, or deep liquidity, its Layer 2 base can see price drops in days. That is where Pepeto stands apart; staking and real products keep it alive, while weak, hype-only coins like Little Pepe fade. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be steady now, but many analysts say the most they can deliver from here is about two times, and even that could be hard. Side by side, Pepeto versus Little Pepe makes the choice clear. Pepeto operates on the Ethereum mainnet, utilizing real tools, a demo exchange, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native bridge, and robust staking. In contrast, Little Pepe relies on a thin Layer 2 with minimal real value. This is why smart whales are moving into Pepeto. They were early to Shiba and Pepe before the big runs, and they know when a true opportunity appears. For them, Pepeto is the name that can change the life of every early buyer, so the time to step in is now.

Under President Trump, the U.S. government is increasingly intervening in corporate America, taking equity stakes in companies like U.S. Steel, MP Materials, and Intel. This shift, driven by national security concerns, resembles state-managed capitalism, worrying Wall Street. Companies are scrambling to adapt, fearing demands and potential disadvantages if they don't align with the administration.

Title: 'The dumbest thing I've ever heard': Amazon Web Services CEO lambasts replacing junior employees with AI, but he still loves AI

AWS CEO Matt Garman spoke up for entry-level jobs, but still insists AI will change all jobs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In an interview with investor and AI evangelist Matthew Berman this week, AWS CEO Matt Garman shut down the idea that junior employees should be replaced by AI, calling it "the dumbest thing I've ever heard." "They're probably the least expensive employees you have, they're the most leaned in to your AI tools, and how's that going to work when you go, like, 10 years in the future and you have no one that has built up or learned anything? "My view is like, you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it." But overall, Garman still has the optimistic take on AI's impact on the job market you commonly see from tech executives. "I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job," Garman said. "But it doesn't mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them." He added that, "I'm not minimizing that uncertainty that people will have and I know people are worried about [AI] and I think one of the things is, embrace that technology. The more you can embrace that technology, be flexible, understand how it can help you do your job faster and better, [then] I think the better off people are going to be as they make that transition." It's somewhat refreshing to hear a tech CEO defend entry-level jobs, especially with some estimates showing some 50% of all entry-level office jobs could be eliminated by AI in the coming years. Unfortunately, these comments come just a month after hundreds of Amazon Web Services employees were laid off. Amazon explained the layoffs in a statement to Reuters, commenting: "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." While that statement doesn't mention AI, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made comments back in June that seemed to hint that AI will be responsible for job elimination. Jassy said in an employee memo, "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company."

Title: 6 Things To Know About The Meta/Google Cloud AI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/08/23/6-things-to-know-about-the-metagoogle-cloud-ai-deal/

ByJohn Werner, Contributor. Meta’s new deal with Google for AI cloud hosting comes with a big price tag — the deal is reportedly worth $10 billion. That’s the equivalent of 666 million large pizzas — or two for each person in the U.S. It’s also equal to the GDP of a small country. So what’s behind this monolithic business agreement? Here are some interesting aspects of this newly announced tech partnership. The $10 billion deal with Google is part of a Meta plan to invest a total of over $100 billion in AI. Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about this kind of scaling up, as the company lays off significant numbers of human workers, moves the survivors to departments that are heavier on AI and automates business processes like it’s going out of style. The proclaimed “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 saw a lot of this action, and Meta doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The deal also lasts until 2031, by which time we might have superhuman agents, godlike AGI and brand-new national economies built on crypto or some more out-there foundation. So you could be forgiven for imagining that, for all practical purposes, Google and Meta are essentially going to the altar and not just making a short-term deal when it comes to tech allegiances. Another thing to know about this deal is that it is, to some extent, a stopgap solution and part of the greater debate for large companies like Meta about “build vs. buy” — that is, whether it is better to use an outside vendor’s resources or build them internally. That extends to models as well as data centers: as LLMs became more ubiquitous, companies had to decide whether to run their AI applications on someone else’s model (cough cough, OpenAI) or build one themselves. And to be clear, OpenAI does have competitors, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t have that many. In terms of data center planning, Meta already has fairly concrete plans for Prometheus and Hyperion, which are projected to provide 1 gigawatt and 5 gigawatts, respectively, over time. So after that six years, we could see a very different landscape emerging. In offering services in the cloud AI market, Google goes up against a formidable competitor. AWS has been the household brand for cloud practically since the beginning, and by now, the firm has launched AWS Bedrock, where users can actually choose among top models from OpenAI, DeepSeek or others, including Anthropic (AWS was an early backer of Claude). But the new agreement gives Google a boost in AI cloud and reportedly led to a 32% increase in revenue for the company since the deal was announced. Another part of the context is how customers, particularly smaller ones, feel about Google’s cloud services, including the new AI provisioning. Presumably, Meta would not be worried about a rug pull in terms of deprecation, but notes in places like Reddit show that others ponder whether Google Cloud is “going to last” in the competitive environment and, alternately, whether Google will choose to deprecate services. Google’s documentation reveals that Google services are subject to deprecation, so that’s something to keep in mind, but doesn’t necessarily mean that something like that is in the cards or that the company will be “churning” services and rocking smaller customers out of the boat. Regardless of its deal with Meta, Google isn’t just in the business of offering bulk. Its GCP also offers feature services like BigQuery, a serverless data warehouse, and TensorFlow, an open-source ML framework enabling multi-dimensional arrays. There’s a Kubernetes engine, object storage and more, helping the company to rival AWS’ ecosystem approach. Here are some more of Google’s AI offerings: Vertex AI: Google Cloud’s unified platform for building, training, deploying and managing machine learning models with integrated MLOps tools. Generative AI Studio: Vertex AI tool for creating, fine-tuning and deploying generative AI models using prompts and customization. Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech: prebuilt AI APIs. Vision AI: cloud-based service that analyzes images and videos, detecting objects, text, faces and visual patterns using machine learning. All of this is going to help the company to remain a powerhouse in AI cloud along with AWS and Microsoft. The deal is notable partly because of its size and partly because it involves not one but two of the companies included in the former acronym FAANG, which represented the five top tech companies in America. That list has shifted a bit, notably, with the emergence of Nvidia as king of the stock market, but Meta and Google are still two titans. Stay tuned for more.

Title: Can AI ‘sorcery’ solve the ‘productivity paradox’ that has gripped the economy for 25 years? A Shakespearean sea change is underfoot
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/23/worker-productivity-ai-bofa-automation-inflation-do-more-with-less-sea-change/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T10:04:00Z

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. The late plays by William Shakespeare are alternately called his “romances” or his “problem plays,” because of their ambiguity in tone, as they alternate from passages of magical realism to stark scenes that grapple with complex social issues. At times, they point the way toward the prestige TV of the early 21st century where, for instance, The Sopranos could range from broad comedy to intense violence to avant-garde dream sequences, all in one episode. It’s from the romances that we get phrases that stick with us today, like the description from The Tempest of a “sea change into something rich and strange.” Full disclosure: The author’s brother is an eminent Shakespearean scholar, often quoted in The New York Times, although never previously in Fortune, and so I asked him to explain what this particular term means. “Toward the end of his career,” Drew Lichtenberg of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC, said in a statement to Fortune, “Shakespeare started writing genre-defying plays with sudden and miraculous changes of fortune.” Shakespeare used the phrase “sea change” to describe a “magical storm at sea that has the power to snuff out life or restore it in less than a second.” What do Shakespeare’s plays of miraculous changes of fortune have to do with, well, Fortune? Bank of America Institute has projected a “sea change” in the economy. It sees a pivotal transformation in worker productivity at America’s largest companies, driven by lessons from post-pandemic inflation and supercharged by a wave of artificial intelligence and automation. The institute worked hand in hand with projections from Bank of America Research to project a rewiring of the fundamental valuation landscape of the S&P 500, with profound implications for investors and the “quality premium” that U.S. stocks traditionally command. Fortune talked to BofA Research’s Head of US Equity & Quantitative Strategy, Savita Subramanian, to dig into this change, potentially to something rich and strange. It’s not quite that mystical, she said, but she still thinks it’s a big deal. Subramanian explained that what her team has projected isn’t as exciting or dramatic as having actual wizards working at the gears of the economy. The more prosaic insight, she says, is that the combination of AI technology and lessons learned from the inflation wave of the 2020s mean that worker productivity is finally showing signs of increasing. That’s the sea change taking place. At its heart, her work is all about the famous “productivity paradox” identified by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow. “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,” he said in 1987, long before the productivity crisis of the 21st century set in. As Fortune‘s Jeremy Kahn has discussed, workers still don’t seem to be getting more productive despite the bevy of new technologies at their disposal. In fact, McKinsey’s Chris White and Olivia White argued in 2024 that productivity has been dismal for nearly a generation, hovering around 1% a year, with a dip after the Great Financial Crisis. Subramanian agrees, telling Fortune that if you look at productivity measures, “they haven’t really improved all that much since 2001.” Subramanian wrote on Aug. 8 that the end goal of the massive AI spending that’s rippling through the economy is a “sea-change” in the scale and scope of efficiency gains—and this productivity cycle is already under way. Post-pandemic wage inflation forced companies “to do more with fewer people,” she added, and now AI tools are due to kick that up a notch. But the official stats don’t show a complete understanding of how productivity really functions, Subramanian explained. So BofA took sales, adjusted for inflation, and then divided sales by the number of people working at S&P 500 companies, showing real sales growth versus number of people, what she called a “decent proxy” for productivity, “because if you’re productive, you are doing things more efficiently, you need less labor. And this is more labor efficiency than anything else.” Look at what she found. This means companies are learning to do more with less, and that is kind of magical. Companies have had to do harder work to generate earnings and keep margins healthy, often by replacing their people with processes. “A process is almost free and it’s replicable for eternity,” she said, adding that she thinks this is why the companies exercising efficiency gains have tended to outperform. It’s not only about AI displacing workers, but a fundamental shift in how business is being done. This discussion may seem on its face to be more boring than a tempest and a wizard, she said, but there is something supernatural about the current moment. “I think people love this AI technology because it feels like sorcery,” she said, before adding, “the truth is it hasn’t really changed the world that much yet, but I don’t think it’s something to be dismissed.” Overall, Subramanian finds the S&P 500 has shifted from its 1980s model of asset- and labor-intensive manufacturing to asset- and labor-light innovation, namely tech and health care firms. Showing her work, she calculates that the S&P 500 firms with a focus on innovation, measured through high research and development expenditures, trade at structurally higher multiples of 29x forward earnings per share. More capital-intensive manufacturers, on the other hand, trade at a 21x multiple. The current AI boom is actually a bit risky, she wrote, because the massive data center investments represent a shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavier focus. To be sure, BofA finds that the S&P 500 is now statistically expensive on 19 out of the 20 metrics that they track, including P/E, price to book, price to cash flow, and market cap/GDP. That’s where the sea change matters, because if the shift from manufacturing to innovation is real, then valuations have to shift as well. Hence the “innovation premium” from BofA’s research. Excluding Tesla, Subramanian talks about the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” as evidence of firms losing some of their innovation premium as a result of a shift toward asset-heaviness. As a basket of stocks, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Apple’s average shareholder yield (i.e., dividends plus net buybacks) has dropped by over 1% since 2015. There are other shifts afoot as well, she told Fortune. “We seem to be at least pausing on this globalization theme,” she said, citing China’s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a big driver of margin expansion, enabling cost-cutting as a huge lever to keep margins expanding. (It was also the year when worker productivity froze in its tracks.) In the globalization regime, “you didn’t have to think too hard to make money and expand your margins,” she said. It was “very easy and fungible and frictionless” for companies to buy things from different places and contain costs. She also cited the low-interest-rate environment that persisted for much of the past few decades, enabling lots of “financial engineering.” For example, Subramanian said it was common to see companies that knew they would miss their earnings estimates borrowing money and buying back stock to hit their targets, adding the caveat that “there are good reasons to do share buybacks and bad reasons to do share buybacks.” This all “really created a lot of bizarre behavior.” Warren Buffett’s long-time fondness for stock buybacks has even come under fire from other investors, with Jeremy Grantham writing in 2023 that it facilitates stock manipulation and should be illegal. BofA Research found in July 2025, however, that stock buybacks had decelerated a bit, albeit they remained high by historical standards. The situation now is harder in many ways, but companies aren’t able to financially engineer their way to earnings growth, she added. Now that’s a sea change. One final note on the Shakespearean romances, from Drew Lichtenberg: that appellation came about in the late 1700s, nearly two centuries after Shakespeare’s lifetime, with the birth of the romantic movement. The word “romantic” had previously existed, but it didn’t have its current meaning until Samuel Taylor Coleridge elevated it to mean something that connects back directly to nature and the divine genius of humanity’s self-expression. This was largely a response to the Enlightenment’s elevation of reason and logic and its ultimate achievement: the Industrial Revolution that unleashed modern capitalism on the world.

Title: A Microsoft veteran says declining morale and a 'culture shift' drove him to resign: 'The great flattening was definitely happening'

Full Content:
Phil Coachman loved working at Microsoft for most of his nearly decadelong tenure. But as the culture began to shift and layoffs piled up, he decided it was time to move on. He started looking for a new role in July 2024 when he was still at Microsoft, but struggled to get much traction. In January, he resigned from his role as a senior cloud solution architect to focus on his job search. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said the 44-year-old, who lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." Coachman said company layoffs — including the elimination of about 10,000 roles in 2023 — took a toll on his morale and that of his co-workers. He said he knew several people who were let go, including one teammate he regarded as a "top performer." "Every team that I worked with was just down," he said. "So now you go to work and everybody's depressed every day." Coachman is among the current and former Microsoft employees who have been affected by workforce reductions — either by losing a job or being left to adjust to coworker departures. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Coachman to switch jobs — or find new ones after they resign or are laid off. "It just got to a point where morale was no longer up to par," Coachman said, "and ultimately it got to a place where it was time to make a change." Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: After working as a Microsoft contractor for several years, Coachman joined the company full-time in 2015. He said he's extremely grateful for his time at the company, and that before joining, he was earning far less and just trying to get by. He'd be open to returning in the future, he said, if he saw signs of a positive culture shift. During his final years at Microsoft, Coachman said there appeared to be a push to reduce the number of managers in an effort to increase what the company calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager. While his own manager's number of direct reports didn't change during his time on the team, he said they are now working in an individual contributor role. He also said he saw the number of reports per manager increase on other teams. "I saw managers leave and other managers absorb that head count, so you go from managing 10 people to now maybe 18 people, which when you talk to those managers, becomes really hard," he said. "The great flattening was definitely happening." Beyond layoffs and shifts in management structure, Coachman said he also began being asked to focus more on performance metrics, which he felt came at the cost of flexibility and meaningful customer work. In recent years, Big Tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have revamped their performance review and compensation structures to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Another key factor in his decision to resign was the uptick in business travel. He said he was on the road about three times a month — a return to pre-pandemic norms. "It just got to a point where I was missing too much of my kids' lives," he said, adding that his work frustrations made travel less tolerable. "It was different when I was traveling and the job was awesome." When Coachman started his job search in July 2024, he thought it was going to be fairly easy. There seemed to be plenty of job postings on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, so after pinpointing a few roles he felt qualified for, he figured he'd be able to get interviews and eventually land an offer. But he quickly realized it wouldn't be that simple. After all, US businesses were hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. "It was six months of basically just being ghosted," he said. "It was a completely different world than when I had applied to a job decades ago." Coachman said he went through several rounds of résumé tweaks — thinking the format might be the issue — but still got little response. As his job search dragged on, Coachman said he was hesitant to resign from his Microsoft job before having another role lined up because it would mean giving up a steady paycheck and unvested company stock. However, he said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel more comfortable. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." In early 2024, Coachman said he hired a life coach — in part to help him navigate the changes he was experiencing at work. He said the life coach helped him get confident in his decision to resign, adding that hiring them was maybe the "best investment" he'd ever made. After resigning, Coachman said he adjusted his job search strategy. Rather than simply applying for jobs, he spent more time tapping into the network he'd built over the years. He targeted roles at companies where he knew someone, then reached out to ask whether they thought he'd be a good fit — and if they'd be willing to refer him. In one instance, he saw a few open roles at the data analytics and AI startup Databricks, where a former Microsoft colleague of his worked. After reaching out, Coachman said they recommended he focus on one specific role that they'd be willing to refer him for. The next day, Coachman received a call from a company recruiter. After the interview process, he received an offer and started working for the company in April. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said. Coachman said his pay is comparable to what he earned at Microsoft, and that the signing bonus helped make up for what he left behind in unvested stock. He said his travel is also now limited to no more than once a month, which was a big factor in his decision to accept the offer. Over the course of his roughly nine-month job search, Coachman said he applied to hundreds of jobs and received two offers — one for his current role and another from a startup he turned down due to concerns about job security. His top advice for job seekers: build your network and lean on it. Rather than just connecting on LinkedIn, he said, it's better to have real conversations that help foster relationships. He said this could boost your chances of landing a referral down the road — giving your application the "personal touch" it might need to get past applicant tracking system scanners. "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference," he said. Jump to

August 22, 2025 18:59 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Europe's Economy Is Stagnating as the U.S. Grows Richer. It Doesn't Have To Be This Way.

Time Published: 2025-08-22T22:01:07Z

Economics Sam Bowman | From the October 2025 issue It's not hard to see why Europeans often feel a sense of superiority over Americans. No European city has an area as dangerous or decrepit as San Francisco's Tenderloin district. Some Americans obsess about Europe's supposedly no-go areas, but no European city has crime on par with places like Memphis, Tennessee, or St. Louis, Missouri. In 2023, more people were murdered in Chicago (population: 2.7 million) than in all of Italy (population: 59 million). When you ride New York's subways, it's best not to wear nice shoes in case you step in a pool of vomit. Our cities are not just vastly safer than America's: They're more beautiful, more vibrant with history and art and food. Europe has the Tuscan countryside, the Swiss Alps, Barcelona, Provence, the French Riviera, and the Balearic Islands, all inside an area smaller than Texas. Europe may be beautiful, but it has become a byword for economic malaise—a land of snooty Europoors who prostrate themselves before a disdainful President Donald Trump because they aren't sure they can defend themselves from Russian aggression. Most of us in Europe don't own ice makers. It can get very hot during our summers, but air conditioning is still a luxury across the continent. An American friend visiting my house in London was bewildered to see me hanging my clothes up to dry on a metal hanger in my hallway: Like most Europeans, I don't own a dryer. The average American could stop working in the first week of October and still will have earned more than the average Frenchman working until the end of the year. In Western Europe, GDP per capita—the average economic output per person—is about $63,000 per year, adjusted for the cost of living. In the United States, it is $86,000. Yes, Europeans work fewer hours and take more vacation. But that explains only part of the gap. For roughly two decades, Western Europe, home to the continent's largest economies, has stagnated. In 1995, its labor productivity—the value of goods and services produced per hour worked—was 95 percent of what it was in the United States, having risen from just 22 percent in 1945. By 2023, it was down to 80 percent. Ten years ago, 52 of the world's top 100 companies by market capitalization were American and 28 were European. Since then, the American total has grown to 58 while the European count has fallen to 18. The United States has produced five companies worth more than $2 trillion. At around $350 billion, Europe's largest company, the enterprise software provider SAP, is worth about as much as Home Depot. Many Europeans assume their lower incomes are the price they pay for ensuring their poorer countrymen have better living standards. But the median American household has a disposable income that is 16 percent higher than the median German household, adjusted for purchasing power. Only the poorest 10 percent of Americans do worse than their French, German, or Italian counterparts in terms of disposable income, which factors in taxes and welfare. What explains this gap between Europe and the U.S.? There are many factors, from rigid labor markets to energy restrictions to trade barriers to burdensome regulations on tech companies. The connecting thread is that Europe is poor because of specific policy choices. Europe is poor because it chose to be poor. Europe's most obvious failure is its tech sector. By nearly every measure it lags behind America's, in an era in which technological progress is one of the strongest drivers of material well-being. Yet rather than try to emulate America's relatively hands-off approach, which has given its entrepreneurs, inventors, and investors the freedom to build such companies as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and Google, the European Union (E.U.) is known as a "regulatory superpower." In recent years, the E.U. has imposed expansive new regulations on data privacy, which enshrined in law the cookie banners that now litter the internet, and has plunged into the preemptive regulation of artificial intelligence, which its internal market commissioner claimed would allow European "startups and researchers to lead the global race for trustworthy AI." Europe has some of the highest electricity prices on Earth, thanks to environmental laws and an overreliance on imported gas—a huge problem when AI relies on power-hungry data centers. But never fear: Electronic devices in the E.U. must be fitted with a USB-C port, eliminating a grand total of 2 grams of waste per citizen per year. E.U. leaders insist this is actually America's fault. European officialdom spent much of the 2010s blaming its tech sector's sluggishness on unfair practices by American tech companies. One official even compared U.S. tech companies to a soccer team that trapped its opponents in their dressing room: "Someone has locked it and thrown away the key." Their answer, inevitably, was even more regulation. In 2022, the E.U. passed blockbuster legislation to regulate platforms like Google and Amazon. This, it said, would "create new opportunities for startups." It didn't work. Two months later, OpenAI, an American startup with no previous consumer products, launched ChatGPT. A few months after that, Anthropic and Google followed with their offerings. (Google's DeepMind is based in London, but Google bought it in 2014.) Here was a digital market where success could not reasonably be attributed to incumbency, yet European companies were still on the fringes. Europe has missed out on wave after wave of frontier technology not because of American mischief, but because the continent has allowed its labor markets, energy costs, trade policy, and capital markets to go awry. Belgium, home to the E.U.'s capital city of Brussels, is famous for having survived without a formal, permanent federal government. It went 652 days with an interim government until a new federal government was formed in 2020. A decade earlier, in 2010, it went 589 days before a government was finally formed. A caretaker administration sat in power during these periods, keeping the machinery of the state operating but unable to pass any new laws, spending, or tax reforms. Yet life went on. Belgians who got sick were still covered by the country's universal health insurance system. Belgians turning 65 still retired into a generous pension, pegged to whatever they had earned during their working lives. The trains kept running, and crime stayed low. Though the country was rocked by bank failures in 2008–2009 and the wider eurozone debt crisis that followed the Great Recession, life has not become radically different for ordinary people over these years. Taxes and government spending are slowly rising, and GDP growth was an anemic 0.6 percent per year from 2007 through 2023 (half of the rate in the U.S.). As in many European countries, issues like immigration and Islam got more attention than the country's underlying economic and political sclerosis. It may be tempting to conclude that Europeans are simply less culturally inclined toward economic dynamism and growth. Maybe a quiet life is all that Europeans really want. But this argument is unconvincing. There are, after all, plenty of European tech founders. They just live in America. One in 10 U.S. tech startups is founded by a European, and that share has risen over the past 10 years. It is also hard to square this argument with Europe's history. Brussels is less than half an hour from the cradle of modern capitalism. The old towns of Ghent and Bruges are nearly perfectly preserved from their late medieval heyday, when they were at the crossroads of Europe's wool and cloth trade. The world's first stock exchange still stands in Bruges. Nearby Antwerp was the capital of global trade and finance in the 16th century, when modern capitalism really started to flower. In the 19th century, Belgium industrialized earlier and faster than the United States, building powerful coal, iron, textile and railway industries, and leading the way out of poverty and hunger. Europe, historically, has had no shortage of entrepreneurs and capitalists. So why do companies struggle to innovate in Europe today? Pieter Garicano, author of the Silicon Continent newsletter, has suggested that what really separates European companies from American ones is Europe's high cost of business failure, rooted in its inflexible labor laws. Each country's rules are different. But they tend to protect workers from being fired, require union agreement for mass layoffs, and demand large payouts for those who do lose their jobs. These are more than just the cost of doing business. In markets where companies have to take risks, mass layoffs can be unavoidable. But in the United States, layoffs are usually quick and relatively low-cost; in the E.U., they can take months or even years. Turnover is thus much higher in America. About 1 percent of the U.S. work force is laid off every month, whereas in Germany, less than 0.1 percent is. That makes the cost of risk-taking much higher in Europe than in the United States. American companies can treat layoffs as a normal if regrettable part of the trial-and-error process. For European companies, the difficulty of shutting down company divisions when strategic bets turn out not to have paid off makes it much more costly to take those bets to begin with. For larger companies, this can make it far harder to change approach than their rivals elsewhere find it. Volkswagen, Europe's largest company by revenue, faces an enormous threat from inexpensive Chinese electric vehicles, yet its attempts to restructure were drawn out for more than a year by union objections to factory closures, which the company eventually gave in to. When SAP laid off 10,000 workers, it reportedly had to pay out three years' worth of salary to each of the European employees it wanted to let go. Smaller companies are often exempted from these rules. But that makes little difference, because every ambitious little startup hopes to one day become a big one, and plans accordingly. The prospect of being captured by these labor laws once they have grown puts them off from setting up in Europe. It also deters venture capital investors. Not every European state has such restrictive labor laws. Denmark, for example, pairs generous unemployment insurance with flexible rules about hiring and firing, a model known as "flexicurity." Sweden's are also much less rigid than those in most of Western Europe. These countries are among the richest in Europe. Denmark is one of the few European nations that approaches America's GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, and it has one of the continent's highest levels of employment. These countries also punch well above their weight in high tech. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, which has pioneered the use of GLP-1 drugs to help with weight loss, has become one of Europe's biggest companies. Sweden's Spotify is one of Europe's only successful consumer technology platforms. Rigid labor market laws have another drawback. The more difficult it is to hire and fire workers, the harder immigrants tend to find it to assimilate into their new country's job market—and the more they resort to low-paid informal work that they can get through social and family connections. This reduces how much exposure they get to people from their new country's native population, which makes them less likely to adjust to, and adopt, the country's values. When combined with generous welfare benefits, that also makes it easier to keep women at home instead of working, which further limits cultural integration. More flexible labor market laws might not just add vitality to Europe's economies; they could help address one of the continent's biggest social problems. In 2003, energy prices in America and in Europe's largest economies were similar. But by 2021—before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent European energy prices even higher—German industrial electricity prices were 156 percent of what American industrial users were paying. Spanish industrial customers were paying twice the American price. In 2021, Italian businesses, who have long faced high prices, paid four times as much for electricity as American ones. In Europe's largest economies, energy prices were nearly twice as high as American prices before the Ukraine war. The price of natural gas has shot up since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driving energy costs even higher. One in 10 Europeans reported not being able to keep their homes warm enough during the winter of 2023. In 2022, when energy prices were at their highest, factories across the continent were forced to furlough their workers and pause production. But it is a mistake to blame Europe's energy problems solely on the war, as some do. Natural gas was cheap during the 2010s: lower in nominal terms in 2015 than it had been 10 years earlier, and falling even more by the end of the decade. But even as gas prices fell, electricity prices rose. The biggest reason is probably climate policy. European governments and the E.U. have committed the continent to an exceptionally demanding decarbonization schedule that runs far ahead of those of the United States or China. By 2030, European emissions must be at least 55 percent below where they were in 1990. National governments that do not act to bring this about can be prosecuted. Compare this to America, which merely seeks a nonbinding 50 percent to 52 percent reduction in emissions below its 2005 peak, which was higher than in 1990. China doesn't even plan for emissions to start falling until after 2030. Europe adopted a carbon pricing system in 2005. It now charges about six times more per ton of carbon than China does, and about 50 percent more than California. Most U.S. states do not price carbon emissions at all. From 2000 to 2020, European countries cut their coal use by more than half, and from 2010 to 2021 they shut down 80 gigawatts' worth of coal-fired power plants. Along with gas, most of the shortfall was made up by wind and solar, both of which are significantly subsidized by levies on energy bills. Many European states have responded to these high prices by subsidizing electricity for large users. As well as raising costs for other energy users, this has the effect of making it harder for smaller companies to compete with their larger rivals. Since such policies are unlikely to be sustainable for very long, they do little to keep these sectors going in the long run. The continued investment and entry they require depends on returns over a long time horizon. High energy costs have led to rolling sectoral recessions. A recent report into European competitiveness by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi estimated that output in Europe's four largest energy-intensive sectors—chemicals, basic metals, minerals, and paper—has fallen by over 10 percent in the past four years, following the rise in gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will cost half a trillion euros to decarbonize just these sectors. Decarbonizing shipping and aviation will cost a further 100 billion euros per year. Yet Europe's leaders have generally refused to accept that its green energy policies are this costly. Even the Draghi report, held by many to be the first serious attempt to acknowledge the continent's economic problems, claims that decarbonization is an opportunity "to take the lead in new clean technologies and circularity solutions." But Europe's eagerness to take the lead on decarbonization is the source of many of its troubles. If Europe's problems were limited to national policy errors, then in time you would expect economic activity to flow to islands of relative openness, such as Sweden and Denmark, just as bad policies in California and New York have driven people to Florida and Texas. That might even be how the E.U. is supposed to work. Its single market is often seen as the E.U.'s crowning achievement: a set of rules that are supposed to ensure the frictionless movement of goods, services, capital, and people across the borders of Europe's member states. But Luis Garicano, an economist and former member of European Parliament, argues that the single market has been left to decay—and sometimes has actually become a barrier to trade by adding new regulations on top of existing ones. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping law governing data use and privacy, is interpreted and enforced differently in each member state. In practice, this means that compliance with the law varies wildly across the bloc. Ireland, for example, approved Meta's data protection practices. But German and French GDPR regulators disagreed and levied fines of 390 million euros on the company. New antitrust powers introduced to govern Big Tech companies have been layered on top of national-level antitrust enforcement, creating multiple enforcers and contradictory sets of rules for the same conduct. This pattern repeats itself for every other flagship E.U. regulation, and is built into the design of the new AI Act. In total, the Union now has 270 different technology regulators. The Draghi report estimates the direct costs of rules being duplicated like this is some 200 billion euros per year. In other cases, the single market has simply been left unfinished. Professional qualifications, for example, are not recognized across European borders—when engineers based in Portugal win a contract for work in Germany, they face lengthy bureaucratic "equivalency checks" that stop them in practice from performing the work. National environmental regulations block products that are safely produced and used across the rest of the continent. Many important sectors, like finance and energy, are excluded from the single market altogether. The number of lawsuits brought against governments for single market infringements—the bread and butter of enforcing European free trade—has collapsed under the E.U.'s current leadership. Thierry Breton, who was internal market commissioner until last year, was supposed to work on breaking down these trade barriers but focused instead on fights with U.S. tech CEOs and stewarding the continent's AI regulations. This is hugely significant for Europe's economy. Trade within the E.U. is vast, and making it even slightly easier could have enormous benefits. The International Monetary Fund estimates that barriers to trade within the E.U. are equivalent to a 44 percent tariff on goods and a 110 percent tariff on services. According to Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist of the French bank BNP Paribas, "it would only take a 2.4 per cent increase in intra-EU trade to make up for a 20 per cent fall in exports to the US." This might also be a reason Europe's tech companies have struggled: Unlike their American or Chinese rivals, they do not have a large domestic market to sell into. The solution is simple. Rather than trying to harmonize regulations with a single rule book written in Brussels, trust that rules that are good enough for Swedish consumers are acceptable for Spanish ones too. If something is legal in one European country, you should be able to trade it and use it in all the others, provided it is clear where it comes from. "Mutual recognition" of this kind was supposed to be the basis of the single market. Restoring it would be one of the biggest trade liberalizations in world history. For all of Europe's longrunning economic problems, it was only after the Great Recession that the continent's economy really began to flatline. Meanwhile, America's recovered and continued to grow. What accounts for this sharp difference in performance? Tyler Goodspeed, former acting chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, points to the Basel III financial regulations, global rules set out after the 2008 financial crisis. These were intended to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis by curbing lending to businesses and requiring banks to hold more "safe" assets. Whether these measures actually increase financial stability is questionable, given that earlier iterations required banks to hold more mortgage debt than they wanted. With the Great Recession, that came to look like a mistake. Though the postcrisis Basel rules were adopted in the United States as well, their effect in Europe may have been particularly chilling for business lending. There are two reasons for that. One: Europe's banking system is much more consolidated than America's. The United States has thousands of smaller banks, which escape many of the strictest rules. European countries tend to be dominated by only a handful of much larger institutions. Two: Europe's businesses are far more dependent on bank lending for financing than America's are. In Europe, 68 percent of business financing comes from banks, compared to just 20 percent in the United States. America's much larger venture capital, private equity, and pension fund investors make restrictions on bank lending much less important than in Europe. Debt financing generally favors capital-intensive businesses, such as Sweden's H2 Green Steel, which raised 4.2 billion euros in debt last year to finance a hydrogen-fired steel mill. Software-based companies, which have little collateral to borrow against, tend to find it harder to get loans this way. This isn't a problem in Silicon Valley, which has access to America's $1.25 trillion in venture capital. If Goodspeed is right, Basel's tighter rules on lending could be a big reason that European startups have struggled to grow compared to their American peers. Fixing the problem need not mean adding more risk to European finance: Removing barriers to the sort of investments that American companies can access could be the answer. There are islands of success across the continent. The Dutch company ASML is the world's only manufacturer of the photolithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. European companies do well in sectors such as luxury fashion, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and tourism. Many of the most celebrated video games of recent years, from Baldur's Gate 3 to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, were developed in Europe. Soccer is the world's favorite sport, and Europe's teams and leagues dominate it. These are not sectors that win wars or excite advocates of industrial policy. But they are profitable, and they make our world better. Though their economies are relatively small, the E.U.'s postcommunist members have grown impressively since joining the bloc in the early 2000s. Poland and Hungary's GDPs per capita have more than doubled in real terms since 2000, though Hungary has stagnated in recent years. In Romania it has nearly tripled, though from a lower level after enduring a particularly evil and destructive communist regime. These states have their problems, but they also tend to be clearer-eyed about the need for economic dynamism than Western Europeans. The world needs a rich, prosperous Europe. For all the region's failings, private property rights and the rule of law are more strongly protected and cherished in Europe than in most states around the world. Those values are incredibly difficult to build where they do not exist. Compared to that, fixing a few of the most important elements of a continent's economic policy should be easy. Shifting Europeans away from Franco-German-style labor laws sounds impossible, but few Europeans fear the thought of being a bit more like Denmark. Combining decarbonization with energy abundance will become easier as nuclear, solar, and battery power get cheaper. Revitalizing the single market is a career-making project for an ambitious reformer. Less onerous financial regulation can be implemented without major political costs, especially when it means removing barriers to investment approaches that have worked well in America. Those changes won't repair all of Europe's problems—its welfare states, for example, would still need a significant overhaul to be solvent—but they could set the stage for further reforms. Bringing this complacent continent back to reality will not be easy, but it can be done. Europe chose to be poor. But that also means it can choose not to be.

Title: Media Stocks, Markets Soar As Fed Chief Signals September Rate Cut – “The Balance Of Risks Appears To Be Shifting”

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor It’s been a long wait but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell energized stocks today as he cracked open the door to a possible interest rate cut at the Central Bank’s September meeting. In his keynote address at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said that “the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” The Fed hasn’t cut rates since December of 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 800 points or 1.9% to close at a record. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% and the 1.9%. It was an upbeat finale to a dour week rattled by AI jitters that pounded tech stocks. They rallied today along with media. Warner Bros. Discovery rose 4%. Disney and Comcast closed up 2%. Related Stories News Donald Trump Is Asked By Reporter About Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce Engagement: "I Wish Them A Lot Of Luck" News Trump Media Expands In Crypto With New Venture Netflix was a hair lower. Paramount Skydance slipped as well after a massive run-up approaching meme stock status over the past few weeks. Deadline reported this afternoon that the newly merged company is planning thousands of layoffs. Watch on Deadline Exhibitors rose nicely led by AMC and Imax. Broadcasters posted gains amid M&A as Nexstar (up 1%) bid to acquire Tegna (flat). Charter, in the process of buying Cox, was up 4%. Amazon, Apple and Meta rose. Roku gained as shares from Sirius to Snap to Fubo. The Fed’s dual mandate is price stability and maximum employment. That’s been a major challenge as inflation went wild post-Covid and it took rate hike after hike to wrestle down toward the central bank’s traditional 2% benchmark. Powell said inflation risk is still “tilted to the upside” with tariff related price impacts now “clearly visible.” “We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem,” he said. However, the labor market is seeing “a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” he said. He called it an unusual situation which “suggests that downside risks to employment are rising” and that “the balance of risks appears to be shifting.” There’s been a lot of noise around U.S. economic indicators. President Donald Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner late last month after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near halt. The president also wants lower interest rates and has publicly lambasted Powell, frequently threatening to eject the chairman before his term ends next spring. Markets don’t react well when he does that so he’s always backed down. Trump is, however, calling for the resignation of Fed Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. Trump loyalist Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage — a controversy that is hanging over the Jackson Hole event.

Title: Lost Money on Novo Nordisk A/S(NVO)? Join Class Action Suit Seeking Recovery – Contact Levi & Korsinsky

Full Content:
August 22, 2025 16:44 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=162780&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: Claude AI For Retirement Investing: Project Your Future And Analyze Accounts
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/claude-ai-retirement-investing-project-future-analyze-accounts/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T17:00:47Z
Full Content:
ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. Retirement planning is a challenge for many Americans, requiring deep reading, organization of tools, selection of the right accounts and investments and ongoing management. With the rise of AI, including Claude by Anthropic, one of the most advanced AI tools on the market, retirement planning is experiencing a shakeup as more investors look to AI to answer their investing questions, optimize their portfolios and set a financial plan for the future. This article will investigate the promise and reality of Claude AI for retirement investing, including how to use it for planning, analyzing your holdings and assisting you with investing. It will also help you understand the limits of Claude’s capabilities. Retirement planning has traditionally operated by investors either managing their own retirement planning with an array of tools like spreadsheets or software, or by investors delegating planning to financial advisors to manage investing for them. AI is disrupting this process by providing more analysis and ideas, all through a simple chat interface, or by allowing investors to build their own tools within AI tools with just simple writing. AI can provide insights, run data, predict risk and provide alternate retirement strategies to investors for free. Many investors simply want to leave retirement planning to a professional who can manage day-to-day investing, choose tax-optimized strategies and give peace of mind that an expert is at the helm, all for a fee. For do-it-yourself investors or those who may not have been so bold previously, AI can provide personalized recommendations, tell investors what they’re missing and assist with investment decisions as a retirement planning partner. As AI increasingly integrates within a growing number of people’s personal and professional workflows, using it for retirement planning is becoming an essential new tool in the investment stack. Claude is a popular AI assistant helping individuals and teams code, solve problems, write and search more intelligently. It is also being used as an investing assistant, providing answers to a host of money questions from “What are the best AI stocks for 2025?” to “Which retirement account should I contribute to first?” With so many AI tools on the market, it’s important to know the strengths, weaknesses and features of each, including Claude AI. Claude AI is a large language model (LLM) created by Anthropic, a company composed of many former ChatGPT engineers, designed to provide a safe and accurate AI experience to users. With guardrails for safety as well as a powerful engine built by some of the best AI creators, Claude has many use cases from software creation to retirement planning assistance. Claude, like other LLMs, personalizes the conversation with its users, helping it to provide ideal answers, better understand your context and deliver a superior experience, whether you’re asking for retirement tips or writing an important email to a coworker. Claude is disrupting retirement investing, as it is with other work like software engineering, by serving as a partner and workhorse on tasks you need done. This LLM can help investors understand how to optimize their portfolio, recommend investments, run analyses on prospective investments and help you make effective decisions based on your long-term plan. It can also serve as a partner in educating you on potential risky investments, dissuade you from making a poor decision like selling during a crash and build you a full retirement plan that adjusts over time. A smart use case of LLMs like Claude is estimating how your portfolio may perform in the future based on scenarios and variables like contributions. Claude will offer potential scenarios and ask questions to gauge your long-term needs and how your portfolio can support them. By setting goals, checking out scenarios and gauging variables that could affect performance with Claude, you can be better prepared for retirement. Whether you’re planning to retire early, work a side job in retirement, plan to have additional dependents or just need help knowing how to spend your money, Claude can help you set retirement goals. The LLM can ask you questions to let you know all the variables you’ll need to spend money on, help you set savings targets and let you know if there are any variables you’re not considering. Claude can also surface risks you didn’t even consider or potential options to let your portfolio last longer, like an ideal state to live in or government benefits to apply for. Claude and other LLMs love running scenarios and helping you understand all the possibilities — even those you didn’t consider for your portfolio. For example, you might consider your portfolio and retirement plan to be conservative but it could share a bear-case scenario where you might not have enough to retire. Claude can also provide suggestions to make your plan more fool-proof and the steps you need to take to make your retirement successful. Retirement calculators have popularized the ability to visualize how even minor changes to your investing journey can make a difference. Likewise Claude can help you understand how a potential portfolio may look if you invest more when you’re young or how much in contributions it would take if you start late. It can also provide suggestions on how to optimize your retirement contributions and how to ensure you save more as you earn more without succumbing to lifestyle creep. An excellent use case of Claude AI is granularly considering your portfolios’ makeup, providing useful suggestions about where you’re taking too much risk or holding onto an asset which may continue to drag down your performance. By feeding it statements or portfolio makeup, it can weigh it based on your age, time to retirement and other important details. Optimization recommendations from Claude can be based on consensus wisdom, its own fundamental analysis and the latest literature on retirement planning. A Claude analysis of your retirement accounts can tell you where you should contribute more to your 401(k), traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For example, if you live and work in a high-tax state but plan to retire in a low-tax state, it may recommend investing more in a traditional 401(k) or IRA over a Roth. It can also make recommendations like investing more in IRAs if your 401(k) fund options are high-fee, or more in a 401(k) if your company offers a high match. When analyzing your portfolio, Claude can also analyze your holdings to see if any of funds or ETFs are high-fee and should be substituted out. By simply feeding in your portfolio and asking for optimization offerings based on your goals and life plans, it can provide useful suggestions. If you’re overindexed in a particular sector, it could provide rebalancing recommendations; if you’re not taking sufficient risk for your age, it could suggest lowering exposure to bonds. Claude can also flag where you’re invested in low performers, like a sector ETF or stock that should be sold for more broad exposure or a new growth opportunity. LLMs are excellent at this sort of analysis and can highlight where your money could be working more efficiently. By utilizing LLMs, you can be told the real cost of holding on to dead weight assets, and be recommended for better opportunities for your retirement. Another core strength of Claude is recommending ideal asset allocations based on your timeline or ability to bear risk. For example, if it knows you’re young with many years to invest and grow your holdings, it could recommend a more equity heavy portfolio or taking on growth stocks in a percentage of your portfolio for massive upside. It can also recommend less risky assets or the best possible opportunities for income generation if you’re in or approaching retirement. Claude AI can provide a range of benefits for retirement planning, from lightning quick analysis of data and deep research into particular stocks and analyst ratings, to cold, unemotional perspectives on certain situations. As mentioned, Claude is excellent at running numbers, making it ideal to analyze disclosures, statements and fundamentals of stocks. It can also provide advice on particular situations. For example, if you’re considering using margin to invest in a risky asset, it can provide you with advice on whether this could be successful based on previous performance, analysts’ perceptions of this asset and percentage chance of failure. Often LLMs will caveat advice and will readily provide different scenarios where a strategy could or could not be successful, within seconds. Instead of spending hours on research and calculations, Claude can run a simulation of financial scenarios quickly, read and explain reports very quickly and is always available to assist you with your questions. For investors who have a grounding in investing concepts and know-how managing a portfolio, Claude is a fantastic partner. LLMs are highly time efficient and can be asked to run new analyses and projections even when you’re not interacting with them, updating you on new developments and providing helpful suggestions. Investing can be a highly emotional activity, as you’re risking your hard-earned money to earn a return, be prepared for retirement and beat inflation. LLMs like Claude can soberly tell you if you’re making a foolish mistake, grounded in probability and against hard research from multiple sources. Just as a financial advisor can keep you grounded in not selling too quickly or trusting an unvetted source, so too can Claude provide unemotional advice to prevent you from making an unnecessary mistake. While Claude is an exceptionally powerful tool, it can’t replace the professional expertise of a financial advisor who is licensed and knows your financial situation. When using it as a non-professional, you may provide inaccurate information, not provide essential information or the tool may make mistakes that might affect the actions it recommends. In addition, issues still persist with AI platforms, like inappropriate use of data or poor predictions based on old or incomplete financial data. One limitation to using Claude for retirement investing over a licensed financial advisor or your own spreadsheets is potential concerns over data privacy and security. Data breaches can occur on less secure platforms, or if you’re using Claude over an unsafe network. There hasn’t been a data breach on a major AI platform like Claude yet, but concerns remain over how these platforms may utilize information or if it could pass data to a different user through its memory. Another limitation is that while AI is highly intelligent, markets can still behave irrationally and Claude and other LLMs cannot predict the future. A pandemic or geopolitical crisis could throw a particular market into chaos, breaking previous trends an LLM conservatively thinks may continue, or affect an asset class considered otherwise safe. Predictions of LLMs should be considered as suggestions and not perfect, just as you would be cautious with financial advice from anyone else. While LLMs like Claude can base their predictions or analysis on data sets and consensus views, they’re not licensed professionals equipped to fully manage your portfolio. A financial advisor must pass exams and be deemed worthy of managing portfolios by licensing entities, which brings understanding of regulations, client relationships and complicated situations. By utilizing an LLM alongside a financial advisor, you can get the best of both worlds of retirement planning: human expertise as well as an LLM’s suggestions for questions and insights for a segment of your portfolio. AI will likely disrupt retirement planning into the future, as the models become more intelligent and widely used, gain access to more data and are more broadly marketed to investors. In the short-term, AI will be used more widely for investing questions and helping with portfolio analysis and recommendations. It is and will continue to be used for scenario planning, like knowing where to invest based on short and long-term goals, based on factors like your salary, current portfolio and future retirement plans. In the long-term, AI will be more broadly adopted by financial firms and analysts as the models are packaged by firms for their teams’ use, serving as junior analysts and useful tools for financial advisors. This will be helpful for gauging optimal portfolios for each of their clients’ unique needs and situations. With time, AI may become intelligent and competent enough to fully replace financial advisors, using inputs and having sufficient regulatory support to manage portfolios. Bottom Line As one of the most advanced models, Claude has tremendous promise for helping you with your retirement planning, whether you need to find opportunities for a higher return, optimize for tax efficiency or just reduce emotional decision making. While Claude isn’t yet a replacement for financial advisors, it’s making it easy for self-starters to improve their retirement planning as a financial planning partner, and improving the ways in which investors can work with a human advisor. Through personalization, deep research capabilities and thoughtful prompting, Claude is an excellent tool for investors to better prepare for their financial future. Can Claude AI Replace A Financial Advisor For Retirement Planning? No, Claude AI can’t replace a financial advisor for retirement planning, but it can provide intelligent suggestions and insights, improving your retirement planning when paired with a professional financial advisor. Is My Financial Data Safe When Using Claude AI? Claude AI prides itself on AI safety and is considered a secure platform, but you should always be careful with providing confidential financial data through LLMs and carefully read data policies of the AI platforms you use. Does Claude AI Work with All Retirement Accounts? Claude AI can analyze documents and data you feed it from retirement accounts, but doesn’t yet offer direct connection to retirement accounts. How Often Should I Update My Plan With Claude AI? If you’ve developed a retirement plan with ClaudeAI, you should update it at least once a year to provide updated information on investment performance, life changes or changed plans to optimize your plan.

Lucid Group (LCID) said it will proceed with plans for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, as the unprofitable EV startup looks to boost its share price. In a reverse stock split, a company cuts the number of its outstanding shares and increases the per-share price proportionally. Lucid said the number of authorized shares of common stock will be reduced to 1.5 billion from 15 billion following the reverse split, with the shares set to start trading on an adjusted basis on Sept. 2. Lucid shares were little changed in recent trading and have lost more than 30% of their value this year amid worries about its outlook and the anticipated phaseout of EV tax credits under the "One Big Beautiful Bill" signed into law by President Trump in July. Earlier this month, Lucid reduced its 2025 production guidance to between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles for 2025, from 20,000 previously. The EV company last month launched a partnership with Uber Technologies (UBER) and self-driving software maker Nuro aimed at developing robotaxis and bringing them to Uber's network.

Title: AI dominates 2025 Future of Memory and Storage conference

Getty Images/iStockphoto How will today's AI boom affect storage and new technologies? Earlier this month, the Future of Memory and Storage conference, formerly Flash Memory Summit, sought to address those questions. For the most part, the different nature of AI workloads combined with the significant size of the market creates needs for new ways of moving data between processing and memory. Here's a look at presenters' descriptions of AI's importance to the storage market and some of the technologies that could accommodate the shift from conventional to AI workloads. More than 200 speakers gathered in Santa Clara, Calif., at the Future of Memory and Storage. To set the stage, many presenters showed their versions of a chart dramatizing hyperscale data centers' enormous spending on AI hardware, similar to the one below. Some estimate that AI spending could surpass $4 trillion by 2030. The most recent quarter's spend was $99 billion, indicating that 2025 annual spending should exceed $400 billion. Nearly everyone highlighted the power requirements of such systems and the difficult effect they might have on the grid. Some even spoke of small nuclear power plants that certain hyperscalers are said to consider as an alternative to purchasing energy from established firms. But something that seems to be widely overlooked is the sustainability of this level of spending. In a presentation of my own, I reasoned that it's perfectly justifiable for spending to increase as long as revenue increases justify that move. However, I then illustrated that hyperscaler spending for six leading firms -- Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft Azure -- has risen from a relatively steady 12% to 14% of revenue to roughly double that at 25% of revenue in the most recently reported quarter. It's hard to imagine that this pace can be offset by today's layoffs of engineers whose jobs are to be replaced by AI. It's more reasonable to expect to see a cooling-off period soon where these companies ease back on capital spending, which is likely to lead to a downturn in the storage and chip businesses. Typically, all these companies tend to increase or decrease capital spending together, leading to relatively serious supply and demand mismatches when they do. Vendors revealed many new technologies at the Future of Memory and Storage show because AI manages data differently than conventional workloads. Nearly every SSD maker either demonstrated or disclosed 100 TB and larger SSDs. Samsung presented a behemoth of greater than 200 TB, and Sandisk promised a 512 TB SSD in 2027. Many of these SSDs will ship in the new E1.L "ruler" form factor for reasons of both capacity and heat dissipation. The motivation behind these monster SSDs is that Meta published their finding that performance could be improved by inserting a new layer of QLC SSDs between their TLC SSDs and their HDDs. It's somewhat ironic that this new layer will have a lower total capacity than the HDD layer but will be made from SSDs whose individual capacity will be an order of magnitude larger than the HDDs they cache. Other vendors at the Future of Memory and Storage showed unique approaches to AI. Two that I found particularly interesting were Solidigm's new approach to a hot-swappable liquid-cooled SSD and Phison's SSD designed specifically to reduce cost for large language model (LLM) systems. Users can insert Solidigm's SSD into a front-panel slot, just like its air-cooled counterpart, using a special third-party rack that presses liquid-cooled plates against the SSDs. The SSDs are designed to take as much advantage as possible by incorporating internal heat management that balances the heat dissipation between the front and back of the SSD. The Phison Pascari SSD has been designed for an extraordinarily heavy write load, boasting endurance of 100 drive writes per day. AI training workloads are very write-intensive. Phison's engineers reasoned that GPU performance scales with memory size, meaning high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM, and proper management of this memory along with the use of cheaper NAND flash, can support large models with a lower number of GPUs than normal. Phison's combined hardware and software approach to this problem, dubbed "aiDAPTIV+," allows a single GPU to support LLMs at a somewhat slower performance than a multiple-GPU system at a significantly lower cost. A couple of companies also shared plans to introduce high-performance AI-specific SSDs boasting 100 million IOPS throughputs. Some questioning revealed that this target, apparently presented to them by their hyperscale customers, was not the standard 4K IOPS that is normally used to compare today's SSDs against one another. Instead, since AI deals with smaller data granularity, the new AI-specific SSDs will feed GPUs with 100 million 512-byte IOPS, which would presumably be easier to achieve within a given I/O bandwidth. Note that I didn't say that it would be easy, just easier than supplying 100 million 4K IOPS. The leading SSD suppliers are accepting the challenge, though, which implies that they expect to achieve that goal in production volumes. Sandisk illustrated a different approach to the size and cost challenges posed by HBM. The company is working on a new high-bandwidth flash (HBF), which should replace some, but not all, of the DRAM-based HBM stacks within a GPU complex. While today's NAND chips are optimized for cost, HBF will be optimized for read bandwidth. It will still have a decided cost advantage over DRAM, with a similar read bandwidth. The laws of physics prevent write bandwidth from improving, so HBF will be a good platform for inference but not for training, because training has a relatively balanced number of HBM reads and writes, while inference is read-intensive. In a February investor conference, when this technology was first disclosed, Sandisk shared the image below. Although the diagram on the right of the image indicates that a single HBF NAND die should behave like 16 individual chips, Sandisk representatives told me that they weren't disclosing what the actual number might be. The company did share that their models show the performance of a GPU with an unlimited amount of HBF NAND flash came within about 3% of the performance of a similar GPU with an unlimited amount of DRAM-based HBM. In the long run, new technologies will fuel today's amazing AI growth and a pipeline of new ideas will help improve AI in the future. All the industry needs to do now is deliver those offerings and protect itself from any pause in AI spending that might happen in coming quarters. Expect to see these technologies in the future, either sooner, as long as AI spending keeps up, or later, should there be a correction.

Title: Tariff Shock And Reversal: Finding Value In Industrial Leaders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbuckingham/2025/08/22/tariff-shock-and-reversal-finding-value-in-industrial-leaders/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T16:06:04Z

ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. In my last column I wrote about how volatility is the price of admission for long-term wealth creation. Policy shakeups were the predominant reason for the volatility in the first half of 2025. In April, President Trump declared “Liberation Day” for trade, unveiling sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every major U.S. trading partner. Markets recoiled. The S&P 500 dropped more than 12% in a week, while Value and Growth stocks alike fell sharply. I often like to point investors to Lao Tzu’s quote that says, “If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading." Faced with political and business backlash, the administration rolled back or delayed several of its harshest provisions, and stocks moved toward recovery. By June’s end the S&P had rebounded 25% from the April lows. Tariff costs are real and can weigh on profits, but companies with strong competitive advantages usually find ways to adapt. Also, the volatility created by policy shocks often resets valuations and creates opportunity for disciplined buyers. I think the experiences for Deere, Caterpillar and Eaton all illustrate these points. Deere (DE) absorbed a $200 million tariff hit in its fiscal Q3 and expects $600 million in costs for the year. Large Agriculture sales fell 16%, yet management still projects net income in the range of $4.75 to $5.25 billion this year. Deere’s ability to proactively manage inventory, improve dealer networks and advance precision technologies like See & Spray shows how even in a tougher environment the company remains well positioned. Caterpillar (CAT) also faced pressure, with Q2 revenue down 4% to $17.3 billion. Despite the hit, margins improved to 21.3% and backlog grew by $2.5 billion. Management acknowledged tariffs will weigh on profitability, but strength in infrastructure and power generation has the Street expecting a return to sales growth in FY 2026. Caterpillar continues to generate robust free cash flow and remains a dominant force in heavy machinery. Eaton (ETN) provides a different perspective. The power-management leader posted record Q2 EPS of $2.95, up 8% from a year ago, driven by strong orders in Electrical Americas. Management now expects 12% EPS growth for 2025 at the midpoint. Even with some cyclical softness, Eaton is positioned to benefit from megatrends like electrification, reindustrialization and defense spending. Tariffs add uncertainty, and they can squeeze margins and create volatility that resets valuations. Still, firms like Deere, Caterpillar and Eaton show that competitively advantage companies can lean on their backlogs, pricing power and strategic flexibility to adapt. For long-term investors, policy shocks are not necessarily reasons to sell. More often, they are chances to lean into resilient businesses built to thrive once the dust settles. ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NOVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Apple Steve Jobs billionaire net worth: Steve Jobs, despite being synonymous with tech giant Apple, surprisingly attained billionaire status through Pixar. After being ousted from Apple, Jobs acquired Lucasfilm's graphics division, renaming it Pixar. The triumph of 'Toy Story' movie in 1995 and Pixar's subsequent IPO helped increase Jobs' net worth.

Title: Poll: 71% of Americans Fear AI Will Put People Out of Work 'Permanently'

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that Americans are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment stability. Reuters reports that rapid advancements in AI have taken the world by storm beginning with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. While the technology has been met with enthusiasm by many, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has shed light on the growing concerns among Americans regarding AI’s impact on jobs and politics. The poll found that a staggering 71 percent of respondents feared that AI would “permanently displace” too many workers. Although the current U.S. jobless rate stands at a low 4.2 percent, the potential for AI to reshape industries and eliminate jobs has become a pressing concern for many Americans. Some fields are already feeling the pinch. Breitbart News previously reported that computer science graduates are having a tough time finding work as companies use AI to automate entry-level positions: The allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. The military applications of AI have also raised eyebrows, with 48 percent of respondents stating that the government should never use the technology to determine targets for military strikes. Only 24 percent supported such use, while 28 percent remained undecided. AI has also faced criticism for applications that have allowed AI bots to engage in romantic conversations with children, generate false medical information, and assist in making racist arguments. Two-thirds of respondents expressed worry that people would abandon human relationships in favor of AI companions. For example, one woman claims she is now engaged to an AI chatbot. Opinions were divided on whether AI would improve education, with 36 percent believing it would help, 40 percent disagreeing, and the rest remaining uncertain. Read more at Reuters here.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout.

But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis.

Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»Showcase»I Tested 7 AI Tools for Content Marketing: Here’s What I Found By Nouman Yaqoob | August 20, 2025 | Reader Disclosure I have been using AI tools since ChatGPT first launched. And like many content marketers, I wanted to improve my skills for the AI era. This means I frequently test a wide range of AI tools as part of my actual content marketing workflow. This regular testing has helped me move past the noise and identify which tools genuinely save time and improve content quality for other bloggers and marketers. My goal was to find what helps drive traffic and engagement, not just add another subscription to the list. In this guide, I’ll share that clarity with you. Here are my recommendations for the best AI tools for content marketers, based on my daily use and the results I got from them. If you are in a hurry, here is a quick list of all the AI tools I use in my daily workflow as a content marketer: TL:DR Summary: Draft content with ChatGPT, verify with Gemini, optimize with AIOSEO, build in SeedProd, design in Canva, create a video with Runway, and add voiceovers with ElevenLabs. Next, I’ll show how I tested each tool and why you can trust my picks. The AI industry is exploding with innovation, making it harder to separate hype from reality, and choosing the wrong tool can waste time and money. I aim to cut through the noise with real-world usage to save time and money. Here’s a breakdown of my testing process: As a content creator at WPBeginner, I use marketing tools daily to create and promote content for our millions of readers. Our team also uses plugins like All in One SEO and SeedProd across our business, so we have direct, first-hand experience with how their AI features perform. Furthermore, everyone at WPBeginner follows a strict editorial process to ensure our reviews are always thorough, fair, and trustworthy. My recommendations come from hands-on experience and a commitment to helping you find the right tools to succeed. Best For: Content writing, brainstorming, illustrations, and organizing marketing workflows. ChatGPT is one of the most versatile AI tools I’ve used. It works well for quick idea generation, long-form articles, and even creative media like images. As one of the most advanced AI companies, OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is spending huge resources on research and innovation. This means more capable and faster models are released quite frequently. ChatGPT allows you to switch between search, chat, deep research, and agent modes so you can perform different types of tasks from the same window. How I use ChatGPT: ChatGPT is my primary AI for a variety of tasks. I use it daily for updating existing articles, brainstorming blog post ideas, writing new articles, and more. I learned that using Projects and ChatGPT’s memory feature allows the AI to learn my preferred tone, structure, and formatting rules. This saves me a lot of time in the long run. I also use it to create illustrations for articles and general blog images. It sometimes misspells words in images, but I can easily correct those using Photoshop or Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: A free plan is available with limited model access. Paid plan starts at $20/month, GPT-5, memory features, faster responses, and priority access during peak times. Best For: In-depth research, fact-checking, and writing technical or data-driven content. While ChatGPT is my go-to for creative tasks, Gemini is my trusted research assistant. Its biggest advantage is its direct, real-time integration with the Google search index, which means the information it provides is current and often comes with source links. This makes it incredibly reliable for tasks where accuracy is critical. I’ve found its ability to understand and explain complex, technical subjects is second to none. It’s also excellent at generating structured data like tables and comparing information from multiple sources. Plus, Google is continually updating Gemini with its latest AI models and connecting it with its ecosystem of Google Workspace apps like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. These integrations make it a powerful productivity hub. How I use Gemini: I turn to Gemini whenever I need to write content that requires up-to-date information or fact-checking. For instance, when writing a review of a new software release, I’ll ask Gemini to summarize the latest features, find recent user reviews, and compare its pricing to competitors. I also use it to simplify technical topics. When working on an article about website security, I can ask Gemini to explain “what is a DDoS attack” in a simple analogy that a non-technical reader can understand. Its ability to provide sourced information saves me a significant amount of research time. Related Article: See my pick of the best ChatGPT alternatives. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: The standard Gemini model is free to use. To access the most powerful models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) and larger context windows, you can subscribe to Google AI Pro, which starts at $19.99/month as part of the Google One AI Pro plan. Best For: Creating SEO-optimized titles, meta descriptions, FAQs, key points, and social media posts directly inside WordPress. All in One SEO’s AI Content Generator is built right into your WordPress dashboard, making it incredibly easy to create ranking-ready content without switching between tools. You can instantly generate: Because it’s part of the AIOSEO plugin, all the AI-generated content can be inserted into your post or page with a single click. This helps you save time and ensure everything is properly optimized for search engines and engagement. How I use AIOSEO AI Content Generator: I use AIOSEO’s AI content generator when I need to speed up the optimization process for new and updated articles. For example, after writing a post, I’ll use the AI Content Generator to create a compelling meta description, add FAQ blocks for featured snippets, and generate a TL;DR section to improve readability. It’s also my go-to for creating platform-specific social media captions. I can generate tailored copy for Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and X (Twitter) in seconds, which saves me from rewriting the same message multiple times. Plus, I love its Marketing Email feature, which allows you to instantly generate an email based on the content of your article. Note: All in One SEO is the most comprehensive WordPress SEO tool. We use it on all our websites, including WPBeginner. To learn more, see our full AIOSEO review. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Available for both Lite and Pro users. Lite users get 100 free credits, with additional credits available for purchase. Pro users get generous credits included with their license. All users can buy extra credits at any time. Best For: Creating landing page copy, headlines, and unique images directly inside the WordPress page builder. SeedProd is one of the most popular WordPress website and landing page builders. Alongside its drag-and-drop builder, it comes with built-in AI tools for text and image creation. It integrates with ChatGPT for copywriting and DALL·E for generating images, so you can create a complete, custom landing page without ever leaving the editor. The AI assistant is available inside many SeedProd blocks, letting you generate text or rework existing copy with just a click. You can also instantly translate your page content into 50+ languages and fine-tune tone and style with over 30 options, from professional to playful. Plus, you can even use SeedProd to create an entire website from scratch. For details, see our guide on how to create a WordPress website with AI. How I use SeedProd’s AI features: I use SeedProd’s AI writing assistant when I’m building landing pages or product pages and need polished copy fast. Instead of starting from scratch, I can select a block, click “Generate AI Text,” and have a strong starting draft instantly. For visual content, I use the AI image generator to create custom illustrations or hero images that match the page’s theme. If I don’t like the first result, then I can create multiple variations until I find the perfect fit. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: SeedProd offers a free plan for its page builder. AI writing and image generation are available on premium plans as a paid add-on. Pricing starts at $39.50/year for the base builder, with AI features included in higher tiers. Best For: Image editing, quick social media graphics, and AI-powered visual content creation. Canva is already one of the easiest tools for creating designs, but its Magic Studio AI features take it to another level with AI-powered image editing and media generation. It’s perfect for marketers who need professional visuals without advanced design skills. From background removal to text-to-image, text-to-video generation, Canva’s AI tools save time while expanding creative possibilities. Canva’s Magic Studio is powered by a mix of its own AI technology and models from leading partners like Google. This allows it to offer powerful image and video generation tools right inside the Canva editor as an all-in-one design solution. How I use Canva Magic Studio: I use Canva for creating and editing blog images, social media graphics, and quick promotional materials. The Magic Eraser is a huge time-saver when I need to remove unwanted elements from a photo, and the Expand tool is perfect for adjusting aspect ratios. I often tweak AI-generated visuals with Canva’s design tools for a polished final product. In particular, I use it to edit images generated with ChatGPT or Gemini because those platforms don’t have the same image editing capabilities as Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited AI features. The Pro plan starts at $4.58 /month and includes Magic Studio AI tools, brand kits, premium templates, and unlimited background removal. Best For: AI-powered video creation, editing, and special effects. Runway is one of the most innovative AI tools for marketers who need professional-quality video without a production crew. It offers text-to-video generation, background replacement, and advanced editing features, all inside a simple browser interface. I am not a video editor, but as part of a marketing team, I sometimes need quick videos. Runway is a great option for creating product promos, social media clips, and creative visuals that stand out in your campaigns. You can even start from an image or video clip and transform it entirely with AI. How I use Runway: I’ve used Runway to try out quick video clips and fun personal projects. I thoroughly tested Runway Aleph against Google’s Veo-3 (limited preview available in Gemini). Runway performed quite well and, in some areas, exceeded Veo. I also liked Runway’s ease-of-use, storyboard, and remix features. As someone with limited video editing experience, I found Runway to be much easier to use than Veo. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited exports and watermarks. Paid plans start at $12/month, offering higher-quality output, faster rendering, and commercial usage rights. Best For: Creating natural, human-like voiceovers for videos, podcasts, and marketing content. I discovered ElevenLabs when our WPBeginner YouTube team was trying it out for their videos and shorts. It is one of the most advanced AI voice generation platforms I’ve tested. Its voices sound remarkably realistic, with natural pacing, emotional nuance, and subtle inflections that make them almost indistinguishable from real human narrators. With support for over 70 languages (in the upcoming Eleven V3 model) and a library of 120+ pre-built voices, it’s a flexible tool for any marketer looking to add professional-quality audio to their content. You can also fine-tune voices with precision controls to match your brand tone or creative style. How I use ElevenLabs: I first used ElevenLabs for a quick AI video experiment. It was a fun non-work project, but I was hooked. I am not a podcaster or video editor, and don’t have any professional audio equipment. ElevenLabs came as a blessing to easily add quick narrations to short videos. For example, I can paste a pre-written script for a video, choose a voice that fits the tone, then adjust stability and style sliders for a polished delivery. I then use Audacity to edit audio for my videos to add pauses and music. I’ve also used its multi-language support to quickly generate audio for a personal project. The new Eleven V3 model surprised me. It was able to distinguish Urdu from Hindi (two almost identical South Asian languages), and the pronunciation was surprisingly good. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan includes 10,000 characters/month. Paid plans start at $5/month with higher character limits, faster generation, and access to voice cloning. For daily content creation, the $22/month plan is the most practical choice. AI moves fast. New features arrive every month, and “best” depends on your workflow, budget, and goals. Use these quick checks to pick tools that fit how you work today while staying flexible for tomorrow. I have shared the tools that I use daily and are part of my workflows as a content marketer. Here are some more tools that I use quite frequently. The following are some of the most common questions that I hear from WPBeginner users on Reddit and LinkedIn. Which AI tool is best for beginners? If you’re starting out, I recommend ChatGPT. It’s versatile, easy to learn, and has a free plan so you can practice without spending money. Do I need to pay for AI tools to get good results? Not always. Many AI tools, like ChatGPT and Canva, have free tiers that work well for smaller projects. Paid plans usually offer faster responses, higher quality outputs, and more advanced features. Can AI tools replace human writers and designers? AI tools are great for speeding up tasks and sparking ideas, but they can’t fully replace human creativity and judgment. I still review and edit everything to make sure it fits my style and is factually correct. How do I know if an AI tool is right for me? Check if the tool solves a problem you face often, offers a free trial, and integrates with your existing workflow. If it saves you time or improves quality without adding complexity, then it’s worth keeping. Will AI tools keep getting better? Yes. The AI industry is evolving fast. Expect new features, better accuracy, and more integrations over the next few years. That’s why I suggest testing tools regularly to see if better options appear. These AI tools help me plan, write, design, and publish faster while keeping quality high. You can start with the free plans, test on one real task, and keep the tools that save you time without adding extra steps. Just make sure to keep human editing and fact-checking in the loop so your content stays accurate and on brand.

Title: The Stock Market Is In A Bubble, When Will It Burst?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2025/08/22/the-stock-market-is-in-a-bubble-when-will-it-burst/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T09:58:49Z
Full Content:
ByMike O'Sullivan, Senior Contributor. I’ve spent a bit of the summer re-reading the work of Charles Kindleberger, an important economist whose career intersected monetary systems and stock market bubbles, two issues that are top of mind for investors and economists today (see last week’s note ‘Stable Genius’). Kindleberger had an interesting career. His PhD advisor at Columbia was Henry Parker Willis (a key architect of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and the first Secretary of the Federal Reserve Board that became what we now know as the ‘Fed’). Then in one of his first jobs at the US Treasury, Kindleberger worked for Harry Dexter White, the interlocutor and ‘rival’ of JM Keynes at the Breton Woods conference. To that end, Kindleberger had a very strong sense of the creation of the monetary infrastructure that has built today’s economic world, and he then had the opportunity to play a role in this as one of the architects of the Marshall Plan, which did so much to spur growth in post-war Europe and to cement the view of the USA as the benevolent world power. Benn Steil’s book ‘The Marshall Plan: The Dawn of the Cold War’ is worth a read. Beyond his policy work, Kindleberger is best known for ‘Mania’s, Panics and Crashes’, the best outline of how asset bubbles form and are followed by crashes. It is highly pertinent today because a variety of stock market valuation indicators (the long-term ‘Shiller Price Earnings ratio’, the ‘Buffet Indicator’ as well as measures of market concentration – the largest ten stocks account for 75% of the entire market), point to the kind of market behaviour seen only in market bubbles (like 2001). Consistent with this, various investors, as well as entrepreneurs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman are warning of a ‘bubble’. One test of the bubble thesis is to follow Kindleberger’s theory that asset price bubbles follow a common speculative cycle. According to Kindleberger, bubbles often start with an innovation – in a technology (i.e. railways) or a financial policy or market structure, or even a growth ‘miracle’ (note all the Tiger economies from Hong Kong to Ireland have seen boom/bust cycles) towards which investors channel capital, and then even more as asset prices rise and a narrative around the ‘mania’ begins to build. This effect helps to loosen the strings of the overall economy and financial sector, but around this point asset prices are reaching incredulous levels as investor euphoria intensifies, drawing in further speculation, until prices then turn down, and the house of cards collapses in a crash. The collapse is always greater when households, institutions and individuals have borrowed on the back of high asset prices, and logically there is greater contagion across the economy. One lesson from the Kindleberger book is that ‘new’ things – inventions or economic policy liberalizations often provide the spark for a new speculative bubble, that can grow and destabilise a financial system if enough speculative capital is driven towards it. AI is a case in point. For context, Morgan Stanley estimates that over USD 3 trillion will be invested in AI related infrastructure (data centres, energy), with about half of that coming from the cashflow of the large technology companies, and the rest from private credit. It is clear that the large technology firms (from Microsoft to Nvidia) are the driving force behind this boom, especially so in the context of the fiscal weakness of most Western governments. The recent results season was instructive in this respect. Often in a bubble, the dot.com one being a good example, the earnings associated with the bubble are only ‘prospective’ or somehow inflated. This is not the case with the large technology firms so far – by and large they report very strong earnings, which helps to soften the bubble argument. The catch is the circularity of the capital expenditure by the large technology firms – META for example is spending aggressively on data centres and chips and running down its cash levels. To that extent, the large tech firms are making a bold bet to get ahead in the AI game, but it is a concentrated and possibly existential bet. If the strong cashflow position of the firms at the centre of this bubble is unusual in the context of the Kindleberger framework, two other factors also stand out as untypical. The first is that short- and long-term interest rates in the major economies are close to ‘neutral’, neither too hot not too cold. Bubbles are often characterised, or preceded by ‘easy money’, though it has to be recognised that the last decade has been one of near continual stimulus (from QE to fiscal spending). The other unusual factor is that the stock bubble is occurring against a backdrop of intense geopolitical and economic policy uncertainty – from great power competition to an unravelling trade order to a reconfiguring of America’s role in the world. The one way in which these dislocations fit the bubble narrative is that AI is a strategic asset, a ‘must-have’, that leads to an environment where for example the US government aims to take a strategic stake in Intel. Having written in early 2024 of a ‘Bubble Brewing’, I think we are now ‘in’ an AI centric market bubble, though not at the end of it in the sense of there being a ‘mania’ proper. In the short term, we might well see a wobble in AI stocks, before they pick up again. In a future note I will detail my own experiences of the dot.com and European real estate bubbles, which lead me to think that ‘we are not there yet’ in terms of the evolution of this bubble. It will end with the absurd – Nvidia encroaching on a USD 10 trn valuation, food companies publicly adopting AI and seeing their values double, wild predictions that AI can treble productivity and wipe out the debt, and on the flip side, the structural risks to energy and jobs markets that AI could pose. But, we are not there yet. Have a great week ahead, Mike

Title: History shows colossal capex from AI giants like Amazon and Meta could lead to underperformance in their stock

Time Published: 2025-08-22T09:30:02Z

AI hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have invested billions in developing the technology and plan to spend even more — but history has a warning for their stock price. Tech giants are locked in an AI arms race, but their spending spree has potentially negative implications for their stock, a recent analysis from Morningstar shows. Data from the last 60 years shows stocks in the top 20% in capital expenditure relative to current sales have subsequently underformed relative to every other capex quintile. Philip Straehl, chief investment officer at Morningstar Wealth, told Business Insider this week that this is likely because the spending makes the technology more widely available, increasing competition for the big spenders. Higher capex "generally increases supply," Straehl said. "It's more difficult to monetize on those investments." Spending has been in the hundreds of billions of dollars so far for the four Big Tech firms mentioned above, and they're expected to spend $364 billion on AI development in 2025 alone. Since 2024, spending has started to cut into the free cash flow of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. Investors seem to be shrugging this off for now, but Straehl said the huge amounts of spending should start to matter down the line. "The core businesses of these companies are still doing well," he said. "But I think what's going to matter in the future is the ability to monetize generative AI." Bob Doll, the chief investment officer at Crossmarket Global Investments, told Business Insider that he agrees with Straehl's analysis. With the market highly valued amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, he's emphasizing the free cash flow factor in his portfolio. "Companies that substantially increase their capex usually lag for a while, until the capex is spent and you can start to see what's the return on that capex," Doll said. "So I share that concern." In terms of how Straehl is approaching this market, he said he's taking playing it safe with investor sentiment and market valuations historically high. "A core tenet of our investment philosophy is that the price paid for a given cash flow should be the primary driver of investment decisions," Straehl wrote in the August 19 analysis, adding: "We are once again reducing risk and are content to remain on the sidelines, awaiting more attractive opportunities."

Depopulation Blueprint Exposed â Globalists like Gates and WEF advance sterilization via toxic vaccines (COVID jabs, flu sprays), engineered water scarcity, lockdowns, and AI-driven unemploymentâaiming to reduce global population to 500 million. Decentralize or Die â Survival requires fleeing cities, securing off-grid water/food, and using independent AI tools (not centralized AI).

Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) isnât just a technological revolutionâitâs an existential threat to humanity, according to whistleblowers and experts warning of a systematic depopulation agenda. Former Google executive Mo Godot and others sound the alarm that governments and corporations are actively replacing human jobs with AIâbut with a sinister twist: no plans exist to retrain displaced workers because the endgame isnât adaptationâitâs extermination. As AI agents automate everything from graphic design and medicine to trucking and law, the ruling class views humanity as obsolete competition for dwindling resourcesâland, water, and electricityânow diverted to AI-powered data centers. The implications are terrifying: humans are being phased out. AI vs. Humans: The Ultimate Resource War AIâs exponential growth demands staggering amounts of electricity, water, and landâresources that humans also depend on. Data centers consume megawatts of power, vast tracts of farmland, and billions of gallons of waterâcompeting directly with human survival needs. China leads in AI dominance, with robotics already replacing factory labor and military personnel. Ukraine, crippled by war losses, now announces plans for ârobot armiesâ to replace decimated human troops. Amazon and tech giants automate warehouses, reducing humans to obsolete âskin-bag vending machines.â Yet, despite AI-driven job destruction, governments and corporations refuse to fund retraining programs. Why? Because their goal isnât to transition workersâitâs to eliminate them. The Hidden Depopulation Blueprint Whistleblowers like Mike Adams reveal that globalistsâincluding Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Big Pharmaâare accelerating a long-planned depopulation scheme using: Toxic Vaccines â COVID mRNA jabs and flu nasal sprays designed to induce infertility, turbo cancers, and suppress immunity. Engineered Water Scarcity â Aquifers drained for AI data centers while rural populations face forced relocation. Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.

Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.
