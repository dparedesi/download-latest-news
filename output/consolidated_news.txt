All the sales were in January and February when Meta’s stock was still trading above $US600, hitting a peak of more than $US736 on Valentine’s Day. The social-media company’s share price has since slid 32 per cent amid the broader market sell-off. Another top seller was Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive officer, who unloaded 3.8 million shares worth $US705 million before the tech giant’s stock fell more than 30 per cent. Those proceeds, combined with her remaining stake and investment portfolio, give her a fortune of $US2.4 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing her net worth for the first time. Dimon, CEO of the largest US bank, sold about $US234 million of stock during the quarter. He has a net worth of $US3 billion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

While technology stocks surged early in Trump’s presidency, the uncertainty over tariffs in the lead-up to April 2 – his so-called “Liberation Day” – helped prompt a sell-off that chopped trillions of dollars off global markets. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has seen his wealth tumble $US129 billion so far this year as uncertainty over tariffs, which could affect everything from phones to semiconductors, have hit tech industry stocks hard. Already, some billionaire insiders are using the opportunity to buy shares at depressed prices and increase their stakes. Insider selling overall was down compared with the first quarter of 2024, when 4702 insiders unloaded shares worth a total of $US28.1 billion, compared with $US15.5 billion from 3867 sellers this year, according to Washington Service.

This year’s first-quarter totals were more evenly distributed with 10 sellers unloading stock worth more than $US3.8 billion. Bloomberg The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Title: Weekly news roundup: Huawei accelerates, Nvidia reels, and TSMC anchors next wave of US chip reshoring

Credit: AFP These are the most-read DIGITIMES Asia stories from the week of April 14 – April 20. Huawei unveils new AI chip just one day after US bans Nvidia's H20 exports Just one day after the US banned exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China, Huawei launched its Ascend 920 on April 10. Slated for mass production in late 2025, the chip delivers over 900 TFLOPS, 4,000 GB/s bandwidth, and supports HBM3—offering a domestic alternative as China accelerates efforts to localize its AI compute infrastructure. Tariff maze deepens: US duties on Chinese goods up to 245% amid policy whiplash The Trump administration has issued nine tariff updates since January 2025—nearly equaling the previous two years combined—creating chaos for Chinese exporters. While devices like smartphones and laptops received temporary relief at 20%, tariffs on key tech exports now reach 245% for EVs, 195% for silicon wafers, and 70% for semiconductors. The layered tariffs, drawn from both Biden-era and Trump's ongoing retaliatory measures, create a convoluted regime with rates ranging from 20% to 245%, not including extra global duties on EVs, steel, and aluminum. TSMC hikes 4nm pricing; US clients scramble under tariff pressure Trump's tariff push has driven Apple, Nvidia, and AMD to increase orders at TSMC's Arizona fab, despite a 30% price hike tied to limited 4nm capacity. TSMC is now producing Nvidia's Blackwell chips and AMD's fifth-generation EPYC processors, with a 2nm "Venice" chip also taped out. Output is capped at 20,000–30,000 wafers per month, intensifying competition. Nvidia's US-based production, backed by Foxconn, Wistron, and Amkor, could total US$500 billion over four years. Analysts expect second-quarter revenue at TSMC to climb nearly 10%. Nvidia's China strategy set back by new US ban on H20 chip The US has imposed an indefinite export ban on Nvidia's H20 AI chip, citing risks of its use in Chinese supercomputers. Nvidia responded with a US$5.5 billion charge tied to inventory and commitments, sending its stock down 5% in after-hours trading. The restrictions also apply to AMD's MI308 chip and threaten key Chinese deals, including orders from Alibaba, delivering a major blow to Nvidia's China strategy. TSMC, Foxconn, and Wistron join Nvidia's US$500B push to manufacture AI chips and servers in the US Nvidia plans to produce up to US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over four years, aligning with Trump's push for domestic manufacturing. Production of Blackwell chips has begun at TSMC's 4nm fab in Arizona, while Foxconn and Wistron prepare to build AI servers in Texas. Amkor and SPIL will manage packaging, establishing the first end-to-end US-based AI chip supply chain. Nvidia is targeting cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, set to spend US$371 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, with its US-based gigawatt-scale chip buildout. Trump hailed the initiative as a flagship success of his "America First" industrial policy. AMD advances US chip strategy with TSMC, joining Nvidia in massive domestic shift During her April 15 visit to Taiwan, AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed that wafer production has started at TSMC's Arizona fab, with mass production of fifth-generation EPYC chips underway. AMD also unveiled its MI350 AI chip, built on TSMC's 3nm node with CDNA 4 and HBM3E, claiming 1.2x efficiency over Nvidia's B200. As tariffs reshape the tech supply chain, AMD joins Nvidia and Apple in expanding US-based production. TSMC projects second-quarter revenue growth of 5–9%, though demand may soften later due to frontloaded orders. Micron reportedly secures Nvidia certification for fifth-gen 12-layer HBM3E supply Micron has reportedly secured Nvidia's certification for its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E and will supply it for the Blackwell Ultra (GB300) AI chip. With mass production underway, Micron aims to lead HBM3E shipments by late 2025. Currently holding 5% of the HBM market—compared to SK Hynix's 53% and Samsung's 42%—Micron's entry into Nvidia's supply chain could reshape the competitive landscape. Article edited by Jack Wu

Title: Tesla's biggest fan on Wall Street says Elon Musk faces a 'Code Red Situation'

One of the biggest Tesla (TSLA) bulls on Wall Street says it’s time for Elon Musk to change the narrative about his EV maker. With Tesla set to report earnings on Tuesday after the ball amid slumping sales and a cratering stock, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Musk’s latest “turnaround vision” must begin with Musk’s earnings call. Ticking off the slew of setbacks Tesla has faced this year — from becoming “a political symbol” and brand damage to “protests and violence against Tesla dealerships” and new tariffs — Ives said “we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.” “So why stay bullish? It’s a great question,” Ives wrote in a Sunday note. “We believe Tesla along with Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years. The unparalleled innovation, engineering scale, autonomous roadmap, and robotics future will unleash massive valuation upside over the coming years in our view. From earlier this year: Elon Musk is distracted. Tesla stock is cratering. Some investors want a change But Ives also said it’s time for Musk to leave his position in the Trump administration leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Wedbush said Musk faces a “Code Red Situation” if he stays at DOGE. “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,” Ives said. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing... spend some time speaking to car buyers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.” “We view this as a fork in the road time,” Ives wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage... but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Wedbush still maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla stock. The shares were down more than 5% in Monday morning trading, and have fallen almost 40% so far this year. Tesla is no longer selling the majority of electric cars registered in America’s biggest electric vehicle market. The automaker has lost significant ground in California, which accounts for almost a third of all zero-emission purchases in the country According to a publication sponsored by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), Tesla’s share of the state’s EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter of this year from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla registrations in the first quarter of 2025 fell over 15% from a year earlier — while registrations for all other EVs increased by 35%. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign and transitioned into becoming a senior White House adviser after Trump’s inauguration. He now leads DOGE, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs and enact other spending cuts, and has frequently weighed in on foreign politics. Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Many peaceful demonstrations have taken place, including a slew of protests held on Sunday, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. But more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. —Shannon Carroll and William Gavin contributed to this article.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Bhavish Aggarwal is looking to raise up to $300 million for his artificial intelligence venture Ola Krutrim, curtailing his ambitions to snag about $500 million, after seeing poor investor appetite, three people aware of the development said. While there are no concrete investment offers on the table yet for the next round, Krutrim, led by its founder Bhavish Aggarwal, is “confident of bringing multiple big-ticket investors to the cap-table" in the coming months, these people said on the condition of anonymity. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and SBI Capital Markets are the bankers involved in the funding round, one of the persons cited earlier said, adding that Krutrim will raise funds in a mix of debt and equity. The three banks did not respond to Mint’s emailed requests for comment. An Ola spokesperson said the company “does not comment on speculations." Mint could not independently ascertain the valuation being sought by Aggarwal for the latest funding round from investors. Read more: NRAI contests exclusion from CCI confidentiality ring in Zomato antitrust probe Matrix Partners, which initially led Krutrim's first $50-million funding round, is said to be contributing $25 million more in the upcoming round, the second person said. “The company is speaking with a number of top venture capital funds outside of India for additional capital—basing their pitch upon developing indigenous infrastructure and artificial intelligence models. No deal has matured yet," they said. The third person added that the company’s $500-million funding push “was a part of Aggarwal’s effort to complete the $1 billion fundraise before his deadline. That didn’t exactly work out." Aggarwal announced in February that Krutrim will attract investments amounting to over $1 billion by 2026. Krutrim, unveiled on 15 December 2023, is Aggarwal’s moonshot AI project that has claimed it will build foundational models for Indic languages, as well as India’s own graphic processing unit (GPU) chip, to make its own data centres and AI ecosystem. Krutrim is sanskrit for the word 'artificial'. On the 42nd day after the announcement, Aggarwal claimed to have raised $50 million for Krutrim at a valuation of $1 billion. On 4 February this year, Aggarwal claimed to have invested $230 million in Krutrim. This came after Aggarwal pledged about 8% of his shareholding in publicly-listed Ola Electric to raise debt to finance Krutrim's expansion. The funding round could be a key part of Ola’s claim to “make India independent of depending on Western companies for AI," as per Aggarwal’s statement on 15 August 2024. However, the company is yet to showcase the efficacy and veracity of its work at scale—something that investors and sectoral consultants said could be difficult. Read more: For the first time, India to make most of a laptop in-house “Ola is yet to release any peer-reviewed journal on its AI development, or showcase any product implementation at scale to build any kind of investor confidence. There are also major concerns that AI ventures do not necessarily need large funds as the cost of computing reduces, and India focuses on AI applications. Venture capitalists are also cautious as AI continues to change in terms of its fundamental nature, every few weeks. None of this would favour Ola’s push for a massive funding round," said Jayanth Kolla, partner at technology consulting firm Convergence Catalyst. Brain drain at KrutrimMeanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development. A senior industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said that Krutrim “is yet to show why it needs sweeping funds to build any AI patent close to being comparable with OpenAI, Meta or Google." “In fact, at this moment, multiple executives including senior ones have left the core Krutrim engineering team that is led by Sambit Sahu," the industry executive said. When contacted directly, Sahu did not respond to Mint’s request for an interview. To make matters worse, India’s investors are not convinced about signing on large cheques to the scale of Aggarwal’s demand. “The investors that can offer such large amounts in funding are all based outside of India. But, the large VCs are focused on personalities who stand out with a world-leading pedigree of AI storytelling and product development. For Aggarwal, this is more difficult to pull off since his core competencies are not in AI," said Kashyap Kompella, AI consultant and chief executive of RPA2AI. Kolla said that relying on SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son—who has backed Ola before—may be out of the question “since Son is focused on pooling in his funds for the US’ Stargate AI initiative." Read more: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is making big bets, leaning heavily on borrowing Such a move could hurt Ola’s efforts to achieve its funding goal. Kompella added that the current macroeconomic environment “is not going to help either." “At this moment, Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are causing widespread uncertainties—with the markets fluctuating wildly. When there is business uncertainty, the first thing that is hit is dealmaking. Large funding efforts will thus be only concentrated around a few executives such as Mira Murati (of the OpenAI founding team), who stand out as veterans in the global AI industry, and smaller ventures without a clear-cut sector expertise may struggle to raise massive funding rounds," Kompella emphasized. The fundraising attempt from external investors comes at a time when Ola Electric is facing concerns over profitability and regulatory practices. Currently, it is facing questions from the Union ministry of road transport and highways and Ministry of Heavy Industries over the gap in its sales and registration numbers in the month of February. The government is also questioning the company's servicing capacity after thousands of consumer complaints emerged against its flagship electric scooters. Since debuting at the public markets in August last year at ₹76, its stock has lost more than 30%. From its peak, the share price has lost over 65% value in the past 9 months. On Thursday, Ola Electric's stock closed little changed at ₹50.24 on the BSE. (With Inputs from Sneha Shah) Meanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development.

70% third-party goods are sourced from China … Key Points Detailed Analysis Stock Performance Amazon’s stock has declined significantly in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a 27.03% drop from its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025 [MacroTrends]. Posts on X highlight a 5% dip linked to tariff concerns, with analysts slashing price targets due to uncertainty []. The tariffs exacerbate existing pressures like underperforming segments and slower AWS growth. Tariff Policy and Impact President Trump’s tariffs, escalated to 145% on Chinese imports (125% announced April 2025 + 20% fentanyl-related), target goods critical to Amazon’s e-commerce platform [][]. Morgan Stanley estimates 25% of Amazon’s first-party inventory costs and 71% of third-party sellers’ products originate from China, making Amazon highly exposed compared to peers [][]. The elimination of the de minimis exemption (effective May 2, 2025), which allowed tariff-free shipments under $800, further increases costs for low-value Chinese goods [][]. E-commerce Challenges Supply Chain Disruptions Amazon canceled some Chinese orders to limit tariff exposure, causing ripple effects for vendors [][]. Air freight congestion and potential customs delays (due to increased inspections post-de minimis) threaten stockouts, especially for Prime Day 2025 [][]. Sellers are exploring sourcing from Vietnam, India, or Mexico, but shifting supply chains is costly and slow [][]. Competitive Dynamics The tariffs level the playing field by raising costs for Chinese platforms like Temu and Shein, which relied on de minimis exemptions []. This could benefit Amazon’s U.S.-based sellers, but higher prices across platforms may dampen consumer demand, with some buyers already stockpiling goods []. Profit and Stock Outlook Despite e-commerce challenges, Amazon’s high-margin segments—AWS (13% YoY growth) and advertising ($17.3B in Q4 2024)—provide resilience. The Motley Fool argues tariffs won’t derail long-term profit growth, as e-commerce contributes only ~3% margins compared to 35% for ads/subscriptions []. This supports a bullish stock outlook, though short-term volatility persists due to tariff uncertainty. Table: Tariff Impact Summary Conclusion The 145% China tariffs significantly pressure Amazon’s e-commerce business, contributing to its 2025 stock decline through higher costs and supply chain disruptions. While Amazon mitigates impacts via strategic actions, price hikes or reduced sales loom. However, AWS and advertising profits bolster the stock’s long-term appeal, despite short-term tariff-driven volatility. Key Citations .

This decline aligns with the timing of President Trump’s tariff announcements in early April 2025, suggesting a link to tariff-related pressures. Tariff Impact on Business President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports, raised to 125% (or 145% including fentanyl-related measures), have increased costs for Amazon’s e-commerce operations.

Key Points Stock Performance Overview Amazon’s stock has faced a notable downturn in 2025, with a year-to-date loss of nearly 20% and a significant drop of 27.03% from its peak on February 4, 2025. This decline reflects broader challenges in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors, not unique to Amazon, but the company has seen recent gains evaporate. Analyst and Market Reactions Analyst actions, such as Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, may have contributed to the stock’s decline. This adjustment aligns with Wall Street’s “Strong Buy” consensus, but it suggests a cautious outlook that could affect investor sentiment. Business Segment Performance Certain business segments, particularly smart home devices, are lagging, potentially dragging down overall performance. While advertising revenue surged to $17.3 billion in Q4 2024, showing 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, this high-margin area hasn’t offset declines in other areas. Competitive Pressures Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing at 13% year-over-year, slower than competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud, risking market share loss before 2030. Additionally, increased competition in e-commerce post-COVID, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail, makes it harder for Amazon to achieve the high growth rates it once did, adding pressure on stock performance. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Amazon Stock Decline in 2025 Amazon’s stock has experienced a significant decline in 2025, with multiple factors contributing to its performance as of April 19, 2025. This analysis delves into the detailed reasons behind the downturn, drawing from recent financial reports and market analyses to provide a comprehensive overview. Stock Performance Metrics The stock has seen a year-to-date loss of nearly 20%, a stark contrast to its performance earlier in the year. From its all-time high of $242.52 on February 4, 2025, it has dropped by 27.03%, closing at $172.63 on April 17, 2025, according to historical data from MacroTrends Amazon – 28 Year Stock Price History | AMZN | MacroTrends. This decline aligns with forecasts from Long Forecast, which predicted a -14.1% change for April 2025, with the stock closing at $165 from an opening of $192 AMAZON STOCK PRICE PREDICTION 2025, 2026, 2027-2029 – Long Forecast. Analyst Sentiment and Price Target Adjustments Analyst sentiment has played a role, with Jefferies lowering its price target from $275 to $250 in early April 2025, as noted in a report from 24/7 Wall St. Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Despite maintaining a “Buy” rating, this adjustment reflects a cautious outlook, potentially impacting investor confidence and contributing to the stock’s decline. Business Segment Performance Specific business segments have underperformed, notably smart home devices, which are lagging behind expectations. This segment’s struggles are highlighted in the 24/7 Wall St. report, suggesting it drags on overall company performance. Conversely, advertising revenue showed strength, reaching $17.3 billion in Q4 2024 with 18% quarter-over-quarter growth, but this hasn’t been sufficient to offset declines in other areas Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. Competitive Landscape and Growth Challenges Amazon Web Services (AWS), a key revenue driver, is growing at 13% year-over-year, which is slower compared to competitors like Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud. This slower growth rate poses a risk of market share loss before 2030, as detailed in the 24/7 Wall St. analysis Amazon Stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 for April 16. In e-commerce, increased competition post-COVID has made growth more challenging, with online sales only accounting for 15% of retail sales, making it harder to achieve the high growth rates seen a decade ago, further pressuring the stock. Market Context and Broader Trends The decline isn’t isolated to Amazon; it’s part of a broader tumult affecting tech and consumer discretionary stocks in 2025, as noted in the 24/7 Wall St. report. This context suggests macroeconomic factors and sector-wide challenges are also at play, though Amazon’s specific business issues amplify the impact.

Title: Working to de-power China’s smart battery dominance

Time Published: 2025-04-20T18:41:22Z

By Andrew King, Real Clear Wire April 20, 2025 America remains perilously unaware as it approaches a catastrophic ambush—a savvy, ruthless strategy designed to eliminate credible competition in the critical energy and rare earth domain. Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL) is aggressively orchestrating a $5 billion+ initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. Bolstered by powerful global financial syndicate, which includes Bank of America and JPMorgan, CATL is deliberately targeting the most influential, global investors, including America’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, Prudential, State Street, and Vanguard. While Wall Street leaders claim prudent stewardship, Bank of America and JPMorgan are headlining the bookrunning of the offering for CATL—a Chinese company explicitly 1260H-listed by the Pentagon calling attention to their direct ties to China’s military-industrial complex—expected to be the largest Hong Kong listing since at least 2021. This isn’t merely bad optics; it’s strategic sabotage, endangering America’s national security. Make no mistake: CATL is not just a battery company—it’s central to China’s global ambitions. With a dominant 38% share of the global electric vehicle battery market, supplying giants like Tesla, BMW, Ford, and Volkswagen, CATL anchors Beijing’s bid to dominate strategic technologies. At January’s World Economic Forum at Davos, CATL co-chair Pan Jian boasted of a new class of electric vehicles (EVs), “Electric Intelligent Vehicles” (EIVs)—cars equipped with CCP-backed surveillance technology, converting everyday vehicles into mobile intelligence assets to be dispersed across the globe. This is not speculation—it follows the CCP’s proven playbook, replicating Huawei’s telecom networks, ZPMC’s ship-to-shore, Port-based cranes, and TikTok’s data harvesting models. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Let this sink in: Bank of America—the very namesake of our nation—is actively providing financial and reputational cover for a firm that functions as a de facto extension of China’s military. A bank accused of systematically discriminating against American conservative and faith-based groups by fourteen state attorney generals and President Trump, who publicly excoriated CEO Brian Moynihan for politically motivated “debanking” of citizens at home, is actively facilitating China’s global ambitions abroad. CATL represents a danger well beyond TikTok’s near-term data-harvesting concerns. While TikTok represents a near-term threat, it is in an industry notable for the fickleness of customers and rapid pace emergent platforms supplant laggards, while energy, battery and transportation technologies are deeply embedded in infrastructure with useful lives spanning decades. In fact, these strengths are so decisive that Beijing has structured its global ambitions on EV batteries, solar panels, and electric vehicles as cornerstones of its Belt and Road Initiative. According to the Rhodium Group, these same three segments accounted for 77% of Chinese foreign direct investment in 2024—of which, two of the three CATL is a leader—underscoring CATL’s central role as a strategic asset in Beijing’s goals of global dominance. Yet beneath CATL’s EV battery veneer lies a deeper, more sinister strategic geopolitical calculus: reinforcing China’s near-total monopoly over rare earth minerals and critical materials that power nearly all semiconductor and advanced technologies. “China accounts for approximately 69% of global rare earth ore production and processes about 90% of rare earth minerals globally,” according to Polytechnique Insights. Make no mistake, CATL’s true geopolitical threat is not simply batteries; CATL is poised to be a rare earth mineral juggernaut. This is not a battery fight, it is a rare earth mineral war. China controls 90% of permanent magnet manufacturing, it refines 98% of the world’s gallium, produces 99% of its terbium, and dominates 85% of global battery production. These are not abstract numbers—they represent a strategic chokehold on the materials that power commercial electronic guidance systems, electric vehicles, semiconductors, and next-generation energy solutions. And every piece of military hardware and advanced technology relies on these minerals, just as China restricted exports of the vast majority of such elements, publicly revealing a pillar of their economic statecraft strategy decades in the making. In an era of electronics, control of rare earth and critical minerals is the kingmaker. The threat is most clearly displayed by a simple categorical listing of the most critical minerals: For critical minerals like Neodymium (precision-guided missiles), Gallium (semiconductors), Terbium (sonar), and Graphene (advanced sensors), China’s dominance approaches absolute—between 95% and 99%. As illustrated, reconstituting American capacity would require billions of dollars for each mineral and, for the vast majority of minerals, five to ten years to reconstitute a competitive balance—with some rare minerals having estimates of a decade and a half, time the U.S. simply does not have.[1] These minerals underpin every advanced American weapons system, from F-35 fighters and submarines to guided missiles and drones. Wall Street’s underwriting of CATL’s IPO further cements China’s chokehold, allowing Beijing to weaponize American dependency. China has spent decades infiltrating American artificial intelligence labs, quantum computing firms, and advanced materials research centers—stealing $400-600 billion annually in intellectual property (IP). CATL’s IPO prospectus claims 40,000 filed and secured patents, dubious marketing already being debunked, evincing a more surreptitious, deeper question of the strategic use of China’s patent office in strategic IP warfare undermining and chilling the global trademark and patent field. Together with IP theft and forced coercion of companies, the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) perpetuates the charade of China as a “developing country,” a designation that permits favorable exemptions, waivers, and concessions benefiting China. As the think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) notes, “China’s state-supported technology champions frequently benefit from stolen or unfairly appropriated intellectual property, directly undermining U.S. innovation.” By underwriting CATL’s IPO, Wall Street is indirectly legitimizing the industrial-scale theft of U.S. intellectual property and ruse of accountability under the WTO. Perhaps even more reprehensible, this IPO directly benefits the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing routinely employs a tactic known as the “Golden Share”—where a small government stake (often just 1%) grants the CCP outsized control over corporate decision-making. And with more than 12% ownership through state-owned entities, this IPO will massively inflate the value of their holdings, handing Beijing billions in fresh capital to fuel its military and industrial ambitions. Control of rare earth and critical minerals is the decisive geopolitical lever and CATL is the vehicle of China’s broad ambitions which, as Chairman Jian noted, CATL has found a way to combine a range of rare earth-based technologies into EIV consumer sales. The Select Committee on the CCP further highlights ethical concerns, noting CATL’s supply chain has “indisputable evidence” of ties to forced labor in Xinjiang. This IPO will enable CATL to penetrate European markets aggressively (Germany, Hungary, Spain), undermining American competitiveness and solidifying China’s global technological hegemony. It also provides a convenient loophole for U.S. investors who, due to restrictive mandates, may not be able to directly invest in mainland China but have greater discretion to channel funding through the Hong Kong market. This IPO represents a strategic catastrophe. It enables China’s geopolitical ascent, legitimizes corporate espionage, and compromises America’s technological edge. By backing CATL’s IPO, Bank of America and JPMorgan implicitly legitimize industrial-scale IP theft, rewarding China’s illicit behavior and empowering Beijing at America’s expense. America’s banks must renounce their roles in any fundraising by CATL. This moment demands clarity and leadership from both the private and public sectors. Financial institutions must: Government agencies must: The stakes could not be clearer. Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan, who already faces a legacy most notable for excessive caution and lagging shareholder performance, is poised to be inextricably linked to overseeing a collaboration with America’s avowed enemy, further tarnishing an iconic banking brand. Mr. Moynihan faces a decisive moment, one that will define not only his leadership and Bank of America’s legacy but also America’s role in the world. The banks’ actions will have far-reaching consequences, not just for the banks’ shareholders, but for every American who still believes in the values of freedom, security, and sovereignty. Investment banks, especially Bank of America, must choose. Do these banks serve America’s long-term prosperity, or merely eager, unprincipled mercenaries acting as accomplices in China’s strategic campaign to supplant our nation? America deserves—and demands—an answer.

Title: Hertz Stock Up 131% On Ackman’s Iffy Bet Tariffs To Boost Car Value

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI American actor Peter Falk at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, 1982. (Photo by ... More Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images) Many investors have bet against car rental company Hertz Global. But activist investor Bill Ackman has built a 19.8% stake in the company, according to an April 16 Pershing Square Capital regulatory filing, the Globe and Mail reported. Since April 15, Hertz stock – about 40% of the company’s shares are sold short, according to the Wall Street Journal – have surged 131%. Is now a great time to buy Hertz stock? Here are four reasons to steer clear of these shares: Hertz is pleased with Ackman’s investment. “I am humbled, and we should all feel encouraged by Bill Ackman’s comments and energized by the strong support shown by him,” Hertz CEO Gil West said in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters. Ackman warned investors to be wary of the stock even as he argued Hertz – which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and now has two business lines: renting vehicles and borrowing heavily to own vehicles -- is undervalued, noted the Globe And Mail. I requested a comment from Hertz and will update this post if I receive a response. On social media, Ackman – who has a large following among individual investors and owns a big stake in Uber – gave three reasons why shares of Hertz could be worth $30 per share by 2029, the Globe And Mail reported. These include the following: While Ackman is right about the industry structure being concentrated, his numbers appear high. Rather than 95% of the market, their combined market share is 83% – Enterprise (39%), Hertz (22%), and Avis/Budget (22%), according to Market.us. Also, I question how successful Hertz’s turnaround is and whether tariffs and the Uber/Hertz partnership will boost Hertz’s value. After hosting a revolving door of CEOs, Hertz has recently contracted unprofitably. Hertz entered bankruptcy in May 2020 and emerged on July 1, 2021, under Paul Stone’s leadership – "returning about $8 a share to stockholders in its exit from chapter 11," noted the Journal. Mark Fields, who served as interim CEO from October 5, 2021, made the decision for Hertz to order 100,000 Teslas. Despite TV ads from Tom Brady promoting the Tesla fleet, consumers did not take the bait, the Journal reported. Hertz’s operating costs rose and in February 2022 Fields was replaced by Goldman Sachs veteran Stephen Scherr who built up the EV fleet. In December 2022, Hertz took a "$168 million charge to settle 364 claims related to the company falsely reporting rental cars as stolen," according to CNN. On April 1, 2024, West – who was previously Delta Airlines chief operating officer -- replaced Scherr as CEO. West cut operating costs by selling a large portion of Hertz’s EV fleet and the associated remote charging network – taking a $200 million writedown, the Journal wrote. The EV blunder reduced Hertz’s earnings, and the company has reported net losses for the last couple of years – including quarterly losses for the most recent five quarters ending December 2024. Moreover, during that time the rental car company’s debt load has increased 6% to $18.3 billion, its equity has plunged 95% to $153 million, and its revenue fell 6% to about $2 billion in the final quarter of 2024, noted the Journal. Ackman sees tariffs boosting the value of Hertz’s fleet of used late-model vehicles. He als0 expects a partnership with Uber to increase the companies’ fleet utilization and profitability. He forecasts President Donald Trump’s 25% levy on imported automobiles will boost the value of Hertz’s 500,000 vehicles by 10% – increasing their value to $13.2 billion. Moreover, the “$1.2 billion gain on its auto assets is equivalent to approximately half of the company’s current market capitalization,” Ackman said in an X post featured by Bloomberg. Ackman’s 10% is at the high end of a range of used car price increase estimates. For example, one analyst expects used car prices to rise between a 5% and 10% in the near future, according to iSeeCars. Of course if that happens, I doubt Ackman expects Hertz to sell all 500,000 of those vehicles. So, as the company replaces older vehicles with new ones subject to tariffs, it is unclear how much of that $1.2 billion value increase the company will capture. Ackman is counting on West to boost Hertz’s stock price. Getting there would require the company to reach the CEO’s operating targets which include $1,500 in revenue per unit, around $30-per-vehicle operating expense, about $300 in depreciation per unit, and an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, Ackman noted on X. Ackman also floated the idea of Hertz managing a fleet of self-driving vehicles – in its 11,200 global locations – for Uber which is “excited to brainstorm on how we can expand on our relationship,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi posted on X. I question the realism of West’s operating targets. Many economists see tariffs causing an economic slowdown. If that happens, consumers and businesses could cut back on travel – thus lowering Hertz’s revenue per unit. Moreover, with tariffs raising the price of auto parts, vehicle operating expenses could go up rather than fall. Hertz faces other threats – notably a $272 million legal judgment from bondholders who claim the company should have paid them interest during its time in chapter 11. Hertz is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court. “While the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resumption of global travel rendered Hertz solvent despite the high stakes of this dispute, the nearly $272 million at issue here could make the difference between solvency and insolvency in many cases,” Hertz lawyers wrote in an April 4 petition to the high court featured in a Bloomberg report. Bondholders remain wary of Hertz’s junior bonds. They still trade “around 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,” the Journal reported. Hertz shares are way overvalued in the view of Wall Street. Four analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $2.93 – suggesting the rental car company stock is 181% over-valued. Short sellers may have contributed to this overvaluation by scrambling to repay the shares they borrowed – assuming some of them purchased the stock in a rising market following Ackman’s announcement of his 19.8% stake. I agree with Ackman’s concluding thoughts. “Investing is risky,” he wrote on X. “There are no guarantees of a successful outcome. Caveat emptor.” Consider avoiding Hertz stock.

Pedigree counts. Clontarf and Cork Constitution set up a heavyweight Energia All-Ireland League final next Sunday in the second leg of an Aviva Stadium double with the women’s final after taut, tight, hard-earned semi-final wins over Lansdowne and St Mary’s respectively. Clontarf, the 2022 champions, will thus meet the reigning champions Con in a Leinster-Munster affair. It was always unlikely that the Clontarf-Lansdowne semi-final would scale the heights of the former’s astonishing 49-46 win between the sides at Castle Avenue, which had been played on the club’s all-weather pitch. Aside from the heightened stakes, the heavy rain of the previous 24 hours or so had left the pitch gluey. That said, it was a lively start. The Lansdowne backs had the better individual flair and strike plays, as evidenced by the move from deep which eventually led to outhalf Stephen Madigan cross-kicking perfectly for lock Ruairí Clarke to score. Clontarf began to find more traction and Ben Griffin burst through the Lansdowne defence from Conor Kelly’s pass for scrumhalf Sam Owens to finish. Kelly converted, but his pass was then picked off by Charlie Tector who scored from halfway and added the conversion. But Kelly and ‘Tarf are tough competitors, and after he exchanged penalties with Tector, Clontarf opted for the corner with the last play of the first half for a trademark power play and a try by Griffin which Kelly converted for a 15-13 interval lead. Though scoreless, the second period ebbed consistently. The margins remained tiny and the noise levels ratcheted up before Aaron Coleman won the game’s final penalty to huge home celebrations. Con will be seeking to become the first club to win back-to-back AIL titles since Shannon in 2006 after a 16-8 arm wrestle over newly promoted St Mary’s on an even heavier pitch at Templeville Road. The home side went ahead through a blindside try off a maul by flanker Ethan Baxter but Con availed of successive yellow cards for the influential St Mary’s duo of captain Ronan Waters and fullback Conor Hayes either side of the interval. First James Taylor landed a penalty and then scrumhalf Adam Maher set up captain David Hyland for a try, which Taylor converted. Taylor extended the lead before Hayes trimmed it again. But after Mary’s went to the corner with one penalty to be repelled, Hayes then missed another before Taylor sealed the deal. The promotion/relegation semi-finals featured four wins by just one or two points. Nenagh have moved to within one match of becoming the first Tipperary club in the top flight after a 25-17 win over Blackrock to set up a promotion decider next Saturday at New Ormond Park against UCC, for whom first-half tries by centres by Daniel Squires and Irish Under-20 midfielder Gene O’Leary Kareem helped earn the day’s only other away win to relegate City of Armagh. Trinity earned themselves a Division 1B lifeline with a nerve-jangling 20-18 win over Greystones to earn a promotion/relegation decider against Cashel, relatively comfortable 26-14 winners over Barnhall. Similarly, Navan will seek to avoid relegation in their centenary year after their 29-19 win over Galwegians earned a decider at home to Dungannon, for whom Ben McCaughey’s penalty with the last kick earned a 23-22 win over local rivals Clogher Valley. In the 2B promotion playoff, Skerries’ 27-18 semi-final win over Ballyclare has earned them a decider against Midleton, who beat Dolphin 18-17 in their all-Cork semi-final. Division 1A semi-finals: St Mary’s Col 8 Cork Con 16; Clontarf 17 Lansdowne 15. Division 1A promotion playoff semi-finals: City of Armagh 10 UCC 17; Nenagh Ormond 25 Blackrock College 17. Division 1B promotion playoff semi-finals: Cashel RFC 26 MU Barnhall 14; Dublin University 20 Greystones 18. Division 2A promotion playoff semi-finals: Dungannon 23 Clogher Valley 22; Navan 29 Galwegians 19. Division 2B promotion playoff semi-finals: Midleton 18 Dolphin 17; Skerries 27 Ballyclare 10.

Title: 5 Must-Haves In Your Morning Routine Guarantee Career Success

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. No matter how you start your early morning routines, if you want to be productive and successful, ... More career experts say you should include these five things. A recent TikTok video by @ashtonhallofficial went viral amassing a staggering 109.2 million views. The video showed the creator’s time-stamped morning routine, starting as early as three a.m. The video gained traction as viewers wonder how realistic the routine is for success. After seeing the video, career experts at resume.io decided to offer tips on how five must-haves in your morning routine guarantee career success and boost productivity throughout your workday. On some days, given the daily obstacles many of us face in our jobs, it can feel more productive to hit the alarm, roll over and go back to sleep--especially with threats of inflation, AI competition and massive layoffs. But then reality hits, reminding you that you have to future-proof your job so you don’t end up another statistic. But have you ever been curious about how the rich and famous, with less to lose, start their early mornings? The career experts at resume.io compiled the morning routines of successful CEO billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook to show they start their morning routines for continued successful workdays. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and worth $202 billion, awakens around 6:30 a.m., according to resume.io and enjoys a screen-free start to his workday. The career experts describe his mornings as slow with family breakfasts and journaling before bracing the workday. They conclude that Bezos’ slow and balanced morning routine proves that productivity doesn’t always require rushing. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is worth $188.1 billion. Career experts tell us that he starts his day at eight a.m., checking numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. “Zuckerberg is known for his minimalistic morning routine, including wearing the same style of outfit daily to avoid decision fatigue,” they note. “This habit is also synonymous with other successful people like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, worth $2.4 billion, is one of the earliest risers in the business world, according to the career experts. He starts his day between 3:45 a.m. “This may be what inspired TikTok creator @ashtonhallofficial to do the same,” the experts speculate. “Cook uses the early hours to get ahead on emails and current affairs. He also often completes a workout before 6 a.m. Cook credits his structured early starts with helping him stay focused throughout the workday.” You may have already realized that the difference in you and the billionaires is that they have the freedom of going to bed and getting up when they choose. Many of us in the workforce don’t have the luxury of when to hit the hay or awaken in the morning. But research informs us that routines and rituals help with self-regulation and job stress, contributing to productivity and career success. So, it’s important to consider a structured morning to get your workday off on the right foot. Amanda Augustine, career expert for resume.io, explains that you don’t need to wake up at 3 a.m. to be successful. She advises that the key to having a productive morning depends on three factors: consistency, balance and starting the day off on your own terms. Here are Augustine’s habits that can be integrated into a morning routine that guarantees career success. 1. Aim to wake up at a consistent time. “Try waking up around the same time each day to help regulate your body’s natural rhythm,” Augustine suggests. “Over time, your body will learn when it’s time to be alert, helping you avoid grogginess and feel more energized in the morning.” 2. Limit phone use for the first 30-60 minutes. “Resist the urge to jump into emails or scroll through social media—even if it’s what some famous CEOs swear by,” she advises. “Giving yourself some screen-free time in the morning can lower stress levels and help you start your day calmly and with intention, rather than reacting to the noise around you.” 3. Soak in some natural light. Augustine recommends exposing yourself to natural light within the first hour of waking up. “Whether it’s stepping outside or opening the blinds, this simple habit helps reset your internal clock, lifts your mood and supports better sleep at night.” 4. Move your body. “Incorporating movement into your morning—whether it’s stretching, walking or a quick workout—can get your blood flowing, improve your focus, and boost your mood for the rest of the day,” she points out. 5. Set your intentions for the day. “Take a few minutes each morning to jot down your top one-to-three priorities for the day.” According to Augustine, this helps bring clarity to your morning and ensures you’re starting with purpose instead of just jumping into the next thing. "Remember, the key is to build a morning routine that suits your lifestyle. This will make it easier to maintain and more effective in setting you up for long-term success,” she concludes. These five must-haves in your morning routine corroborate studies that show morning contemplation broadens your perspective and reverses negative thoughts such as self-doubt and uncertainty about the future. Whatever you plant in your mind in the early morning will continue to live and breathe within as you face the challenges in the workdays ahead.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Shaken by geopolitical shocks, the S&P 500 was flat last week and the Nasdaq nosed just into the red — but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished significantly lower, weighed down by a double blow from UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). UnitedHealth slashed its full-year forecast after a rough quarter, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping nearly 7% after reports of a new U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. It wasn’t all red arrows. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman revealed a sizable stake in the rental car firm — a bullish bet on a company still recovering from post-pandemic headwinds. Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped after announcing that its experimental weight-loss pill cleared a key late-stage trial, strengthening its position in the lucrative obesity drug market. Investors now look ahead to a packed week of earnings and economic data, with Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), AbbVie (ABBV+2.71%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) all set to report — alongside key releases on PMI, jobless claims, and the Fed’s closely watched Beige Book. Tesla’s results are set to kick things off Tuesday, and the company’s earnings will be one of the most closely watched reports of the week, with signs pointing to a potential tough quarter. Vehicle registrations in California — Tesla’s largest U.S. market — fell more than 15% year-over-year, marking a sixth straight quarterly decline. The company’s share of the state’s EV market also dropped sharply amid growing competition, an aging product lineup, and the controversial public image of CEO Elon Musk. Also on deck: SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Novartis (NVS+1.90%), two European heavyweights that will test investor confidence in multinationals navigating weak demand and shifting interest rate policy. GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) offers a read on global defense and aviation spending, while Verizon’s (VZ+1.98%) results could reveal whether telecom providers are holding the line on customer growth and capital costs. Other names to watch include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%) and Danaher (DHR+2.50%), which will offer clues on whether momentum in medical technology is holding up. Chubb (CB+2.17%) and Lockheed Martin round out the day, with updates from the insurance and defense sectors — both of which tend to attract investors during periods of economic uncertainty. IBM (IBM+1.52%) and AT&T (T+1.94%) will be in focus as bellwethers for enterprise tech and telecom — sectors that have promised stability but face rising pressure to cut costs and defend margins. Boeing also reports, with investors watching for updates on aircraft deliveries and production pace. The company now faces a fresh geopolitical headwind: reports that China has asked its airlines to halt Boeing orders, thrusting the U.S. aerospace giant into the center of escalating trade tensions. While the move won’t impact this quarter’s results, it raises new questions about the strength of Boeing’s international order book and the outlook for global demand. Markets will also be parsing April’s flash PMI data on Wednesday — key readings on both the services and manufacturing sectors, which may reveal whether the economy is cooling fast enough for the Fed’s comfort. Later that day, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book lands. Published eight times a year, the Beige Book compiles anecdotal reports from businesses across the country, offering a ground-level look at wage pressures, hiring, and consumer demand. It’s less about hard numbers and more about vibes. Alphabet will report earnings under the shadow of a major legal setback. A U.S. federal judge just ruled that the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google’s ad tech business can proceed, rejecting the company’s effort to have it thrown out. The lawsuit, which could ultimately force a breakup of Google’s advertising operations, adds a layer of uncertainty to a business already under pressure. While investors are hoping to see continued AI progress and cost control, shares remain down about 20% this year. Procter & Gamble, Merck (MRK+0.18%), T-Mobile (TMUS+2.22%), and PepsiCo (PEP+1.84%) all report Thursday, too, offering a cross-sector pulse check on consumer spending, pricing power, and healthcare demand. Also reporting: Union Pacific (UNP+1.88%), Gilead (GILD+2.77%), and Comcast (CMCSA+1.99%), bringing updates on freight volumes, drug pipelines, and broadband subscriber trends. You can also expect fresh signals on the health of the labor market and business spending, with jobless claims and durable goods orders both hitting at 8:30 a.m. ET. The numbers could either bolster hopes for rate cuts or cement the Fed’s cautious stance. It’s a fitting end to a high-stakes week: earnings from Charter (CHTR+2.18%), Aon (AON+2.74%), and HCA (HCA+2.17%) will spotlight momentum in media, insurance, and healthcare, while AbbVie, Colgate (CL+1.22%), and a cross-section of energy and services firms round out the picture. Together, they’ll offer a final read on how Q1 really landed — and set the tone for what’s next. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date.

Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy.

Title: Letters: Your correspondents enliven the day with humour and controversy
URL: https://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/letters-your-correspondents-enliven-the-day-with-humour-and-controversy/a356403231.html

Full Content:
Tom Gilsenan Terry Healy JF Sir — It was great to see last week’s Sunday Independent acknowledging some of the people who for years have been regular writers to your Letters page (‘Dear Sir’, People & Culture). These familiar names, the correspondents who have provided us with lots of entertainment, debate and sometimes controversy on a wide range of topics. This is what makes your Letters page such unmissable reading, and for me often the most interesting page. It was so nice to hear your letter writers’ motivation and interests and put a face to these talented people. I have to commend the way your paper never flinches from publishing letters from readers criticising articles in previous editions. Brian Lube, Co Meath Sir — I thoroughly enjoyed the letter writers article. It was wonderful to finally put faces to the names of those prolific writers. The fourth wall has been broken and has revealed an ageing demographic, one whose connection to the written word is more deeply ingrained then those who might come after them. Such a striking revelation is not to be taken lightly — it is a reflection of the times, and the printed page is showing its age. We live in a TikTok generation where the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Although this future is uncertain, my hope is that the art of letter writing will endure, and tangible, well-crafted thoughts and opinions will prevail — that these words, written by anyone, will continue to be addressed to everyone. Elliot McCarthy, The Tower, Cork Sir — Your piece profiling 10 regular contributors to the Letters page was illuminating. It’s nice to put faces to so many familiar names, including a few that I’ve had the pleasure of sparring with over the years. However, readers of the article would be forgiven for thinking letter writing is the preserve of those enjoying or approaching retirement. On the contrary, some of us are 30 and younger, have 15 years’ worth of published letters under our belts and entertain hopes there are many more to come. Letter writing as a pastime and a therapy has multi-generational appeal. Killian Foley-Walsh, Kilkenny city Sir — Ah, stop the lights. I’ve just opened my Sunday Indo and there he is in the flesh, none other than the mysterious Tom Gilsenan. The number of times I have asked myself, “Who the hell is this Tom Gilsenan constantly getting published?”, before eventually concluding he was actually a journalist in disguise — possibly far more talented and interesting, I might add. Keep them coming, Tom, now I know you are not some kind of bot masquerading as a human. Seriously, you generally hit the nail on the head. Well done you, and fair play to Roslyn Dee, whom I adore as a columnist. Breeda Geraghty, Shrule, Co Mayo Sir — Roslyn Dee’s piece was fascinating. In the St Petersburg Times in 1951, PG Wodehouse wrote: “I yearn to write letters to the papers. All authors do. Novelists are merely those who have failed as contributors to the Correspondence Column. Unable to make the grade, they drop down a rung on the ladder and write novels.” Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin Sir — I’m not entirely sure how I feel about seeing the faces of fellow letter writers to national newspapers. A bit like Bansky, the pseudo­nymous street artist, not really knowing who is behind the art is part of the fascination of seeing letters appear in print — at least for me. Nevertheless, I have to take my hat off to the witticisms of Tom Gilsenan, who clearly is a fan of Beckett — less is more. And to Mary Stewart from Donegal, whose political views would differ from mine. She once had a go at me in print for criticising something David Quinn wrote — called me a “Lumiere”. As a lover of the big screen, I viewed that as a compliment of the highest order. Thank you, Mary! Finally, to the editor, who put Tournageehy firmly on the map. My father would be proud. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Listowel, Co Kerry Sir — I was delighted to see letter writers being recognised and written about. I was once referred to as “your prolific letter writer”. My prolific days ended, as happenings in life began to take a toll, but I am now hopeful of attempting to continue the joy of writing letters to the editor, starting with this particular one, be it published or not. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Sir — Thanks a million for featuring the brilliant letter writers. It was great to see the faces with the names. While I loved the piece by Roslyn Dee about me, I did not recognise myself in the photo. So I’m sending you one of myself taken four weeks ago. Perhaps you could print it with this letter? (See above). Terry Healy Riordan, Kill, Co Kildare Sir — Sarah Caden’s very ­welcome interview with Helen Joyce (People & Culture, April 13) could not have been more timely, coming as it did on the same day we learnt a legal action seeking a judicial review of the State’s treatment of children with gender identity issues is due to come before the High Court. Helen Joyce had a significant career in maths and journalism, but took up the task of challenging gender identity ideology and its ramifications. She is one of the most prominent figures called on to speak in defence of the rights of women and the need to safeguard the interests of children from being misled by activists and others in authority. There is no room for compla­cency here either, and the ­Government needs to educate ­itself about the risks of promoting this ideology. The fallout from this is ­already being seen in other countries, with a growing number of adults now realising they have been harmed irreversibly through the use of hormones and possibly surgery when they were younger. Further risk to Irish children might be avoided if those in positions of authority in the HSE, teaching and ­politics heed the warnings by Helen Joyce and others of the dangers posed by this ideology, which has led to this medical scandal. Thank you for bringing attention to the work of this tremendous woman, one whom we can be proud to call our own. Jill Nesbitt, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was engaging, but for me what was surprising was your statement that “no Irish media outlet had interviewed the bestselling [Irish] author”. Why not? The UK Supreme Court has just ruled that a woman is someone born at birth as biologically ­female. It has been described as a “commonsense decision”. Yet the Irish political class cannot tell us what a woman is. Their verbal somersaults are at best amusing, especially in light of the Cass Report. It is almost a year since Jacky Grainger (Sunday Independent interview, May 4, 2024) beseeched the political class to find the “courage and integrity” to slay the gender ideology gripping the state and put children’s health and lives at the forefront of policy. Sadly, the gender ideological tectonic plates have not yet moved. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was a delight: Joyce has been effectively cancelled by the Irish media for so long because of her rational and sensible views on the trans issue. Hopefully, now you have broken the spell, we may see and hear more from Joyce and others who support women’s rights. Similarly, RTÉ might now have the courage to interview other gender-critical writers and activists, rather than the one-­sided propaganda that has been pushed unopposed for so long. Julia Anderson, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — I was delighted that you finally interviewed Helen Joyce. She eloquently expresses views of the majority of people — that humans can’t change sex; that women and girls deserve single sex spaces, services and sports; that gender non-conforming children are not born in the wrong body and don’t need to be medically and surgically ‘fixed’; and that forcing lesbians to accept men who identify as women into their dating pool is modern-day gay conversion therapy. Unless our politicians and organisations recognise this, we are facing further dismantling of women’s and gay rights and of child safeguarding. Elena Brooks, Glenageary, Co Dublin Sir — Helen Joyce is a mathematician. As such, she reduces and separates humanity to a ­binary — men and women. She is no authority on trans people, nor on gender issues, as evidenced by the ruling of an Australian judge who said in a recent case that “she is not an expert at all. She has no recognised expertise in any of the areas in which she expresses an opinion”. Joyce tells us she knows trans people, but she has books to sell, so she has commoditised trans people’s lives. As mammies, we know that people, including trans people, cannot be reduced to numerical equations, to one or zero. Humanity is not binary. We, the mammies, know a lot of trans people, some since the day they were born. We hold their hands when they are scared, happy, ­upset, joyful. We have heard their hopes, their dreams, and dried their tears. We listen to trans people. Helen Joyce does not. We have no books to sell; just love to give. Love always wins. Jude Copeland, Bernie ­Linnane, Claire Flynn, Karen Sugrue, Mammies for Trans Rights Sir — I want to sincerely thank you for publishing your powerful and honest interview with Helen Joyce. She’s one of the few people brave enough to speak clearly and compassionately about a subject most are too afraid to touch. It is no accident that RTÉ and other media outlets refuse to interview her. They know if ­Helen is given the chance to speak plainly, their ideology cannot withstand it. They cannot ­explain why they are endorsing the sterilisation of vulnerable children in the name of identity — so instead, they silence people like Helen and smear them as unkind or extreme. But we see through it. I know I’m not alone. I’ve had countless hushed conversations with friends, neighbours and colleagues who agree with everything Helen says, but who are terrified to say so out loud. We need to be braver. The truth cannot survive if we whisper it behind closed doors. Sarah Holmes, Newcastle, Co Wicklow Sir — Your interview with ­Helen Joyce was a courageous piece that gave voice to opinions that are forbidden in most quarters of the Irish media. Dr Joyce’s remark that it is “wicked” to lie to parents by telling them their children are at increased risk of suicide if they are not “affirmed” in the belief that they were born in the wrong body deserves serious reflection. Every journalist, politician, doctor, teacher and psychotherapist must reckon with the long-term consequences of repeating claims not supported by evidence, especially when they result in irreversible damage. Truth and compassion are not mutually exclusive. Thank you for publishing an article that ­attempts to honour both. Sandra Adams, Baldoyle, Dublin 13 Sir — I read with interest the long-overdue interview with Helen Joyce. I hope this signals the end of the apparent media blackout of Irish groups like The Countess, whose founder and CEO Laoise de Brún has been campaigning on these issues since 2020. It would be refreshing to see more journalists being curious enough to cover all sides in this conversation and not continue to keep their heads in the sand. Sorcha Nic Lochlainn, director and sport ­spokeswoman, The Countess Sir — Like so many of us in ­Ireland, Helen Joyce found out that to even ask questions about gender identity can result in ­being called a bigot. The ­shaming and silencing of people asking sometimes difficult questions is ultimately harming the most vulnerable when it comes to this topic — the young people with gender dysphoria. Thank you for publishing this very important interview. Colette Colfer, Waterford city Sir — I congratulate you on publishing Sarah Caden’s careful interview with Helen Joyce. I will hold off asking “What took you so long?” as it is a question that could be asked broadly of Irish media. The cover of Joyce’s book reads Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality. Let us support children and young people to live in that reality, and look forward to the Irish media reporting on the reality of the evidence and not ideological opinion. Name with editor, Dublin 6 Sir — What a wonderful surprise to see Helen Joyce finally interviewed in a mainstream Irish newspaper. Well past time, of course. Liz Fitzpatrick, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — Following the UK Supreme Court judgment, will we finally see the same ruling apply in ­Ireland, or will minority groups use legislation already in place to demand the same rights as those of biological women? We shall wait and see. Christy Galligan, Letterkenny, Co Donegal Sir — It was great to see Northern Ireland as the subject of an editorial in the ­Sunday Independent (April 13). The question of the future of this island is very important and, in fairness to the Sunday ­Independent, it does treat the ­issue consistently. The editorial raised important issues such as whether talk of unity is a “distraction” and what might be the best way forward. It also raised the important but complex issue of reconciliation. I would be of the opinion that talk of unity can never be a distraction and that we must always be looking for a better way forward for everyone on the island. I accept there will be different views and I welcome strong debate and forthright opinion. Everyone should be challenged. I mostly find, in fact, that other people’s ideas are better than my own. However, the editorial and a column by Máiría Cahill made Leo Varadkar look like an Irish equivalent of Alexei Navalny, someone to be belittled and ­silenced. It is regrettable when an attempt is made to silence other views and to denigrate the person expressing them. None of this is to take away from the fact the Sunday Independent is to be congratulated for consistently keeping the North on the agenda. However, it should play the ball, not the man. Jim D’Arcy, Blackrock, Dundalk, Co Louth Sir — Our older citizens suffer mostly in silence with the enemy of old age — arthritis. Do our major milk companies know how hard it is to open a plastic two-litre bottle of milk now? God forbid we might throw out the containers without the now permanently attached tops. Pouring milk into a cup of tea is hard enough without having to deal with some bright spark’s invention on behalf of the nanny state. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Sir — Aspects of Sinn Féin’s past will never endear me or many of my generation to the party. Nevertheless, one has to respect its determination and appreciate its sustained role in opposition. Across the Atlantic, one of the most disturbing aspects of Donald Trump’s behaviour is the almost complete absence of any opposition to his assault on ­democracy. Whereas Republic­ans would have you believe most of the world is arriving in swooning, ass-kissing waves to the White House, the ­Democrats would be well advised to dispatch a no-nonsense, resuscitation delegation to meet Mary Lou McDonald. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Sir — I read with interest Pat O’Callaghan’s letter in the Sunday Independent of April 13. He wishes to return workers to pre-1990 annual leave entitlement. Might I recommend he read a book by John Timpson, Upside Down Management. This is a ­bible on staff relations. As someone who was a dedic­ated trade union activist for over 45 years, I could not sit in ­silence at this suggestion to erode a hard-earned entitlement. It is as outrageous as ­Finance Minister Jack Chambers announcing the increase in the minimum wage will be delayed. A minister is paid 7.6 times the minimum wage, not to mention the litany of ­allowances. I have always honoured the Starry Plough and always will. Paddy Murray, Castlepollard, Co Westmeath Sir — I read Brighid McLaughlin’s evocative account of modern Belfast (April 13) with keen interest. It brought back sharp memories of my own student days in the city during the 1970s, when it was a very ­different place indeed. Back then, you constantly had to assess your surroundings. My wife often encourages me to go up from Armagh for a day in Belfast, but I usually prefer ­Dublin. There’s still a shadow over the city in my mind, a residue of the fear we lived with. I remember dating a girl from Moy — part of what was then grimlyknown as the Murder ­Triangle — and walking her home at night, petrified by the risks. Not long ago, I met an old friend home from Calgary. We were sitting in a pub in Moy with his daughter, who grew up in Canada. I found myself saying things I hadn’t voiced in years — how, during the Troubles, we would never have sat near a pub window for fear of a car bomb or a random shooting. It shocked her, as it shocks me now. And yet I have nothing but admiration for the people of ­Belfast. Take politics out of it, and they’ll help you with anything. That same wit, warmth and fierce decency McLaughlin captured still shines through. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Sir — I am writing in response to Eilis O’Hanlon’s article (‘If you want us to watch Irish TV shows, make them better’, April 13), which takes issue with the idea of imposing levies on international streaming services to fund local productions. Is it from ignorance or wilful misinformation that Eilis chooses Dancing with the Stars and Home of the Year as the kind of programming that would be supported by this levy? Nothing could be farther from the truth. RTÉ is no friend of quality production, and the Irish film and TV industry has known this for years. The breakdown has already been worked out, with 75pc going to independent productions and a substantial portion to the Irish language. So it is more projects like Kneecap, Small Things Like These, An Cailín Ciúin, The Young Offenders and Bad Sisters that will be made. I hesitate to mention Bodkin. It is polarising, but it is at least something. Countries that have implemented such levies have witnessed significant growth in their local industries. France, for instance, requires that streaming services invest a portion of their revenues in French productions. Between 2021 and 2023, this policy led to an injec­tion of nearly €1bn into the French film and TV sector, resulting in 81 films. Netflix’s investment in Beating Hearts became Studio­Canal’s highest-grossing French release. And Netflix subscription costs in France range from €5 to €3 cheaper than in Ireland, so no additional cost to the consumer. In contrast, the UK, which has yet to adopt such levies, faces challenges in sustaining its domestic productions. The BBC anticipates airing 50 fewer hours of drama this year due to budget constraints, and Channel 4 has halved its commissioning. Unless you require global platforms to contribute fairly to the ecosystems they profit from, they simply won’t. Nothing to do with quality — it’s economics. They will only spend it in the countries that do force them to do it, to the detriment of ours. And let’s face it, the minister’s reluctance to follow through on the levies that have already been agreed has more to do with an avoidance of anything that could look like a “tariff” in the current climate. And that’s a whole other matter. Tom Hopkins, Clare Street, Dublin Sir — I believe, given my own negative health experiences, that multi-storey car parks present a serious health hazard. I have noticed that by the time I get to the shopping centre attached to the car park, I am feeling unwell and slightly dizzy. I feel nauseous nausea and have unusual heartbeats. Why is this? I believe it is caused by the carbon monoxide from the hundreds of vehicles in the car park. It is particularly bad on a dead day with little or no wind. However, even with wind, if you get enough cars you can still have a highly poisonous soup. The Government, and anyone interested in their own health, or public health, should take notice. Maurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork Sir — David Quinn rightly identifies the ludicrous demand made by the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme on the Legion of Mary to contribute over €26m to redress (Opinion, April 13). Within the first decade of its foundation, Frank Duff’s lay Catholic organisation had built the Morning Star Hostel for homeless men along with the Regina Coeli Hostel for women. The latter began to accept pregnant women and unmarried mothers in contravention of the mores of the time. Duff’s new departure to keep mothers and babies drew additional financial pressures on the Legion of Mary. Finola Kennedy in her book Frank Duff: A Life Story outlines that Duff’s vision in keeping mothers and their babies together was dependent on donations from supporters such as WT Cosgrave, Seán MacBride McBrideand Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. The architects of the redress scheme in relation to the Legion of Mary should return to the drawing board. Frank Burke, Terenure, Dublin D6W Sir — It’s ironic that the Farrelly Commission cost €13.6m and discovered nary an abuse. The saying “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” while costing the taxpayers an extortionate amount comes to mind. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir— Donald Trump telling us people have been queuing up to kiss his ass is, for me at least, proof positive that there is a donkey in the White House.

Title: 'My Mom Brings Up Every Excuse In The Book,' Says One Millennial Who Sends Her Money. Asks, 'Anyone Else Doing This Every Month?'

Time Published: 2025-04-20T00:31:31Z
Full Content:
A post on the r/Millennials subreddit has struck a nerve with thousands of users after one woman asked, "Anyone else give your parent(s) money every month?" In the post, the original poster, who said she's a public sector lawyer in her 30s, explained that she's been sending her mother around $4,000 a year for nearly a decade. She also gave her mom a car, chipped in on another one, and gives extra cash on birthdays and holidays. Don't Miss: "I'm not a rich woman either," she wrote, adding that she paid her way through law school with student loans and paid off the debt herself. "But what really irks me," she continued, "is when I mention investments, she tells me, ‘Older people never really invested – we didn't have the same opportunities.'" That's where the conversation blew up. Many Reddit users pushed back on the mom's claim that older generations didn't have access to investing. One 67-year-old commenter wrote: "We had hella great investing opportunities in our generation. Microsoft? Amazon? Apple? Starbucks? Real Estate? Yeah." Another added, "People get mad when I point out millennials have more savings than boomers at their age, but it is actually the truth backed up by many studies. Fact is, millennials know they cannot rely on boomers for support so they save. Boomers expect everyone else to support them so they don’t." Several noted that while OP's father, who's older than her mom, invested regularly and planned ahead, her mother took out a second mortgage and racked up credit card debt instead. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Turns out, plenty of Redditors could relate. Some said they send their parents money monthly, even when it's a financial strain. Others described living with parents or covering expenses like rent, car payments, groceries and phone bills. A few mentioned they expect to support their parents for the rest of their lives, not out of wealth, but out of love and guilt. "[My mom] never held down a job, never saved anything, never invested anything, and she sells anything of value she happens to have the moment she blows through her cigarette money," one commenter wrote. "Now she lives with me because her landlord sold the property, and of course, she and her boyfriend just waited until it happened. " Others admitted they've cut off family members entirely. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Some commenters, especially those from immigrant or Latino families, pointed to cultural expectations. "I'm Latina, and our parents’ generation truly enjoys receiving money from their kids because ‘we are their retirement,’" one user said. "That messed-up way of thinking ends with me, I refuse to think of my only child as my 401(k)." Another user in the Philippines shared that he pays for house help for his parents while his siblings cover the utility bills, even though there's no formal agreement, just an obligation. But others pushed for boundaries. "If you're giving $400 a month and don't know where it's going, that's a problem," one person said. "You're not helping. You're enabling." OP clarified in the thread that her mom did help with childcare early on, but that was years ago. Since then, she's been paying full-time daycare plus her mom's stipend. "It irritates me that she brings up every excuse in the book as to why her finances are bad," she wrote. Still, there were some who said they're happy to help their parents — if only because they know no one else will. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

April 19, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, April 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until Monday, April 28, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D. Cal.), the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit charges Rocket Lab as well as certain of Rocket Lab’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-rocket-lab-usa-inc-class-action-lawsuit-rklb.html You can also contact attorneys J.C.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (ii) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (iii) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (iv) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit.

Title: The Nasdaq 100 Big Caps’ Big Price Drops: Apple, Meta, Nvidia Tesla

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. Nasdaq 100 These Nasdaq 100 Big Caps peaked months ago and have dropped in price steadily since then. Each stock has a separate, individual story but the Trump administration’s tariffs and their effects on prices play a big part on all of them. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the resulting inflation may affect interest rate policy. It’s not a good mix, according to investors who have shown their dislike by selling the shares of these well-known names. What had been hot stocks are now in the cold as ice territory as the price charts show serious downtrends for each. Wall Street is having second thoughts. Apple daily price chart, 4 19 25 The early April slide below the August 2024 low near 195 is quite dramatic. The gap down from about $220 to just above $205 demonstrates the emotional quality to the selling. That buyers did not show up again until stock reached just below $170 does not instill confidence despite the short bounce that followed. That bounce failed to fill the gap down and the price remains below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The tiny red circle shows the spot in early April where the former crossed below the latter, indicating the extent of trend weakness. The iPhone maker has been wounded by the Trump tariffs. Meta Platforms daily price chart, 4 19 25. Meta Platforms Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Controlling Shareholder Mark Zuckerberg cannot be too happy with the recent stock performance of the company. From the February peak of $740 to the current $501 is a two-month drop of 32%. The 50-day moving average is down trending as of late March/early April. The red-dotted line connects the February top with the April high and shows the serious downward slant of the price. Are we about to witness a re-test of the August 2024 low just below the $460 level? Nvidia daily price chart, 4 19 25. The semiconductor giant peaked in January at $152.50 and now goes for $101.49. For those who bought then and continue to hold, that’s a 33% loss. Note that since from that top to early April, the price has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a down trend. The 50-day moving average in mid-March crossed below the 200-day moving average, a further indication of the downward direction of trend. Although the price bounced upward for a few days, it failed to cross above the moving averages. It’s a negative as well that the April low dropped below the August 2024 low. Tesla daily price chart, 4 19 25. The November/December 2024 upward movement bears a certain resemblance to the Seig Heil hand gesture made in public in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Since the mid-December peak of $480 the stock has dropped to its present $241. That’s a 41% loss for those who purchased then and held on. The red circle shows where the 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, an indication of trend weakness. Tesla has managed to stay above the August 2024 low, better than some of the other Nasdaq 100 big caps. A close below that level would not be pleasing to remaining investors.

Title: How To Find Massive Dividend Deals In The Tariff Panic

Time Published: 2025-04-19T13:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Red Tariffs newspaper headlines with assorted economy related topics On one front, this tariff pandemonium changes nothing for us: We still see our favorite high-yield investments—8%-plus paying closed-end funds—as the best choice to anchor your retirement portfolio. In fact, times like this add to their appeal even more. That’s because, in a crash, we CEF investors don’t have to sell a single unit of our funds to get the cash we need to fund our lives. Our big dividends—many of which roll in monthly—take care of our needs for us. Then there’s CEFs’ discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). This unique-to-CEF measure tells us when a fund is cheap or pricey. And right now, thanks to the tariff panic, we’ve got a raft of discounted CEFs to choose from. And there’s one more edge we can exploit with CEFs: the fact that CEF investors are very conservative and lean heavily toward funds with long track records. This tendency to go with the tried-and-true opens up an opportunity for us. That’s because many CEF firms, like Nuveen, PIMCO and BlackRock, have CEFs of all ages in their stables. Here’s the thing, though: Whether the fund is “young” or “old,” they all tend to be run by the exact same people. So we can, in effect, buy a younger CEF and take advantage of its discount. Then we simply ride along as it ages, and its valuation nears that of its older sibling. Let’s zero in on this opportunity by looking at three CEFs from PIMCO, a California-based firm that’s long had a grip on CEF investors’ imaginations: the PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund (PTY), PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS) and PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX). PIMCO’s “brand halo” makes it difficult to buy its funds at a discount. Let’s start with PTY, far and away the oldest of our trio. Launched over 20 years ago, PTY sports an 11.2% yield that investors, well, love. It’s also by far the biggest of the three, with $2.3 billion in assets under management, compared to $910 million for PDX and $665 million for PAXS. On the other side, you have PAXS, with a 12.3% yield, and PDX, which yields 7.9%. PAXS launched at the start of 2022, and PDX is a bit older, having held its IPO in 2019. But even that 2019 date is young by CEF standards; it makes PDX the second-youngest PIMCO CEF on the market. But PTY overshadows its two younger siblings because its age lets investors analyze its long-haul payout history. And that history is very favorable indeed: PTY Dividend Here you can see that PTY’s payouts have been pretty steady over 20 years, which included the pandemic, the subprime-mortgage crisis, and the low interest rates of the 2010s. (The spikes and dips in the purple line above are special dividends.) While it’s true that the regular payouts have dipped a bit (cut 13.6% since the fund’s IPO), the average annualized yield on PTY has been 11.3% for investors who bought at the IPO date, as of this writing. To put that in perspective, someone who bought $100,000 worth of PTY has earned, on average, an income stream of $945 per month (a bit over $11,300 per year) without having to do a single thing. So, you can see why PTY has attracted a premium to NAV throughout its history. This simply means investors are willing to pay more for PTY than its portfolio is worth. It makes sense when you think about it: PTY gives investors a steady paycheck, which encourages them to stick with the fund. As a result, there are fewer shares of PTY on the market, since CEFs—unlike ETFs—tend to have a fixed share count over their lifespans. This means PTY’s market price tends to drift upward more than its NAV does. Although that’s been going up too: PTY Total Returns In total, PTY has earned an 11.7% annualized return on a NAV basis, as of this writing. That’s higher than the 11.3% average yield investors have received, so you can see how PTY has been able to maintain payouts for over two decades. To be clear, for every dollar put in PTY, over $10 in profit has been generated. When you consider that, the fund’s premium to NAV makes even more sense. And it follows that this premium would survive the tariff mayhem: PTY’s record is just too good. Now let’s shift back to the younger PAXS and PDX. They don’t have the track records to attract investors like PTY does, even though they’re managed by the same people. That’s why we have seen PAXS’s premium all but disappear amid the tariff panic, while PDX’s discount has grown wider. PIMCO Discounts This is a clear buy signal, but let me back that call up with another chart showing these funds’ dividend histories. PDX/PAXS Dividend History Now before we go further, yes, PDX’s dividend line (in orange) looks a bit wonky. There are two reasons for that: One, the fund launched just before the pandemic and, at the end of 2020, it cut its distribution by more than half. Two, PDX moved from quarterly payouts to monthly dividends in March 2024, so the dividend went from 26 cents, when the fund paid its last quarterly dividend in March 2024, to 11.3 cents a month. That masked a big raise that looks like a dip in the orange line above. PDX Dividend History In reality, PDX increased its payouts by more than 30% in early 2024. PAXS meantime, has seen one hike to its regular dividend since launch, along with a big special payout in late 2022. That “bonus” payout came as the markets were at their most fearful; thanks to PAXS’s focus on debt, it can ensure strong payouts, even when stock markets are panicking. You’d think strong income plays like these would attract buyers, despite their young ages. And they no doubt will—but not now, with the tariffs causing terror among the most conservative investors. That fear has dragged down both funds’ valuations, making both strong buys. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Earnings Season Kicks Into Gear While Tariffs Dominate Markets

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and ... More Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Despite being mired in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 as a group are expected to grow earning at double the pace of the overall market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 32 companies reported earnings last week, heavily emphasizing bank earnings. Seventy-one percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the first-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 121 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, marking the second-busiest week of the reporting season. S&P 500 Earnings Season The financial sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement, while downward revisions to the technology sector offset the improvement. According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 7.2% year-over-year, equal to the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have faded as concerns about earnings and sales have increased due to the increased tariffs. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Tariff worries weighed on stocks with a 1.5% decline last week. After this week’s pullback, the S&P 500 sits 14% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed last week. The group remains in bear market territory at 26.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns Much was made of the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness in the previous week. The typical doomsayers came out in force to predict some new apocalypse, but several less frightening factors seemed to be at play. Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was back to behaving more typically, with yields falling during the stock market weakness. Most of the decline in yields was from a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors, which reversed some of the increase from the previous week. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Usually, this happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks during these periods. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Recently, there has also been some gnashing of teeth about the U.S. dollar’s depreciation against other currencies. This caused the alarmists to spread worries about the U.S. dollar falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. Indeed, the tariffs or falling U.S. yields could result in some rebalancing within currency reserves, but any dethroning of the king dollar remains a minuscule probability. The fact is that there is currently no suitable replacement for the U.S. dollar. This does not mean the U.S. should abuse its status, but overwrought concerns are not yet warranted. A longer-term history of the dollar shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999. US Dollar Woes? Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow 14.8% year-over-year versus 7.2% for the rest of the S&P 500. The blended earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent 7 is 5.1%. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the second busiest week of reporting season has a plethora of notable companies scheduled, including 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Procter & Gamble (PG), and PepsiCo (PEP). According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. The healthcare sector is benefiting from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which are both expected to swing from losses in the same quarter last year to profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. If these two companies are excluded, the earnings growth rate for healthcare would be 3.6%, according to FactSet. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal gross domestic product growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.3% has slightly undershot expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, once the distortions from the healthcare sector’s accounting are removed, the technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector With relatively few top-tier economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. Markets remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs should be positively correlated with the extent of economic growth headwind. Actual economic data has remained relatively resilient despite the tariff storm. On the other hand, soft data from surveys shows the reasons for the consternation about the economic outlook. For example, consumer sentiment readings have plunged. While this plunge does not guarantee an impending recession, it points to at least some economic softness if the 2022 period is a proper corollary. Consumer Sentiment Consumer sentiment remains very dependent on the political party of those surveyed. Just as the opposite was the case under President Joe Biden in 2022, Democratic sentiment has plunged relative to Republicans under President Donald Trump. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party This week’s earnings reports should provide insight into additional sectors and two of the Magnificent 7. With the tariff overhang and growing concerns about the resilience of the artificial intelligence wave, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched even more closely. Consensus earnings growth estimates for the calendar year 2025 earnings have been reduced, even though the first quarter's earnings have arrived as expected thus far. Generally, at 14% off their highs, stocks expect these tariffs to be temporary and a passing headwind for earnings. This expectation could be valid, but there could be more downside if elevated tariffs are viewed as more permanent and likely to send the global economy into recession. Upside could come from significant trade deals that lessen the headwinds or a pivot from the administration away from tariffs. The short-term forecast for stocks seems even more impossible to predict than ever, but the long-term outlook is almost certainly not at risk. Stocks have outperformed cash, bonds, and inflation by a wide margin over the long term despite many setbacks, many much scarier than tariffs or recession.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices, after swinging wildly along with stocks, are braced for an epic showdown between U.S. president Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has held up better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq as tariff turmoil rocks crypto and equity markets, with billionaire Ray Dalio warning of “monetary order breakdown” that could spell something worse than 2008. Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprising bitcoin price prediction, the chief executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange has said Binance is advising countries on following the U.S. in adopting bitcoin as a strategy reserve asset. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has kick started a race for countries around the world to begin adopting ... More bitcoin—something that could blow up the bitcoin price. "We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves," Richard Teng, who took over the top job at Binance after founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao was ousted when he and the company plead guilty to failing to prevent money laundering in 2023, told the Financial Times without naming the countries. Binance has also "been approached by quite a lot" of countries to "[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto," Teng added. Trump has made passing long-awaited crypto legislation a priority for his second administration, as well as signing an executive order that calls for the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile. “Compared to many other jurisdictions, [the U.S. is] way ahead on that front,” Teng said, adding it’s spurred countries into action. In March, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick predicted the bitcoin price could surge to $500,000 per bitcoin within three years due to the creation of a U.S. bitcoin and crypto reserve. Earlier this month, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan revealed CZ, who still holds a majority stake in Binance, had begun advising them on developing crypto regulations and adoption of bitcoin and crypto. “It makes sense that countries would reach out to industry players to ensure they have informed views on policy,” Anthony Pompliano, the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, said in an emailed note. “This is the game theory that bitcoiners have been talking about for decades. Once one large nation starts to acquire bitcoin, all countries are incentivized to compete to acquire bitcoin … it is not possible to ignore the United States of America—the greatest economy ever constructed in human history. If America says bitcoin is strategically important, then other countries will start seeing the asset that way as well." This month, Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential council of advisers for digital assets, said the U.S. is exploring many ways to increase its bitcoin reserve without using additional taxpayer dollars, including through tariff revenue and revaluing the government’s gold certificates. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin but remains ... More far higher than where it was before the November U.S. election. “We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there’s literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said in an interview with Pompliano. “Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it’s not happening in a silo," David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher BTC Inc, which also organizes the bitcoin conference at which Trump first proposed the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, said in a statement teasing the upcoming Las Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference. "President Trump’s establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many steps he’s taken to promote American innovation," Bailey said. In January, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. Last year, BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto said sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in bitcoin alongside wild speculation that Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund was exploring buying bitcoin.

Title: Big bets on speculative carbon capture tech ignore today’s solutions

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The first step in reducing the risks of climate change is cutting carbon emissions. The world hit a notable milestone on that front, with global energy-related emissions likely peaking last year, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Now, the world’s carbon pollution is likely to begin a long, inexorable decline over the coming decades. But there’s a catch: Emissions almost certainly won’t fall fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5 C target set in the Paris Agreement. Increasingly, hitting that target looks like it will require the world to turn to technologies that can suck carbon straight from the air in a bid to turn the global thermostat down. Investors have spent years laying the groundwork to develop a sector that has the potential to undergird carbon markets that BNEF estimates could reach $1.1 trillion in the coming decades. Companies from Occidental Petroleum to Microsoft along with firms like BlackRock and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures are among the investors throwing billions at startups. The U.S. government has been a significant patron, with the Energy Department committing more than $1 billion to get carbon removal off the ground. But funding and buyers of carbon removal services have so far targeted a narrow subset of techniques to clean the atmosphere. And U.S. federal support is now up in the air as the Donald Trump administration pursues funding cuts to all manner of climate programs. This is happening in what is shaping up to be a formative period for the carbon removal industry as companies attempt the perilous journey from pilot projects to commercialization, said Robert Hoglund, co-founder of carbon removal clearinghouse CDR.fyi. To ensure the industry has a fighting chance to reach the scale needed, it will need an enormous financial boost. "If we don’t get new buyers, we’re stuck in the seed stage,” he said. There are at least eight broad categories for removing carbon to clean up the atmosphere, with more than 900 startups trying different approaches. The money that's been rushing into the carbon chase has overwhelmingly backed a technique known as direct air capture (DAC), which involves using machines to suck up carbon. Firms are placing major bets on it even though the technology remains unproven at scale, inordinately expensive and energy intensive. Far less investor money is flowing to competing methods such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean and using crushed rocks, a process known as enhanced weathering. Between 2020 to 2024, firms have bet $3.3 billion on DAC compared to $3.4 billion for all other novel approaches, according to publicly available data compiled by CDR.fyi. The technology receives a disproportionate amount of private investment because it’s backed by U.S. federal tax credits and grants, according to Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. That support isn’t because the government decided DAC is the best way to remove carbon, he said, but "because the political economy of the oil and gas industry is much more powerful than these other emerging industries.” Carbon removal buyers looking to meet their climate targets have also not diversified their portfolios. Almost 60% of all purchases tracked by CDR.fyi between 2019 and 2024 are for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It involves burning wood to run power plants, then capturing and sequestering the resulting emissions underground. Hence, the CO2 the trees and plants pull from the atmosphere during their lifetimes stays put. Despite the interest, research has found that cutting down and transporting feedstock can emit more carbon than it sequesters, making carbon accounting a big challenge. BECCS made up about 85% of Microsoft’s 8.2 million metric ton portfolio for novel carbon removal through 2024 tracked by CDR.fyi. The technique "offers attractive costs with an achievable scale inside the 2030 timeline,” said Brian Marrs, the company’s senior director of energy and carbon removal. Bioenergy plants already exist, and retrofitting them for carbon capture is arguably faster than building and scaling novel carbon removal technology. Since 2024, Microsoft has only added to its BECCS portfolio, signing a landmark 6.75 million ton deal with Houston-based developer Fidelis New Energy earlier this month to purchase removal from a plant being built near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It’s the largest deal for novel carbon removal to date. The company also recently added another 3.7 million ton purchase from CO280 Solutions, which captures CO2 from pulp and paper mills, reflecting Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its climate commitments. Microsoft takes a "portfolio approach” to procuring carbon removal, balancing costs, deployment timelines and scale potential for different methods, Marrs said, adding that the company also purchases nature-based carbon credits in addition to engineered removals. BECCS’s dominance is not to say DAC or other technologies haven’t seen big purchases. According to CDR.fyi, Oxy subsidiary 1PointFive has sold 1.3 million tons of carbon removal services to companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Airbus, making it the largest DAC purveyor. Its next-closest competitors, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, have each sold a bit more than a quarter of that amount. Yet these approaches have yet to live up to their promise. Through 2024, DAC delivered around 1,200 tons of CO2 removal — less than 0.2% of all carbon removed over that time frame — and BECCS has delivered 10,000 tons — less than 1.7% of the total — per CDR.fyi. Just a handful of companies are buying the bulk of carbon removal credits. Microsoft alone is responsible for the majority of carbon removal purchases to date, though Alphabet’s Google and Stripe are also among major buyers. That’s because durable removal isn’t cheap. Using DAC can cost upwards of $1,000 per ton of CO2. Compare that to standard forest carbon credits, which are often sold for under $10. "The only way to make this scale is to make it mandatory,” said Wim Carton, an associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden. Carbon removal is a public good governments should treat as akin to a "trash removal service,” said Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global public policy and external affairs. That approach should also include sticks, he added, much like littering results in a fine. But with Trump — who has called former President Joe Biden’s climate legislation "the green new scam” — the odds of the U.S. doubling down on climate regulation are low. What climate scientists want investors and entrepreneurs to understand is that carbon removal has a narrow set of appropriate use cases. The first is cleaning up legacy emissions. Decades of humanity’s CO2 is lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. If the Earth were an overflowing bathtub, turning the faucet off — cutting emissions — wouldn’t be enough to stop the water from spilling over. You also need to open the drain. The second use is for the unavoidable, steady drip of CO2 for decades from sectors like agriculture and aviation. All other applications of carbon clean-up technologies could do more harm than good since they risk slowing down emissions cuts today by promising removals down the road, Carton said. That’s especially true for using captured CO2 to extract more fossil fuels, a practice that climate researchers agree needs to be rapidly wound down. Exactly how much carbon the world needs to remove from the atmosphere depends on how quickly that happens. In a scenario where humanity dramatically curbs emissions, scientists estimate that 4.8 billion tons of CO2 removal will be needed annually by mid-century to keep the climate stable with all of it coming from conventional methods like planting trees. In what’s an increasingly likely scenario of continuing to burn fossil fuels, the planet will require almost 9.8 billion tons annually to compensate for the added emissions with 3.5 billion of that from novel techniques like DAC. The world is nowhere near that. Through 2024, about 13 million tons of carbon removal credits have been sold since CDR.fyi began tracking the market for novel carbon removal, what Cullenward called "a rounding error.” The clock is ticking on scaling that up. "We’re far too late, and we’ve eaten up too much of the carbon budget to say that we don’t need it,” said Sabine Fuss, co-chair of the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. While DAC and BECCS are attracting the most investment and purchases respectively, they’re crowding out other promising carbon removal technologies. Some startups use clever engineering to accelerate natural processes, like increasing the ocean’s alkalinity. Others are electrolyzing seawater and spreading crushed basalt rock over farmland. These methods promise greater durability, verifiability and effectiveness of storing CO2 than simply planting trees. Another method has provided the majority of all carbon removal delivered: biochar. It’s done so without the support of U.S. tax credits, large purchases from brand-name buyers or billions in investments. In some ways, biochar is the "unrecognized star” of carbon removal, said Carton. Compared to other methods, it’s cheap and doesn’t require much upfront capital expenditure or high-tech research and development. Making it requires kilns to heat biomass, and the resulting charcoal-like product can also be used to help improve soil fertility. But like all carbon removal techniques, there are downsides, the biggest being uncertainty about how much CO2 stays sequestered when it’s added to different soils. That’s an area of active investigation for researchers. "It’s got so much potential, but it’s inconclusive,” said Ben Kolosz, an assistant professor in renewable energy and carbon removal at the University of Hull in the U.K. Still other methods like ocean alkalinity enhancement and enhanced rock weathering hold even greater promise to capture and store vast amounts of CO2. But they are not as "approachable” or "intuitive” as technologies like DAC, which may give investors and would-be buyers pause, said Anu Khan, founder and executive director of the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative. CDR.fyi’s Hoglund compared the carbon removal industry’s efforts to the pharmaceutical industry's pursuit of new drugs. "You need huge upfront investments for it to work,” said Hoglund, who is also the manager of the Milkywire Climate Transformation Fund, an organization that supports carbon removal, decarbonization and nature-based projects. That ultimately means securing committed buyers with deep pockets. "We need many Microsofts to start scaling this,” he said.

Title: Trump's trade war is spooking first-time investors. 4 need-to-know tips for stock-market newcomers.

Investing your money in the stock market is a great way to grow your wealth in the long term, and the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to compound. While that sounds straightforward, current market conditions might give aspiring investors reason for pause. The S&P 500 is down almost 10% year-to-date as stocks continue to sell off from trade war concerns. Kristen Jauregui made it her goal to start investing this year, but she's been discouraged by the market volatility and has decided to wait until things calm down before buying in. The possibility of investing money into the market and immediately seeing it shrink after another tariff negotiation triggers a sell-off is unappealing to her. "It's something that I had been trying to get involved in because it's time to diversify my assets, it's time to grow my money so I have a better future later on, but with the way that everything is shifting right now, I get anxiety reading the news," Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist, told Business Insider. Harry Woodland started investing in stocks during the week of April 7, just as tariff news was swinging the market wildly. He began by buying ETFs tracking the global stock market and individual companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), he said. "I'm actually investing a little bit after the tariffs came out, so I'm sort of catching up," the 27-year-old, who runs a landscaping business, told BI. "I definitely have concerns about the whole geopolitical situation. It's a very, very volatile market right now." If you're in a similar boat to Jauregui and Woodland, fear not. Katie Klingensmith, the chief investment strategist at Edelman Financial Engines, has the following advice for those who are looking to dip their toes into investing but aren't sure how to start. The most important thing is having a regular plan, according to Klingensmith. It could be as simple as putting $50 into your portfolio every paycheck, as long as you're following a consistent buying schedule — a practice known as dollar cost averaging where you buy when the market is both up and down. This will create healthy financial habits and help you build up your portfolio at a steady pace, she said. "Even if they're relatively small amounts, over the long term those compound dramatically, so investing a little bit early can make a huge difference over the long run," Klingensmith said. You might be tempted to save up your cash and wait until you have a larger sum to invest, but that's not necessary and might actually be suboptimal. It's hard to time the market correctly and enter at the right point. "If you're systematically buying every paycheck, then sometimes you're going to be buying at the absolute cheapest point, sometimes at a medium point, and sometimes at a more expensive point," Klingensmith said. It's OK to not buy in at the low all the time — dollar cost averaging helps investors smooth out the cost of investing. If it's your first foray into the stock market, stick with the basics, like index funds, ETFs, and blue-chip stocks, Klingensmith said. For those with a longer investing horizon, it makes sense to have a higher risk tolerance as there's more time to weather the ups and downs of the market. Younger investors can often put up to 100% of their portfolio into equities and gradually dial down the risk as they age. Woodland's applying this mindset to his investing strategy and taking some risks on individual stocks while he's young. "The Big Tech stuff in my portfolio does worry me a bit, but it's offset by my recovery period. I've got a long time to invest," Woodland told Business Insider. Steer clear of the more complicated investment vehicles though, Klingensmith warns. "Lots of people are talking about private credit, private debt, or real estate," Klingensmith said. "It doesn't tend to be for the smaller investor because at least at this point, those investments are hard to get into and out of." Examples of index funds that provide broad exposure to the market include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT), and the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH). Staying diversified sounds deceptively simple, but it's often hard to heed this tip when the stock market is doing well. For example, if you started investing last year, you might have been tempted to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to Magnificent Seven stocks due to their stellar performance. Now, you might be wishing that you had more exposure to the utilities sector. While it's exciting to invest thematically, such as betting big on the AI trend, that's not the best foundation to base your portfolio on, according to Klingensmith. "The winners within the stock market change. Five years ago nobody would have dreamed that AI would have been this much of a leader in 2024," Klingensmith said. "If you are purchasing a broad basket of securities, you're much more likely to have some winners." Both institutional and retail investors had been betting on US exceptionalism fueling stocks in the last couple of years, but the trade war has proven that the strategy isn't watertight. "Honestly, prior to the tariffs, I would have invested my money into an S&P 500 fund, but I've actually decided to go for the Invesco FTSE All World fund, mainly because I don't really feel comfortable in investing wholly in US stocks," Woodland said. "Now, I understand that the All World fund is around 60% US stocks. However, I do feel like I can sleep better at night knowing that there is the insurance of having international exposure as well." Before you start investing, you should be aware of your risk tolerance, financial goals, and emotions. Whether you like it or not, investing is an inherently emotional experience, Klingensmith cautions. "I can't say enough that all of us, myself absolutely included, are emotional at times like this, and it's hard not to want to sell investments because they've gone down," she said. Her advice? Don't go for more risky investments if you know you can't handle the stress. Define your financial goals and time horizon, and keep a long-term mindset by avoiding checking on your portfolio daily. Klingensmith added that it's not a bad idea to derisk your portfolio and hold more cash at times. Especially during an economic downturn, keeping cash on hand for easy access can be more valuable than investing in the stock market. "It's OK to focus on that cash cushion in the short term, just given the amount of uncertainty that's everywhere, not just in financial markets," Klingensmith said. Jump to

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years.

That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing.

Title: The Rise And Rise Of Reinforcement Learning: AI’s Quiet Revolution

ByPaul X. McCarthy ByPaul X. McCarthy, Contributor. Reinforcement learning is a analogous to the way the Easter Egg hunt game works with high-level ... More hot/cold feedback about how close to the mark one is and players may after time be able to generalise this to learn about likely hiding spots for eggs like in trees, under pot-plants in bushes for example. A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it’s not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That’s reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by “warmer” or “colder” hints. This approach isn’t just changing how machines learn; it’s redefining what intelligence means. Illustrating the Three Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement ... More Learning To grasp Reinforcement Learning’s s ascent, let’s first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning: Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That’s where Reinforcement Learning can help. Global interest in Reinforcement Learning has exploded since nature published two Google papers that ... More used to show how it could be used to train an AI to play Atari games (2015) and then that defeated the worlds Go champion (2016) Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It’s less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained “agent” mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world’s Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don’t exist. It doesn’t need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success. Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity: While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker’s value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic "Wintel" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows. NVIDIAGPT Synergy: NVIDIA Share Price (Blue) Surges Alongside ChatGPT Global Search Interest (Green) ... More After Its 2022 Launch However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT’s performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek’s research quickly gained traction. Their paper, “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources.

Its trial-and-error mimics human learning, prompting big questions. If machines can replicate this, what defines intelligence? If they spot patterns we can’t, what might we learn about our world? Andrew Ng and Toby Walsh, in conversation at UNSW Sydney, 2024. Andrew's PhD was in Reinforcement ... More Learning, now over two decades ago. Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, “My PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning… and my team worked on a robot.” His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning’s potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don’t just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn’t a footnote in AI’s story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.

The stakes ratchet up in the All-Ireland League on Saturday as the competition shifts from 18 rounds and eight months of league action to the playoffs in all five divisions. In Division 1A only six points separated the top four and there’s little in the way of a form guide judging by previous clashes. St Mary’s College v Cork Constitution, Templeville Road, live on irishrugby+: Promoted St Mary’s have taken the division by storm (witness 13 try-scoring bonus points in 18 games) to earn a home semi-final against the champions. A single point separated them in the table and ditto in their two meetings; a 27-27 draw at Temple Hill in November and Con’s 30-29 win at Templeville Road in January. St Mary’s fielded a weakened side in Clontarf a fortnight ago but Mark McHugh is expected to recall key man Conor Dean at outhalf and summer signings Greg Jones and Dan Goggin. Con make two changes from their 47-45 win over Terenure. Veteran centre Niall Kenneally is restored and, with Mark Donnelly on Munster duty, David Good starts at loosehead. They are seeking to become the first club to retain the AIL title since Shannon in 2006. Clontarf v Lansdowne, Castle Avenue (4pm) Live on irishrugby+: Emulating Clontarf’s astonishing 49-46 win at the same venue in January will be nigh impossible, as a 12-try rollercoaster was won by Conor Kelly’s penalty with the last kick. Clontarf are seeking to regain the title they won in 2022 before losing in the final a year later, and with a largely rebuilt side. They tend to be clinical after gaining access to the opposition’s 22, and that January extravaganza was one of five games that they have won with the last play. They make just one change to the side that sealed a home semi-final by beating St Mary’s a fortnight ago, with Stephen Ryan starting on the left-wing and two players added to their bench as sides are allowed 23-man squads in the knock-out stages. By contrast, Lansdowne rested most of their frontliners for the win over Garryowen a fortnight ago. Hence, Declan Fassbender recalls 11 players, with Charlie Tector starting at inside centre. Lansdowne, who beat ‘Tarf 26-17 at home back in November, have won eight of their last nine matches as they aim for their first final since 2018. The weather may possibly be more to Clontarf’s liking. City of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Nenagh Ormond v Blackrock College, New Ormond Park: City of Armagh surprisingly slipped into ninth in 1A, whereas UCC climbed into fourth in 1B, on the last day. The students include four recent or current Ireland under-20/Munster academy players in Ben O’Connor, Gene O’Leary Kareem, Seán Odogbu and Michael Foy. Although Nenagh Ormond finished six points above Blackrock, their two wins over them were tight – 38-36 away in September and 21-17 at home three weeks ago. James Blaney is seeking yet another promotion with ‘Rock, who are missing injured Ireland under-20 scrumhalf Oliver Coffey. Cashel v MU Barnhall, Spafield (2.30pm); Dublin University v Greystones, College Park (2.30pm): Cashel and Barnhall also met in last season’s playoffs, the latter winning by two points in Spafield before losing to Queen’s in the playoff final. Barnhall finished second, one point above Cashel, thanks in part to a 30-17 home win over the Tipperary club in January and two bonus points from a 36-33 loss in the February reverse fixture. Trinity are trying to avoid successive relegations and will be favourites at home to Greytones, who finished fourth in 2A. Cashel finished just one point above Barnhall. Dungannon v Clogher Valley, Stevenson Park (2.30pm); Navan v Galwegians, Old Balreask (2.30pm): Navan finished ninth in 2A in their centenary season, and will host Galwegians, who had theirs a year previously, after the Galway club squeezed into fourth in 2B at the end of a fairly luckless campaign in which eight of their nine losses were by a score. Forwards coach Jarrad Butler starts for them, with this season’s Ireland under-20 captain Éanna McCarthy a replacement. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in an Ulster derby after finishing 16 points above them. Midleton v Dolphin, Towns Park (2.30pm); Skerries v Ballyclare, Holmpatrick (2.30pm): Midleton host Dolphin after finishing three pints above their Cork rivals courtesy in part to a 15-all draw away and an 18-13 win in Towns Park. Skerries have to reset their sights on the playoffs after slipping into ninth on the final day by points difference while Ballyclare are in bonus territory at the end of their first AIL season.

Title: XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight

With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge. According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. In a recent podcast, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP. The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs. The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments. More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Canary Capital on Friday filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The staking feature of the Canary Staked TRX ETF would allow investors to earn extra yield with their investment. The fund’s “investment objective is to seek to provide exposure to the price of Tron,” the filing said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary has filed for a number of crypto ETFs. The fledgling crypto-focused asset manager is hoping Wall Street’s biggest regulator will give the green light to Sui, Pudgy Penguins, and XRP funds. Those applications are part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, a result of last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have garnered more than $35 billion in net inflows over a 15-month period. The prospectus, also called a registration statement, did not say on which exchange the proposed fund would trade. Staking, the process of pledging proof-of-stake assets to a network to help it function in exchange for rewards, has been a controversial issue in regulators’ consideration of crypto ETFs. Proponents maintain that staking will lead to wider institutional adoption of crypto products, but critics view it as an unnecessary risk for investors. The SEC has yet to approve a staking feature in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator delayed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum. Tron, which trades as TRX and is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was recently trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain, and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares and VanEck are among the long list of major fund issuers currently seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs tracking different digital assets. Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs are the most likely to receive approval next.

Title: Bill Ackman Is Betting on Car Rental Giant Hertz to be a Tariff Winner

President Trump’s auto tariffs may have sparked fears of price hikes among consumers, but some car-buying businesses could actually benefit, according to investor Bill Ackman. The Pershing Square Capital Management founder made a bullish case for Hertz yesterday (April 17), after revealing a nearly 20 percent stake in the car rental company. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Hertz is uniquely well-positioned in the current tariff environment,” Ackman wrote in a post on X. As 25 percent levies on imported cars drive up used car prices, the value of Hertz’s fleet—around 500,000 vehicles worth roughly $1.2 billion—will rise in tandem, he argued. A 10 percent increase in used car values would boost the company’s fleet value by $1.2 billion, nearly half of Hertz’s current market cap. Shares of Hertz surged more than 44 percent following the disclosure of Ackman’s 19.8 percent stake. Hertz has had its fair share of troubles in the past few years. After declaring bankruptcy in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company pivoted hard to electric vehicles—placing a costly bet on Tesla that fell flat due to soft demand. In February, Hertz reported a $2.9 billion loss for 2024 and said it had sold off 30,000 EVs from its fleet. Ackman, who began building his position in the company last year, is betting on a successful turnaround—and a stock price that could more than triple to $30 per share by 2029. That task falls in the hands of Hertz’s new CEO Gil West, who stepped into the role in early 2024. West is focused on “rotating Hertz’s fleet, increasing unit revenues, and reducing operating costs” to “significantly improve profit margins over the next several years,” Ackman said. In a note to employees today (April 18), West praised Ackman’s support and described it as an “testament to our progress,” according to Bloomberg. Ackman also highlighted Hertz’s advantageous position in an “oligopoly.” He noted that Hertz and its two rivals, Enterprise and Avis, currently control around 95 percent of the car rental market. Praising Enterprise as the best-run of the trio, Ackman pointed to its estimated 20 percent profit margin as evidence “that the car rental business can be very profitable.” Ackman floated the possibility of a partnership between Hertz and Uber (UBER)—another company Pershing Square has taken a sizable stake in. “What if [Uber] partnered with Hertz on an [autonomous vehicle] fleet roll out over time?” he suggested, hinting at a potential conversation with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. With its large fleet, global footprint and expertise in vehicle maintenance, Hertz would “make it an ideal partner” for Uber, Ackman said. Uber seems open to the idea. “Hertz has been a great partner of ours,” Khosrowshahi responded on X. “Excited to brainstorm on how we can expand our relationship!” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises specter of investors losing trust in U.S. under Trump

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is “ripping off” America, as Trump puts it. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called it, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost." Teach, lead, and inspire! Unlock your dream career with Jstyle Good news for most of us here in Japan. It's still a long ways to go, and the fundamentals, like the interest rate differential, could get even worse, as Powell signals inflation ahead and the BOJ's darkening outlook for Japan's economy. . demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt The writer is ignorant. Large or growing fiscal debts by major economies with sovereign currencies make no difference to investors. Strange sell-off in the dollar raises specter of investors losing trust in U.S. under Trump The only ones who aren't "losing trust in US under Trump" are his insane cult members. All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings. They have just been waiting for the right time. Golds recent meteoric rise is no coincidence either! ...I would have thought a nations debt level and ability to service that debt would be a forefront issue with investors. I recall Argentina in the early 80s defaulting on many outside loans, seeing a drop in incoming investment as the country spiraled into hyperinflation. Well, if the dollar falls a lot, it will be easier to sell products, and normally, but maybe not this time, we could expect lots of tourists. However, if everyone who looks foreign ìs being deported or abused, it's not a welcoming feeling for those tourists. Just investors? Everyone has lost trust in this Loser - if they ever had any... Especially all those that voted for him and are now jobless, their retirement gutted, and headed toward poverty... STRS is epidemic in Red States - Sudden Trump Remorse Syndrome... American spend money so.fast,they have no idea of it real value More and more Americans are blaming the Financial Felon and Fool for our economy tanking... Tanking - like his poll numbers... "Americans are starting to see through Donald Trump’s economic promises as he continues to tank the economy with his volatile approach to global trade. A new poll from The Economist/YouGov, conducted April 13–15, shows that Trump’s economic approval is at an all-time low. Fifty-two percent of respondents said the economy is getting worse, up 5 percent from “Liberation Day,” when Trump implemented reciprocal tariffs of 10 percent or more on about 90 countries, sending stock markets plummeting to a generational low. He then rescinded the majority of those tariffs days later (but increased the ones on China), causing confusion and chaos for consumers and small-business owners. Three-quarters of voters said they thought tariffs “will increase the price of goods they buy,” and about two-thirds of Americans think the state of the stock market is Trump’s fault, according to the YouGov poll." The Euro is the only currency big enough to really share the dollar's position as a means of exchange in international markets. Given that the ISA is no longer part of "the West" in the traditional sense, itay be appropriate to plan a transition to the eurozone's currency. I have read MAGA will remain enamoured as long as the people they dont like are getting hurt. The USG is no longer reliable or trustworthy. Policies change daily. It is ruled by the executive orders of someone you wouldn't buy a used car from. Brexit took 25% off Sterling. There is no reason why Trump's ideological idiocy shouldn't do the same to the US dollar. Which would be good news for the rest of us. The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. This is part of Trump's "master plan". He wants a weaker dollar to make us goods cheaper abroad and increase exports boosting US manufacturing. There is some logic to this but I along with many others are doubtful it will be very successful. The dollar was 110-115 yen for years and was fine. what’s the dollar/yen rate now that is causing such concern? 142 you say? lol The US Bank will be broke, American will not have access to their money If all creditors to the US called for repayment, the US could not comply. Sounds broke already. Watching gold prices is a good indicator of investor sentiment . All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings. You have the wrong country. It isn't China that is selling off bonds, but rather something orchestrated by the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in cooperation with the key EU economies and Japan. https://lawandsocietymagazine.com/carneys-checkmate-how-canadas-quiet-bond-play-forced-trump-to-drop-tariffs/ And obtw, if you think what Mark Carney is doing with his slow bleed bond sell off isn't noticed by the US consider that Jupiter hasn't dared call him "governor" or made any more jokes about Canada as a 51st state. Mark Carney is a central banker. He knows what he is doing is hurting the US. He's squeezing Jupiter like a lemon. Jupiter has to tread carefully with him because he is one wily Canadian with the chops to do some real harm. The only ones who aren't "losing trust in US under Trump" are his insane cult members. Yes, so insane, we kept winning when the left said, we are losing and we are a cult and insane, strange Other countries aren't stupid: they see the US is being led by a belligerent idiot and they don't want any exposure to that. BlacklabelToday 08:52 am JST The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. It's going to be replaced overseas with the Euro and the Yuan. SanjinosebleedToday 07:17 am JST All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings That would blow up their own economy as well and not just from getting pennies on the dollar for what they are selling. It's going to be replaced overseas with the Euro and the Yuan. and when will this supposedly happen? didn’t the yuan recently hit a near 20 year low against the “weakened” US dollar? Also, obvious most commodities, other than Gold and a few 'safe haven' types, selling off, putting pressure on DXY or dollar index. Ending global wars helps currencies relative to commodities, dollar less so given its run-up Many factors for US dollar weakening. BIG one is reductions to US Govt. Spending coming soon with DJT's first budget starting Oct 1st. Speaker Johnson has promised to cut US Govt. spending "by at LEAST $800 Billion", that's going to help lower US inflation and US interest rates. How will he achieve such spending cuts? Speaker Johnson's working closely with Elon Musk and DOGE and believes the Social Security Programs to include Medicare and Medicaid can eliminate payments made to those who are not illegible ($fraudsters) and illegal Aliens not entitled to receive such benefits. Another factor putting pressure on US dollar is US Govt. headcount reductions, +10% of civilian workforce already reduced with more on the way and many agencies seeing their budgets cut, especially NGO monies. Reducing US Govt. bond issuance to finance Govt. deficit = lower interest rates, inflation, thus weaker US$ Anyone interested in HOW US Govt. will massively cut its spending, thus weakening US$ via lower interest rates and inflation, should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March Podcast, Part 1, fascinating stuff should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March podcast Louder with Crowder and Tucker Carlson recommendations. Sometimes you think we deserve the giant asteroid. Leave the place to the invertebrates. Not just a weakening dollar, bond markets are teetering and the that stock market keeps on sliding sliding sliding. His diehard fans won't be convinced until their 401ks are completely empty and they have no social security. Bond markets teetering? Interest rates have dropped substantially since Jan 20th, especially short duration, as inflation is now the lowest since DJT 1.0. That's called a bond market rally! should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March podcast Louder with Crowder and Tucker Carlson recommendations. Sometimes you think we deserve the giant asteroid. Leave the place to the invertebrates. No need for insults, currency markets carefully tracking Elon Musk and his DOGE advisory efforts to reduce large US Govt. structural deficits, thus reducing US Govt. bond issuance, interest rates, inflation = weaker US$ Most believe Elon Musk is no fool and worth listening to. Most Americans strongly approve of DOGE's efforts to improve US Govt. efficiency and will really approve when DOGE issues taxpayers $5K Refund Checks next Year! It’s not strange at all! It has to do with lack of TRUST. Money confiscation is a thing in the US not only domestically but internationally too. https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-treasury-sanctions-assets-congress-0a3bc97a2d6d77ce3650c767db6ea7ed Putting money at risk has a distinct unsettling effect…. The weaponization of the dollar caused it to cease being a safe haven. I cannot imagine owning Chinese Communist Party Yuan instead of US dollars anytime soon. I did sell some US bonds recently, but that was only so that I could use the money to buy stocks while they are cheap. Trump gas had it wrong on tariffs and is eagerly trying to make deals in three to four weeks with everyone, so history is going to show that this recent dip in US assets including the dollar was a good buying opportunity. But I won't be selling any of my gold. That is the only alternative out there, and probably that's why it's gone from the 1,800 - 2,000 range to 3,300 USD in recent years. As an investor I like what I see in terms of the spending restraint plans coming out of the US government The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. That was a mic drop! It’s not strange at all! It has to do with lack of TRUST. Money confiscation is a thing in the US not only domestically but internationally too. Elon Musk's making himself available, via several hours of interviews with Tucker Carlson, via DOGE. That's transparency, something that's been sorely missing. Why DOGE's digital audit's so important, as now we finally have actual transparency, hard data. Govt. IT being modernized as result to reduce such Govt. financial 'control' issues moving forward. US taxpayers overwhelmingly support DOGE's mission. US$ very connected to interest rates, inflation and Govt. Deficits, caused by wasteful Govt. $spending. Speaker Johnson working now closely working with DOGE, Elon Musk, and has announced huge cuts to Govt. spending starting in Oct this year as a result. Most Americans and Financial Markets distrusted US Govt. and now due to DOGE are gaining TRUST due to the daily objective transparency regarding their findings. Reducing US Govt. Spending by making it more efficient, reducing waste, fraud and abuse due to DOGE will greatly strengthen long-term TRUST in the US$ and act to protect the credit rating of the America. 55% of Americans disapprove of Trump's tariffs and lack of economic progress. A survey of 1000 Americans showed Trump with a 43% approval and a 55% disapproval rating on his handling of the economy. Gee, 'a survey of 1,000 Americans' shows zip, zero, nada regardless of what you think of Trump. The US has around 330 million people, some of you need to take time out from your political hatreds and think in a rational way. Quoting that 'statistic' as some kind of authoritative judgement is just symptomatic of the fact that many people cannot have a grown up debate and discussion about politics anymore. But but but 1,000 people outta 330 million think/say......................... Moribund currency. Oh, all my income is in US Dolor,(pain). Trump loses public support during his first 3 months in office https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-loses-public-support-during-his-first-3-months-in-office/ Trump is pursuing big agenda items regarding the US$ and US economy and naturally voters are waiting for results regarding US Govt. efficiency due to DOGE advisory and trade and tariff policies to promote US manufacturing re-shoring and far reciprocal trade. US voters know DJT has an economic plan, versus Biden and Harris who had no plan. However, DJT's plan is now being implemented, so results will take time, including major US Govt. budget negotiations now under way. Given above, not surprising US$ has weakened, too much uncertainty remains, currency markets like US voters, waiting for results! I cannot imagine owning Chinese Communist Party Yuan instead of US dollars anytime soon. You don't have to. There are increasing number of nations in the world that detest everything the US represents who are interested in an alternative to trading with the US Dollar. You might be surprised how hated the US is outside its borders. Trump is pursuing big agenda items regarding the US$ and US economy and naturally voters are waiting for results regarding US Govt. efficiency due to DOGE advisory and trade and tariff policies to promote US manufacturing re-shoring and far reciprocal trade. Jupiter and his advisors don't have the slightest idea how macroeconomics works. Their laughable "tariff" calculation used a wildly inaccurate elasticity value in the denominator of 0.25 when the true value used by actual practicing economists is closer to 0.97. What that difference means is that the "tariffs" that are not the actual tariffs imposed by US trade partners but rather a measure of the trade balance, is high by a factor of four. Done with the correct elasticity value that stated "tariffs" should be a quarter of what they are. This is just one example of the bumbling incompetence of the people who surround Jupiter, put there not for their expertise but because they will fawn over him and do as they are told. And you have fallen for their flim flam. Meanwhile Mark Carney, someone who lives and breathes macroeconomics knows how to tighten the screws on the US and is doing so in cooperation with other nations. The US does not come out of this better than it was before tariffs. fxgaiApr. 20 05:04 pm JST As an investor I like what I see in terms of the spending restraint plans coming out of the US government Completely ham handed slashing at things for political reasons?

("Rocket Lab" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: RKLB) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. READ MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy? “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Title: These Groceries Are the Most Likely to Be Affected by Tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-18T20:44:00Z

We asked an agriculture and economics expert about where consumers can expect food price hikes in the future. Grocery prices may rise even further if Trump's tariffs go back into effect. President Donald Trump's trade war has been a wild-moving target with severe economic implications. The most recent announcement and subsequent 90-day pause of tariffs affected thousands of imports from dozens of countries and sent the stock market reeling, but what could sweeping tariffs on China and other countries mean for food and grocery prices? Hours before the pause on Trump's newest tariffs was announced, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for everyday shoppers in the US. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are If you're just catching up, on April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. Days later, when the tariffs went into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. While it's still unclear whether the Trump Administration will extend the 90-day pause on the rest of the previously announced tariffs, the large tariff on China could still have an impact on American food costs. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge [or tariff] on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the European Union -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." The tariffs may cause supply issues leading to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Many of the Avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump Administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal promoter of Bitcoin, stoked renewed chatter among crypto circles with his recent enigmatic tweet. Thursday’s message stating merely “Bitcoin is Calling” left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. The company recently acquired 3,450 Bitcoin at a price of $285 million. This was done after a short one-week break from their consistent acquisition pattern. Strategy has been steadfast in its aggressive acquisition strategy despite the fact that nearly all of its crypto acquisitions since November 18 have been made at higher-than-current market prices, according to reports. Saylor’s post might be a tease regarding another future purchase, given his history of sending such sarcastic remarks ahead of new acquisitions. The post also appeared to urge his 4.2 million followers to purchase BTC, which he has frequently called “the future of money.” Bitcoin is Calling. pic.twitter.com/0jo19Qbr5q — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 17, 2025 Strategy’s shares have trounced the performance of America’s largest technology stocks, Saylor’s Wednesday filing showed. The crypto-focused firm has posted an astonishing 130% gain over the last year. These returns more than dwarf the returns of Tesla (57%), NVIDIA (30%), Apple (17%), Meta (4%), and Alphabet (2%). There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7. pic.twitter.com/TlD57hW0w0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 15, 2025 Some top tech firms actually lost value during the same period. Amazon and Microsoft saw drops of 2% and 7% respectively. These comparisons highlight the significant rewards Strategy has reaped from its heavy crypto investment strategy. The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin’s link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is “the most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.” A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin’s singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as “the most important number in finance.” He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn’t elaborated in coverage. The chairman’s most recent statement comes as Strategy maintains its focus of continuing to buy Bitcoin for the long term, no matter what happens in the short term. With the company’s shares outperforming technology giants and Saylor’s ongoing public support, most crypto observers are now looking to see if another significant purchase of crypto comes after his cryptic “calling” tweet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report. The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards. Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange’s model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins. Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation. The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities. Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions. Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers. Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line. Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area. The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers. In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone. The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets. The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC. As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 18, 2025 14:36 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta's antitrust trial heats up: Here's what we learned in week one
URL: https://qz.com/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-week-1-zuckerberg-1851776650
Time Published: 2025-04-18T18:06:00Z
Full Content:
In week one of the Federal Trade Commission’s blockbuster monopoly trial against Meta (META-1.69%), CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent around 10 hours on the stand as the agency questioned him about revealing emails from another era. This trial is only just getting started. Throughout it, the FTC will argue that Facebook engaged in a “buy or bury” ploy to eliminate its rivals and gain monopoly power in the social media market. Meanwhile, Meta will make the case that it is responsible for its acquisitions’ runaway successes — and that even after buying Instagram (in 2012) and WhatsApp (in 2014), Meta still faces formidable competition from the likes of TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL+1.23%). At stake is Zuckerberg’s $1.27 trillion social media empire; if the FTC gets its way, Meta will be forced to give up Instagram and WhatsApp, eliminating “up to half of its ad business,” Jasmine Enberg, vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer, told Quartz earlier this week. The research firm expects Instagram alone to represent 50.5% of Meta’s U.S. ad revenue this year. Instagram and WhatsApp are both critical to Meta’s continued growth as legacy social app Facebook loses momentum with young people. Read on for a look at some of the key takeaways from the trial’s first week, including Zuckerberg’s old emails and the price Meta reportedly tried to pay to avoid the trial altogether. “The FTC kicked off the case with the biggest witness on its list. Only one other witness, the FTC’s economics expert Scott Hemphill, is slated to spend anywhere near as long on the stand as Mr. Zuckerberg,” Holland & Hart antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email to Quartz. “Yet while the FTC confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with cringeworthy emails about Facebook’s schemes to beat back competition in the 2010s, none of that hit the key question: Is Meta currently maintaining a monopoly by virtue of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?” According to Swanson, the agency didn’t get the “critical testimony it needs to show that Meta dominates a narrow market that excludes other social media platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn (MSFT+0.24%).” Swanson added, “Mr. Zuckerberg deftly described a market in which Meta’s power is checked by competition from those companies.” In one example, Zuckerberg argued on the stand that Meta’s “growth slowed down dramatically” due to the rise of TikTok. In another comment, he said he thinks “people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently.” The FTC brought in old emails sent by the Meta CEO, and in one message Zuckerberg floated the idea of spinning off Instagram. He wrote at the time, “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway.” Zuckerberg added, “While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” These comments contrast Meta’s extensive efforts to keep its “family of apps” together under one proverbial roof. The FTC brought in other Zuckerberg emails as evidence, including a 2011 message that called Instagram a “large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos” and a 2012 message that critiqued the teams led by Facebook’s chief tech officer at the time, Mike Schroepfer. “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s not exactly killing it,” he added, per a CNN (WBD+0.75%) report. The following year, Facebook’s current chief operating officer, Javier Olivan, shared concerns with Zuckerberg about WhatsApp’s growth. Messages presented in court, according to The Hill, show that Olivan told Zuckerberg that he’d “been thinking hard about this for the past couple of sleepless nights since I am really worried … these guys are the real deal,” he said. Zuckerberg was reportedly worried at the time that WhatsApp could offer features similar to Facebook and “start winning in the U.S. and other markets.” Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and Vanderbilt’s associate dean for research, told Quartz on Thursday: “So far, the government has done a good job using Zuckerberg’s own words against him, and he has done a good job deflecting them to the degree possible.” “But there is only so much Zuckerberg can do now to walk back on what he said then,” Allensworth added. “These are the worst facts of the case from Meta’s perspective, and the government laid some important blows.” Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former chief operating officer, also took the stand this week. There, the FTC confronted Sandberg about a message she sent in 2011, when Google debuted its now-defunct Facebook clone. Remarking on Google+, she reportedly told staffers that “the most important thing to acknowledge is that for the first time we have real competition and consumers have real choice.” About a year later, Sandberg said she “would block Google” from advertising its rival on Facebook, according to court evidence published by Bloomberg. Sandberg argued that these messages weren’t about putting its rivals at a disadvantage. “I said that to rally the troops,” she countered. Lots of interesting bits surfaced this week. In 2022, for example, Zuckerberg floated purging users’ friend lists as a “potentially crazy idea” to breathe some life into Facebook, according to evidence presented in the trial. Zuckerberg reasoned at the time that “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” could reinvigorate engagement on the service, but it never came to pass. In a call to the FTC’s chair Andrew Ferguson, Zuckerberg tried to convince the agency to settle its antitrust case for $450 million — and later $1 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The FTC, meanwhile, was looking for a settlement worth 30 times as much, per the Journal. Going forward, “the big thing I’m looking for is some expert testimony on what is the right way to think about the market here and Meta’s alleged monopoly power,” Allensworth said. “So far, on that front, we only have testimony by executives at Meta and potential other competitor (like YouTube) about their perceptions of whether Meta faces meaningful competition from social media companies that are not ‘personal,’ like TikTok and YouTube.” Allensworth added, “Judges tend to put a lot of stock in expert opinion in antitrust cases, especially when it comes to market definition and monopoly power.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stream ingest data from Kafka to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using custom connectors
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/stream-ingest-data-from-kafka-to-amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-using-custom-connectors/

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by combining the generative AI model’s capabilities with information from external data sources, rather than relying solely on the model’s built-in knowledge. In this post, we showcase the custom data connector capability in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that makes it straightforward to build RAG workflows with custom input data. Through this capability, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports the ingestion of streaming data, which means developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Think of the examples of clickstream data, credit card swipes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, log analysis and commodity prices—where both current data and historical trends are important to make a learned decision. Previously, to feed such critical data inputs, you had to first stage it in a supported data source and then either initiate or schedule a data sync job. Based on the quality and quantity of the data, the time to complete this process varied. With custom data connectors, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage. By avoiding time-consuming full syncs and storage steps, you gain faster access to data, reduced latency, and improved application performance. However, with streaming ingestion using custom connectors, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes such streaming data without using an intermediary data source, making it available almost immediately. This feature chunks and converts input data into embeddings using your chosen Amazon Bedrock model and stores everything in the backend vector database. This automation applies to both newly created and existing databases, streamlining your workflow so you can focus on building AI applications without worrying about orchestrating data chunking, embeddings generation, or vector store provisioning and indexing. Additionally, this feature provides the ability to ingest specific documents from custom data sources, all while reducing latency and alleviating operational costs for intermediary storage. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases allows organizations to build fully managed RAG pipelines by augmenting contextual information from private data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can build applications that are enriched by the context that is received from querying a knowledge base. It enables a faster time to product release by abstracting from the heavy lifting of building pipelines and providing you an out-of-the-box RAG solution, thus reducing the build time for your application. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, which means you can add, update, or delete data in your knowledge base through direct API calls. For this post, we implement a RAG architecture with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using a custom connector and topics built with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for a user who may be interested to understand stock price trends. Amazon MSK is a streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it straightforward to run Apache Kafka applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution enables real-time analysis of customer feedback through vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). The following architecture diagram has two components: Preprocessing streaming data workflow noted in letters on the top of the diagram: Runtime execution during user queries noted in numerals at the bottom of the diagram: The implementation follows these high-level steps: To build a generative AI stock analysis tool with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases custom connector, use instructions in the following sections. To try this architecture, deploy the AWS CloudFormation template from this GitHub repository in your AWS account. This template deploys the following components: In the precreated MSK cluster, the required brokers are deployed ready for use. The next step is to use a SageMaker Studio terminal instance to connect to the MSK cluster and create the test stream topic. In this step, you follow the detailed instructions that are mentioned at Create a topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. The following are the general steps involved: To create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps: Now, using API calls, you configure the consumer Lambda function so it gets triggered as soon as the input Apache Kafka topic receives data. The Apache Kafka consumer Lambda function reads data from the Apache Kafka topic, decodes it, extracts stock price information, and ingests it into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base using the custom connector. Now that the required setup is done, you trigger the workflow by ingesting test data into your Apache Kafka topic hosted with the MSK cluster. For best results, repeat this section by changing the .csv input file to show stock price increase or decrease. If the data ingestion and subsequent processing is successful, navigate to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases data source page to check the uploaded information. Within the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases console, you have access to query the ingested data immediately, as shown in the following screenshot. To do that, select an Amazon Bedrock FM that you have access to. In my case, I chose Amazon Nova Lite 1.0, as shown in the following screenshot. When it’s completed, the question, “How is ZVZZT trending?”, yields the results based on the ingested data. Note how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases shows how it derived the answer, even pointing to the granular data element from its source. To make sure you’re not paying for resources, delete and clean up the resources created. In this post, we showed you how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, through which developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully managed, end-to-end RAG workflows to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company’s data sources. With this capability, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync, and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

Time Published: 2025-04-18T15:16:10Z

By BERNARD CONDON, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Friday, April 18th, 2025 As the Western hemisphere wound down trading activity with the onset of the Easter holidays, crude oil markets have posted an impressive 7% week-on-week rise, with ICE Brent now back at $68 per barrel. New OPEC+ compensation quotas, tighter US sanctions on Iran, and relatively upbeat March macro data have all boosted sentiment in the short term, although further US-China escalation could upend this week’s recovery. US Ratchets Up Pressure on Iran. The Trump Administration issued new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports, including the Shengxing Chemical teapot refinery based in Shandong province for purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, the second Chinese refiner to be hit with direct sanctions. EIA Is Bleeding People After DOGE Check. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is reported to have lost more than 100 employees in the latest round of resignation offers put forward by Elon Musk’s DOGE drive, possibly losing up to 40% of the EIA’s 350 employees, putting data publications at risk. Mauritania Exports Its First Ever Gas Cargo. UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) has finally loaded its first LNG shipment - aboard the British Sponsor LNG carrier - from the 2.3 mtpa Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) facility offshore Mauritania, following a six-week delay to the export terminal’s commissioning. Equinor’s US Wind Ambitions Dissipate. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated a halt to construction of the Empire Wind offshore project developed by Norway’s state oil firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) off the New York Coast, citing insufficient environmental analysis before approval. BlackRock Gets Ready to Buy Up Utilities. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to own major stakes of public utility companies, a joint 2023 motion of 16 Republican-led states decrying its ESG investing demands on utility companies. Bahrain Resumes LNG Imports. Despite being a producer of oil and sharing a huge oil field with Saudi Arabia, the Middle Eastern kingdom of Bahrain is set to resume importing LNG after a five-year hiatus, with a 170,000 m3 cargo from the US Sabine Pass LNG facility moving towards the Arab Gulf. Europe Has Now Only Two Russian Buyers. The Czech Republic has officially halted its imports of Russian crude after the Transalpine pipeline (TAL) from Italy’s Trieste boosted throughput capacity to 900,000 b/d, with Czech refiners now getting all of their oil needs from the seas. Congo Taps Blackwater Know-How. Erik Prince, the founder of private military firm Blackwater, has allegedly signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure the country’s vast metal reserves and reduce cross-border smuggling of commodities amidst ongoing warfare in Eastern Congo. Trading Firms Eye Italian Refinery Sale. Global commodity traders Glencore (LON:GLEN) and Gunvor are considering buying Italy’s API downstream firm, operating two refineries in Ancona and Trecate, totalling 200,000 b/d in capacity, with Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR also keen to purchase the asset. Force Majeure Saps Malaysia’s LNG Supply. Malaysia’s Petronas, operator of the giant 29.3 mtpa Bintulu LNG export terminal, is experiencing production issues due to boiler malfunction, setting a pricing floor for Asia’s JKM gas futures that are set to rebound from their 9-month low of $12 per mmBtu. China Hits New Coal Record. China posted another all-time high in coal production as the March supply totals amounted to 440.6 million tonnes, up 9.6% from a year ago, worsening the country’s coal oversupply and forcing power utilities to cut their coal imports by 6% month-over-month in March. Refiners Flee California Regulatory Hell. US refining giant Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) filed its request to ‘idle, restructure or cease’ operations at its 170,000 b/d Benicia refinery next to San Francisco by April 2026, marking the second refinery closure in California in less than a year amidst rising regulatory costs. America’s Copper Dream Is On. Following years of stalling and controversy, the Trump administration is set to approve a land swap that would pave the way for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and its project partner BHP (NYSE:BHP) to launch one of the world’s largest copper mines, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona. Ukraine Signs Watered-Down Minerals Deal. Ukrainian authorities stated that Kyiv and Washington have signed a memorandum of intent on developing mineral resources in the Eastern European country, aiming for the establishment of a Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with a full deal expected next week.

Title: Damn the tariffs! Full speed ahead on AI!

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:58:35Z

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / APRIL 18 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Seemingly oblivious to the faltering economy, new artificial intelligence models kept coming fast and furious this week, especially from OpenAI — and apparently they’re pretty popular. China’s DeepSeek? Not so much, at least with the U.S. government, as a House committee just labeled it a security threat. In perhaps a sign that its massive funding is burning a hole in its pocket, OpenAI is also looking at creating a social network. Perhaps Sam Altman sees an opening, given that TikTok still faces having to shut down in the U.S. and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to pay off the FTC to drop its antitrust lawsuit this week, which could force it to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But honestly I don’t really get it any more than I get Elon Musk trying to goose Grok by connecting it to X. IPOs surprisingly aren’t quite dead yet, as Figma filed confidentially this week and Kodiak Robotics said it will go public via a SPAC. But with Trump kicking the economy into a ditch, it’s hard to see any kind of IPO revival. Meanwhile, the tariff gyrations caused tech stocks to plunge again Wednesday, and the overall market fell Thursday too. Nvidia is producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips in Arizona with TSMC, and it’s building AI supercomputers in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron — both no doubt in the works for years, even if Trump likely will try to take credit. But that won’t help prevent more troubles from tariffs and other trade limitations, as Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion sales hit from limits on shipping its H20 chip to China. AMD also estimates an $800 million charge from U.S. restrictions on China trade, and ASML missed order expectations amid tariff uncertainty. And surely there’s more trouble coming. No wonder Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just hopped on a plane to China to smooth things over with officials and local customers. Private equity is staying busy as the stock market creates bargains and targets: Elliott Management has bought up $1.5 billion worth of HPE’s stock. Suffice to say, expect some changes ahead for HPE. Meantime, Intel sold 51% of Altera to Silverlake for $3.4 billion, at a valuation of $8.75 billion — a big haircut from its original acquisition price of $16.7 billion. Google lost another antitrust case, this one on its ad tech offering. But Google will appeal and ad tech is 17% of its business, so the previous case declaring Google Search a monopoly, which awaits a judge’s remedies, remains the bigger deal. If government agencies can still work together in this day and age, it’s not a stretch that a deal involving both cases could happen in place of years of further litigation. The critical CVE Program for tracking cybersecurity vulnerabilities got a last-minute funding reprieve, but it never should have come to this. It’s hard not to feel that we’re one more bad decision by the confederacy of clowns away from disaster. Infrastructure is still getting some big fundraises: Hammerspace raised a hefty $100 million for its Linux-powered data management platform. And Auradine nabbed $153 million to develop bitcoin mining and AI networking hardware. Tech earnings season gets underway in earnest next week with SAP, Tesla, IBM, ServiceNow, Check Point Software, Pegasystems, Intel and Alphabet. The results won’t be nearly as interesting as the outlooks, which surely won’t be robust.

Title: The Decline of Outside Magazine Is Also the End of a Vision of the Mountain West

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:51:14Z
Full Content:
Four years ago, Robin Thurston, a new owner of Outside, hosted an introductory meeting with the staff of the magazine. Thurston, a tech entrepreneur and a former semi-professional cyclist, Zoomed in from Boulder, where he lives. Much of the staff gathered in the magazine’s offices, in downtown Santa Fe, eager for a glimpse of their new boss. The feeling in the room was hopeful. Like many media products, the magazine had been struggling. The thick print issues of the nineties, fat with ads for Patagonia and Land Rover, had become notably slimmer. Some employees had been furloughed to cut down on costs, and Outside had developed a reputation for not paying freelancers in a timely manner. But it was still publishing award-winning journalism, and had a solid reputation founded on decades of literary and investigative journalism. Around the industry, investors were buying distressed media companies; as far as new owners went, Thurston seemed like a good fit, the kind of guy who was happy to have a meeting that was also a bike ride—if you could keep up with him. “The guy’s a hammer,” one staffer told me. Thurston had sold his first company, MapMyFitness, to Under Armour, in 2013. By the time he purchased Outside, he had already raised more than a hundred and fifty million dollars from venture-capital firms, including Sequoia Heritage, to create a digital hub for the outdoors. He had bought roughly a dozen titles—Backpacker, SKI, Climbing, and Yoga Journal among them—under the umbrella of Pocket Outdoor Media. Outside, the largest in circulation and in prestige, could be the centerpiece. Thurston told the staff that he was changing the name of the company from Pocket Outdoor Media to Outside Interactive, Inc. It was an encouraging step, one that felt like a true commitment. In February, however, Outside, Inc., announced its third round of layoffs in as many years. Nearly the entire Outside editorial team that was in place at the time of the acquisition has now left, transitioned to non-editorial roles, or been laid off. A handful of full-time staffers edit the website; the print magazine, once a monthly but now a quarterly, has just one full-time dedicated editor. In response to the latest layoffs, a group of thirty-six contributing editors, writers, and photographers—including Tim Cahill, E. Jean Carroll, Ian Frazier, Hampton Sides, and Jimmy Chin—signed a letter requesting that their names be removed from the masthead. Some of the signatories had been around for Outside’s seventeen-year run of National Magazine Award nominations (including three consecutive wins for General Excellence), and the publication of stories that became best-selling books, including “The Perfect Storm” and “Into Thin Air,” and movies, including “Blue Crush.” “Your company now seems intent on destroying what Outside once stood for,” the group wrote in an e-mail, on March 10th. (I have written a handful of pieces for Outside’s website, the most recent of which was published in 2019.) “There is this magazine—or there was this magazine—that was a liberating thing, that had a history, and there were all these people who just cared. They really cared so much about it,” Sides told me. In response, Thurston reiterated the company’s “commitment to meaningful storytelling” amid a “changing media landscape” and “substantial headwinds in the media market that impact advertising, subscription, and e-commerce.” But, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former editors, writers, and executives, most of whom requested anonymity—either because they had signed non-disparagement agreements or they feared retaliation—mismanagement and a number of missteps have made a challenging situation worse. “I think there was a fundamental lack of direction or understanding from the C-suite as to what any of these magazines were, why the audiences cared about them or subscribed, and what it takes to tell a good story,” a former employee told me. (Outside, Inc., disputes a number of characterizations in this article, including the idea that in-depth reporting—which a representative claimed “remains fundamental”—is no longer a priority.) Outside was founded, in 1977, by Jann Wenner, who brought on collaborators who had worked with him at Rolling Stone, which he had co-founded ten years previously; they hoped to capitalize on the growing interest in outdoor activities and adventure travel. At the time, there were other publications focussed on the outdoors—Field & Stream had a circulation of nearly two million—but they tended to be either technical and insidery or scandalous and tabloidy. David Quammen, a prominent contributor to Outside, recalled Cahill, a founding editor, referring to the latter as “Jaguars rip my flesh” stories. The magazine saw itself as literary but not self-serious; if the stereotypical National Geographic story was a walk through the jungle recounted in hushed, awed tones, its Outside equivalent was a little dustier, wilder, and less reverent. “Outside always had the feeling that it was apart from the Washington and New York journalism community—it’s there in the name. It was always westward-leaning—you know, getting outside, getting away from big cities, living your life, environmentalism and conservation,” Sides said. “There was always a contrarian aspect to it.” In 1978, Wenner sold the magazine to Larry Burke, a young man from Chicago who had spent a chunk of his twenties vagabonding around Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Burke eventually moved the magazine’s headquarters from Chicago to Santa Fe, where staffers worked out of an adobe-style building with two wood-burning fireplaces and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The magazine’s remit was broad: writers covered mountaineering and triathletes, rodeo queens and road trips. Outside sent Susan Orlean to Spain to meet with a female matador, and Don Katz to Yorkshire to profile a man who held the world record for keeping a ferret in his pants the longest. Quammen, who wrote Outside’s natural-science column for fifteen years, told me, “I would write an essay about something really kind of fringe, like, What’s the sense of identity of a spoon worm? What are the redeeming merits of a mosquito? You know, various weird shit. And the editors, God bless them, would print the stuff.” Mark Bryant was Outside’s editor-in-chief in the nineties, years that seem golden mostly in retrospect. “The business was hard, the work was hard, but it was more straightforward,” Bryant told me. “We could focus on the business at hand, putting out a great magazine for readers, and not, you know, content bundling and data aggregation.” Baby boomers were discovering an apparently bottomless appetite for outdoor sports and adventure travel. The magazine benefitted from this surge in interest, even as some writers expressed misgivings about it. The article that became “Into Thin Air” was an example of this ambivalence. Bryant assigned Jon Krakauer to cover the rapid commercialization of Mt. Everest expeditions, sending him on a trip led by a guide who had agreed to accept the bulk of his fee in the form of future advertising in the magazine. That guide, Rob Hall, ended up dying on the mountain, along with seven other people. Krakauer, traumatized and exhausted, wrote a seventeen-thousand-word article within weeks. The story was memorably clear on the dangers that accompanied the increasing numbers of amateurs on Mt. Everest; the next year, demand for guided trips was higher than ever. Burke, the owner, was often a source of friction. According to former staffers, he was critical of hippies, dirtbag climbers, environmentalists, and stories about animals. But he was also immensely proud of the magazine. During the nineties, the famously stingy Burke rewarded star writers and editors with all-expenses-paid kayaking trips on the Salmon River. Through the years, Burke received multiple offers to sell Outside, but he was always resistant, even as the rise of the internet began to erode circulation and advertising income. At first, the larger audiences available online, especially through social media, made the trade-offs seem worthwhile. “We in the outdoor media—and the media, generally—were kind of selling our souls to the platforms for the distribution, because it was so easy and so cheap,” Christopher Jerard, an original staff member of Freeskier magazine and the current vice-president of marketing at Outside, Inc., said. “Then—surprise, surprise—they turned the spigot off, and we were left with no owned audiences.” By 2020, a person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission estimated, the print edition of the magazine had roughly half as many pages as a few decades earlier; Burke, nearing his eighties, finally decided to sell. When Pocket Outdoor Media began scooping up titles, many of them were still profitable or breaking even, with committed but declining audiences, according to sources familiar with the acquisitions. But Thurston seemed to have bigger ambitions than running a stable of small magazines that more or less broke even. In his initial meeting, he laid out a vision of Outside, Inc., as a tech-media empire, “the Amazon Prime for the active-life-style participant,” with subscription numbers akin to those of Disney+ or Netflix. Rather than depending on the volatile advertising market, the company would get recurring revenue via a membership program, Outside+, which would provide unlimited access to the magazines’ articles and other perks. Thurston has bought up non-media brands, including Gaia, a mapping app; FinisherPix, a photography service; Inntopia, a travel-booking software; and Trailforks, a trail database. (Last year, Thurston also reacquired MapMyFitness, his first company, from Under Armour.) He estimated that the worldwide audience interested in healthy, active life styles was at least a billion people, and argued that the industry was recession-proof. In the first, flush year of Outside, Inc., the company “was acting like a startup, and spending money like a startup,” a former executive told me. It occupied a new, spacious headquarters, on Pearl Street, Boulder’s main drag. Thurston liked to dream big—instead of, say, fifteen Outside, Inc., podcasts, why not a hundred? After years of operating on a shoestring budget, the abundance felt like a relief. The company implemented diversity goals, cleared years of freelancer debt, and committed to becoming carbon-neutral within five years. Amid an atmosphere of near-zero interest rates, venture-capital investors were drawn to grand plans and messianic visions, both of which Thurston was skilled at providing. If the company could convert ten per cent of the brand’s existing audiences into subscribers, he theorized, that would amount to twenty million members. (By comparison, the Times has nearly eleven million digital subscribers.) That goal was ambitious, Thurston conceded during his initial meeting with Outside staffers, but he did expect that, within four or five years, Outside, Inc., would be making three hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue from digital subscriptions alone. (That’s more than the Washington Post and The Atlantic made, combined, in 2024.) When I spoke to Thurston last month, he reminded me that the world was plagued by chronic disease, a loneliness epidemic, and generalized alienation. “I have a fundamental belief, Rachel, that the outdoors can solve many of these problems,” he told me. “I fundamentally feel like, if we can achieve that at scale, it can have a big impact on what’s happening in the world.” Thurston saw the media brands he acquired as the top of a content funnel, the “first touchpoint with the ecosystem,” as he put it. But, from early on, writing was an uneasy fit with the business plan. “You cannot get a return on a hundred and fifty million dollars from niche media,” Caley Fretz, the former editor of CyclingTips, which Outside, Inc., acquired in 2021, told me. “Once you’ve got Sequoia [Heritage] on board, the incentive is for just an insane level of scale, and the media entities were immediately superfluous. The audiences they had weren’t sizable enough, and the structures they operated under were not scalable. It became very obvious that the traditional journalism and editorial focus was going to have to give way.” According to Thurston, a significant amount of Outside, Inc.,’s daily engagement has been on the mapping apps. In 2022, the company went through two rounds of layoffs and ceased print publications of nearly all of its titles, apart from Outside. Outside had built its reputation on investigations and reported essays, and at first it continued to publish these kinds of stories, both in print and online. Sources said that long-form stories got good traffic, as did deeply reported service pieces, like detailed gear reviews. But in-depth reporting seemed to be less of a priority for Thurston, according to former editorial staffers. (When I asked Thurston if there were stories from the old days of Outside that would fit his vision for the magazine, the only example he could name was the piece that became “Into Thin Air.” “Any that come to mind other than Krakauer?” I asked. There was a long, awkward pause, and then Thurston said that he would think about it.) “I think the crux of the problem is he’s running a media business and he fundamentally doesn’t love media,” Felix Magowan, the founder of Pocket Outdoor Media, said. Last January, Outside published an extensive investigation, by Annette McGivney, into a prominent California climber’s long history of violence and sexual assault. (Later that year, the climber was sentenced to life in prison, for three sexual assaults in Yosemite National Park.) Shortly afterward, editorial staffers were called into a meeting with Heather Dietrick, Outside’s new chief media officer, who had formerly worked at Gawker and the Daily Beast. Dietrick cited the story about the climber, saying that although it was praiseworthy it was an example of the kind of content that Outside should consider moving away from. The company’s mission was to inspire people to go outside; dark and depressing investigative reporting did the exact opposite. (A representative wrote that the magazine aims for “a healthy mix of uplifting, adventure-focused stories and thorough investigative journalism.”) Then, last fall, after a writer on assignment was photographed standing with Tim Walz, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, while wearing a Harris/Walz cap, higher-ups pushed for extra layers of oversight for political content in advance of the election. This contributed to a “chilling” effect, former staffers said. Thurston said that there was never any kind of ban on political content, and pointed to Outside’s coverage of staff cuts in national parks as an example, among others. But former staffers told the Columbia Journalism Review that stories perceived as political were “defanged” or significantly delayed. Thurston seemed caught off guard by the negative reaction on social media to the most recent layoffs, which he characterized as part of a necessary shift in strategy. “To me, it’s kind of, like, adapt or die for every media company,” he told me. A representative from the public-relations team working with the company sent me an article from the Times titled “The Gen X Career Meltdown,” the subhead of which read, “Just when they should be at their peak, experienced workers in creative fields find that their skills are all but obsolete.” “I think you have a lot of passionate and somewhat earnest people,” Michael Roberts, an Outside staffer since 2000 and the company’s current director of strategic initiatives, said. “I do think the nostalgia element of this is a big factor.” These days, he argued, maybe the best way to stoke enthusiasm and capture fleeting attention spans isn’t only through a long article but through a live event, a podcast, or a video. “I think about my own kid—like, is he ever going to read a story like that?” But sources familiar with the company’s operations, including former executives, say that the problems at Outside, Inc., can’t just be chalked up to a changing media landscape. Former employees described Thurston as quick to both embrace and abandon ideas, strong on vision but weak on execution. (For the past three years, the company has not had a chief operating officer.) The new ownership migrated the magazine’s website to a new platform. “We lost all our Google cred, and our traffic just tanked,” a person familiar with operations told me. As the new ownership focussed on its digital strategy, print subscriptions declined by more than seventy per cent, the person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission said. “The people there are just trying to hold on to this thing with their fingernails. On a human-to-human level, it makes you sad, because these are people who care about the outdoors and people who care about publishing, and every resource they have is being systematically dismantled,” a current contributor told me. The membership model hasn’t taken off as planned. Outside+ presently has fewer than a million paid subscribers, and a significant number of these have come via the company’s acquisitions rather than through organic growth. “It’s all been organic shrinkage, actually,” the former executive said. “Where I thought we would be four years ago . . .” Thurston said. “The last four years have not been easy.” In 2022, Outside, Inc., announced the Outerverse, which included an N.F.T. marketplace “committed to promoting wellness, diversity, and sustainability with the help of blockchain technology.” Editors and writers were encouraged to produce stories about the blockchain. When a writer at CyclingTips wrote a lightly skeptical take on N.F.T.s, it was quickly taken down. That June, the company celebrated the launch of the Outerverse with a rooftop Jack Johnson concert in New York. But the project was plagued with technical issues, and only a few hundred of the ten thousand N.F.T.s were sold. That fall, FTX collapsed, and the N.F.T. market cratered. The Outerverse quietly shut down. “It was just the wrong moment,” Thurston said. “But it hasn’t stopped us from taking swings at opportunities.” Even before last month’s layoffs, the optimism of the early post-acquisition months had given way to a grim feeling that Outside, Inc., was struggling, and that the legacy of the acquired media brands hung in the balance. Owing in part to the company’s belt-tightening efforts, Thurston sold Outside’s Santa Fe offices. Before its new owners took possession—they are reportedly transforming the building into a boutique hotel—the old guard convened a hasty goodbye party. The atmosphere, at once debauched and sombre, felt like a wake, one attendee said. Partygoers were given permission to clear out most of the remaining furnishings, including framed prints of famous issues and National Magazine Award statuettes. Speaking with former Outside staffers, I got the sense that their anger was, at least to some extent, a cover for dismay at a more diffuse and painful set of losses, as tech and finance have encroached on the Mountain West: the ski resorts bought up by private equity; the dirtbag climbers priced out of small towns; Bozeman, of all places, becoming the next tech hot spot. “It just seemed like, to a lot of us watching from afar, Is this the way people are now? Is this the way they live their life?” Sides said. Right now, the company’s focus is on the Outside Festival, in Denver, later this spring. More than eighteen thousand tickets were sold for last year’s inaugural event, which was pitched as a cross between TED, South by Southwest, and the Consumer Electronics Show. This year’s events will include bands, a climbing wall, gear booths, and a startup-pitch competition. When Thurston spoke about it, his voice brightened. “It’s not just about the magazine,” he said, sounding suddenly full of enthusiasm for the future. “It’s, like, What are all of these different avenues to inspire people to get outdoors?” ♦

The funds raised will be for its airports business, specifically for the upcoming airport at Navi Mumbai, the first phase of which is scheduled to commence operations in June this year, according to indications given by its airport arm. Sources said that the group was confident that a public issuance of bonds would get strong traction from US investors, a view bolstered by a recent $750 million private bond placement by an Adani group offshore promoter entity that was subscribed by leading investors including the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock. In February, the group had raised $200 million through a private bond placement for its port operations in Australia. The group is now looking for a larger fund raise through a public bond issue, and the indications are that it could be some time in the middle of the year. In February, US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order directing the US Department of Justice to stop prosecuting Americans who had been accused of bribing foreign officials to secure business contracts. More recently the Trump administration indicated it was rolling back enforcement of certain kinds of white-collar crimes including bribery charges. These developments have been seen as benefiting the Adani group, which is facing bribery and securities fraud charges there. Last year group founder Gautam Adani and several other executives were charged by US law enforcement bodies with bribing officials in India to get solar power contracts for Adani Green Energy, which at that time was raising funds in the US. Any public issuance targeting US investors would require registering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also probing the group over the alleged securities fraud. The Navi Mumbai International Airport, in which the Adani group has a 74 per cent stake, will commence operations with one terminal handling 20 million passengers annually. It will be ramped up in phases to reach a passenger-handling capacity of 90 million. Published on April 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: The dollar's sell-off raises concerns that investors are losing trust in the U.S.

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:22:45Z

Watch CBS News April 18, 2025 / 10:22 AM EDT / CBS/AP Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years — a drop that raises concerns investors may be losing confidence in the U.S. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects deeper investment concerns as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. "Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye." The sell-off in the dollar has accompanied turmoil in both the U.S. stock and bond markets, with investors selling off shares and Treasuries amid concerns about the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on corporate growth and investment. The S&P 500 remains 14% lower than its most recent peak in February, placing it in correction territory. "Particularly disturbing is that both U.S. stocks and bonds fall during these periods—a phenomenon common in emerging markets but rare in developed markets and almost never in America," said Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst. "This is an unambiguous signal from traders that trade wars are sharply curtailing the 'exorbitant privilege' the U.S. has enjoyed for the past half-century." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. To be sure, many investors don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. Some experts say the dollar's decline may be due to its overvaluation, rather than any underlying changes in the strength of the U.S. The dollar "has been overvalued for too long," said Eurizon SLJ Capital in a research note. "All over Europe, we have for years been seeing a tsunami of American tourists, because it was cheaper for an American to fly to Europe to ski than to an American resort 2 hours from home ... A correction in the dollar is just and healthy." But even that is concerning enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that "exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a "confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, "It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar's reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. "Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with," says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. "At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. " They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, "If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin." Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren't as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. "The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn't an alternative." Maybe so, but Mr. Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the way he's rolled them out, with numerous halts and delays. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money, experts say. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is "ripping off" America, as Mr. Trump puts it. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Mr. Trump blasted him, saying "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

IBM workers told to come back to the office When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. IBM has reportedly enacted a mass return-to-office policy, mandating US sales staff to work at least three days a week at a client site, flagship office or sales hub. The news comes just days after the company told its US Cloud employees to return to “strategic” locations (company offices) on similar three-day-per-week terms. In the case of IBM’s US Cloud workers, they’ve been given until July 1 to adhere to the new policy. Workers needing to relocate have been cut a little more slack, with until October 1 to find a new home. It’s unclear when the company’s sales staff will need to move by. On the face of it, IBM’s return-to-office policy is on the nicer side for those in favor of remote and hybrid working. Three days has long been the average in a post-pandemic world, however many of IBM’s fellow tech giants, including Amazon, have enacted full-time five-day policies, marking an end to remote working altogether. Across the US, IBM has five flagship offices in New York, Raleigh, Washington DC and San Francisco. The fifth, in Austin, will be open by next year. A further eight sales hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle are also available for in-person work. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! According to an internal memo by Adam Lawrence seen by The Register, Dallas-based Digital Sales workers will be relocated to the new Austin office when it opens in 2026. Lawrence billed the RTO move as a “return to client initiative,” suggesting that sales staff need to be closer to clients to secure sales. Casually referred to as an initialism for ‘I’ve Been Moved’, IBM has a long history of relocating workers, however positions have been relatively stable at the company in the grand scheme of things. Apart from around 1,000 layoffs in August 2024 relating to the closure of a China R&D department, IBM’s only other big job cut was in January 2023, when 3,900 lost their jobs. Only a handful of much smaller reductions have followed since then.

Title: Strange Sell-Off In The Dollar Raises The Specter Of Investors Losing Trust In The US Under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing.

Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation.

Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Title: Watch These AMD Price Levels as Stock Slides Amid New U.S. Rules on Chip Exports to China

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.

Title: Freshman Rep. Suhas Subramanyam Blasts Data Centers While Cashing In on the Tech Companies That Own Them
URL: https://freebeacon.com/democrats/freshman-rep-suhas-subramanyam-blasts-data-centers-while-cashing-in-on-the-tech-companies-that-own-them/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
He's talking tough on big tech—but banking on their servers. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman Democrat who represents Northern Virginia, is sounding the alarm about the large data centers that have cropped up in his district, blasting them as "invasive" pollutants that could attract cyberattacks. Those centers support more than 78,000 jobs in Northern Virginia. And while Subramanyam doesn't want them in his backyard, he owns hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in the companies that own them, records show. Subramanyam is sitting on at least $630,000 worth of stock in companies like Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, with holdings potentially in excess of $1 million, according to congressional financial disclosures. The companies own or provide critical support to a lion's share of the Virginia data centers, which help power the internet by storing user data for some of America's largest companies. Subramanyam's district is home to more data centers than any other in the country—but during a recent committee hearing, he portrayed them as a creeping menace. "They seemed like a great idea at the time ... but our community is paying the price now, and we're a cautionary tale for the rest of the country," Subramanyam said, calling the centers "not great for the communities." "[In]the next five years alone, data centers can increase customers bills by up to $276 a year, and people's utility bills may double in the next 7 to 10 years just to power data centers," Subramanyam said. "And the environmental impact is real as well. These green spaces are disappearing. Pollution is rising and water supplies are being stretched thin. It's making reaching our clean energy goals in Virginia nearly impossible." "And it's also a security risk," the congressman continued, warning that Russia or other malign actors would be tempted to target the data center hub which had emerged in his district. "You just look at the Ukraine war. When Russia failed to hack Ukraine’s telecom networks, what did they target? They targeted the data centers." A combination of factors—including tax incentives, an abundance of skilled labor, good climate, and proximity to cable internet infrastructure—has made Northern Virginia an ideal spot for the tech sector's data centers. Should they move elsewhere, Subramanyam's stock portfolio would likely rebound—and the area he represents would lose some $31 billion in economic output, according to the Northern Virginia Technology Council. Subramanyam specifically holds at least $500,000 in NVIDIA and at least $130,000 more in Amazon and Meta, according to his most recent personal financial disclosures. Amazon alone maintains at least 93 data centers in Northern Virginia, according to DataCenters.com, a third-party monitoring website. Meta's data center in Sandston, Va., occupies 450,000 square feet and cost $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. And while NVIDIA does not own centers outright, they play an integral role in the data center ecosystem. The company's NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program partners with centers by providing coveted certifications guaranteeing they are optimized to handle the various demands and requirements of their parent companies. Rep. Nick Langworthy (R., N.Y.) sent a message to the companies operating data centers in Subramanyam's district. "We need to focus on keeping America competitive and powering our future," he told the Washington Free Beacon. "If Rep. Subramanyam is too foolish to want these great jobs in his district, bring them to mine!" Subramanyam did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: How to Tax-Loss Harvest with Vanguard
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/tax-loss-harvest-vanguard/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T06:30:59Z
Full Content:
When it comes to investing, small optimizations can make a big difference. For example, if you had a $100,000 portfolio, boosting your returns by just 0.1% over 30 years would mean earning an extra $8,221 in returns. Tax-loss harvesting in your taxable brokerage account (if, for instance, you are with Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab) is one way to optimize your investments. It’s an investing/tax reduction strategy that relies on selling losing positions to take advantage of a tax deduction. That means saving money today, giving you the chance to invest even more in the market. Today, let's talk about how to tax-loss harvest at Vanguard, something that could be a good idea for you given the current volatility of the market. It might NOT be a good idea for you, though. And there are certainly plenty of ways to screw it up. Tax-loss harvesting is a process that involves selling poorly performing investments at a loss and then immediately investing the proceeds in a relatively similar but non-identical investment. According to IRS rules, you can report investment losses on your tax return and use those losses to offset gains from the sale of other investments and from ordinary income while still staying in the market with very similar assets. When you sell at a loss, you can report that loss to the IRS on your taxes, using the loss to offset gains from other investments or a portion ($3,000 per year) of your ordinary income for income tax purposes. For example, if you sell one investment for a loss of $13,000 and sell another at a $10,000 profit, you can report a net $0 profit from investments and deduct up to $3,000 from your regular income, a big savings when you’re in a high tax bracket. In a typical physician tax bracket, that's worth about $1,000 in cold hard cash. If you have more losses than $3,000, the loss can be carried over and applied to your future tax bills. More information here: Is Tax-Loss Harvesting Worth It? The Case Against Tax-Loss Harvesting Tax-Loss Harvesting with Fidelity 13 Ways to Screw Up Tax-Loss Harvesting The most important thing to keep in mind with tax-loss harvesting is that you need to avoid a wash sale. A wash sale happens when you sell an investment for a loss and then buy the same or a “substantially identical” security within 30 days of the sale in that same brokerage account, any other brokerage account, or any IRA. If you make a wash sale, you don’t get to report the loss on your tax return, meaning you miss out on the opportunity to reap the tax benefits of tax-loss harvesting. Instead, you should sell your losing position and buy one that’s similar but not identical. For example, if you sold shares in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX), which tracks the S&P 500, and bought shares in the Total Stock Market Fund (VTSAX), which tracks the whole American stock market but has a heavy weighting of stocks in the S&P 500, you wouldn’t trigger a wash sale because the funds are not “substantially identical.” While this isn't particularly watched by the IRS (basically, if the brokerage doesn't report it as a wash sale, nobody seems to care), it is the law, and you should follow it when tax-loss harvesting. “Substantially identical” has never been defined by the IRS, and personally, I think swapping one total stock market fund from two different companies for another is just fine. I'm still waiting (for at least a decade or two) for someone to say the IRS told them differently. More information here: Tax-Loss Harvesting Pairs and Partners In June 2018, when I originally wrote this post, stocks dropped for about six days straight. If you look carefully at the chart, there were similar episodes—at least for international stocks—in February, March, and May as well. If you had purchased an international stock index fund at any point during 2018, chances were very good by June 19 that you had a loss you could tax-loss harvest, especially if you had not already done it earlier in the year. (The really astute investor probably had already done this in February, March, or May.) So, I sent a Tweet out to my Twitter followers: . . . and linked to a blog post I had on tax-loss harvesting (TLHing). I thought it'd be a good idea to document the process of how to tax-loss harvest with Vanguard. Given stock market volatility in early 2025, changes in the IT interface at Vanguard, and the now common use of ETFs, we have also updated this post with even more screenshots. If you’re ready to start tax-loss harvesting with Vanguard, follow these steps. Keep in mind that Vanguard's website has changed since I originally wrote this post. WCI contributor TJ Porter went through the process in 2025 and provided us with updated screenshots, but we still have some original screenshots from 2018 further below in this post. We also have a section on doing this with ETFs from screenshots I just took last week (April 2025) while tax-loss harvesting. Open your brokerage account and navigate to the holdings page. Then, use the dropdown box to show “unrealized gains/losses.” You’ll be given a list of all of your positions and the short- and long-term gains or losses. Porter didn't have much in the way of losses to harvest, but this is what the screen will look like. Even if you have an overall gain, there still may be opportunities for tax-loss harvesting. Click the arrow next to “Show lot details,” and it will display every lot of shares you’ve purchased and the individual gain or loss from that lot. Despite the overall gain, he had a few lots of Disney stock that had long-term capital losses. He could sell those lots to book the loss and then use that money to buy shares in something else. One thing that’s important to note is that Vanguard (and most brokerages) offer three cost basis methods: As a general rule, the best one is Specific Identification, and the worst one is First In, First Out. That's because when you go to tax-loss harvest, you usually want to sell the LAST shares you bought—not the first ones—as the last ones generally have the biggest loss to harvest. Specific ID will let you view the price of individual lots of shares you’ve purchased to lots that are currently at a loss that can be sold for tax-loss harvesting. To do this, you can click the “View/Change cost basis method.” It may take a day for the lot information to become available. Once you’ve identified lots to sell for a loss, you can click the “Transact” button. It will bring you to a page where you can choose to buy or sell shares. You’ll want to choose “Sell.” On the next page, under Cost Basis, select “Specific identification” and then click the “Select Shares” button. You’ll be presented with a page that lets you select which shares to sell. Choose the ones with a loss. Once you’ve sold the shares, you’ve generated your tax loss. You can now reinvest the money in another investment as long as it isn’t substantially identical. To get started, go back to your account homepage and click “Transact” and select “Buy & sell.” On the next page, you can select the type of investment you’d like to buy, enter the ticker symbol, the amount to buy, and the type of order. Once you submit the order, Vanguard will execute the trade and add the new investment to your portfolio. Vanguard is a brokerage that’s very focused on mutual funds. While the above process will work for tax-loss harvesting for mutual funds, you can make the process easier using the “Exchange” option. Open the details page for the mutual fund you want to tax-loss harvest by clicking on its name on your holdings page. Then, click the “Exchange” button. Next, you’ll have to select the shares you wish to sell. After that, click the button to select a fund to buy. You’ll be presented with a list of funds you have already invested in to exchange shares. You can also click “Buy a new fund” and enter the ticker or name of any fund offered by Vanguard. Keep in mind that, if selecting a new fund, you’ll need to meet any minimum investment requirements. Remember, the goal with tax-loss harvesting is to choose something that is highly correlated with the original fund, while not, in the words of the IRS, substantially identical. Once you’ve selected the new fund, click the button to submit the order. Vanguard will sell the shares in one fund and buy shares in the new one. That will generate the tax loss while immediately reinvesting your money. I have encountered at least one WCIer who ran into a problem at Vanguard because they chose to buy and sell the funds in separate transactions one day apart rather than exchange. Exchanging seems to be more reliable, at least at Vanguard. But I had a separate WCIer have the opposite problem at Fidelity while trying to exchange funds from two separate fund providers. More details of those experiences here. You need another example of tax-loss harvesting with index funds? Here's what I did in 2018. Keep in mind that Vanguard's website looks different now, but hopefully, you'll get the point of what I was doing with these old screenshots. As you can see in my case, our VTIAX holding (Total International Stock Market Fund) had a $5,350.52 loss at the beginning of the day. I hit “Exch” for exchange on the right side of the screen for the fund I wanted to exchange because I was going to trade one fund for another. That took me to this screen: It all was bought at a price higher than what it could have been sold for that day, so I chose to sell 100% of it. I was stuck with the FIFO method on the day I made the exchange, which was fine in my case. Next, I needed to choose a fund to exchange into. At Vanguard, the usual first choice for the Total International Stock Market Index Fund is the FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund. Why is that fund such a great TLHing partner? Here's what I researched at the time. As you can see, the performance was nearly identical YTD and over the previous five years. The expenses were identical, and they both invested in “large international blend” stocks. Clearly, the funds had a very high correlation. I should expect nearly identical performance out of them. VFWAX it is. I chose it on the next page. After a couple of submission and confirmation pages, I had officially tax-loss harvested. When I wrote this post in 2018, I tax-loss harvested in my Vanguard account, and I booked an actual loss of $7.689.50 in the 30 seconds it took me to go through the TLHing process. When tax-loss harvesting, up to $3,000 can be applied against your ordinary income, which in my case is taxed at 37% federal + 5% state, or 42%. So, a $3,000 deduction is worth $3,000 * 42% = $1,260 off my tax bill. The remaining loss is carried forward to the next year. Of course, the $3,000 loss is only good if there is $3,000 left AFTER it is applied against all of your short and long-term capital gains on Schedule D. The bottom line is that ONLY the amount of your loss above and beyond your short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains can be applied to your ordinary income and only up to $3,000 per year with the remainder being carried forward to future years. In many people's cases, they won't know exactly how much money they saved by TLHing until they find out what their capital gains are for the year. But even if I had more than $7,689.50 in long-term capital gains distributed from my mutual funds, I would, at a minimum, have saved the taxes on those, which was at 23.6% for us. So, $7,689.50 x 23.6% = $1,815. More likely, $3,000 of it would have gone against my regular income ($1,260 off my tax bill), and $4,690 would have gone against some LTCG distributions ($1,107) for a total of $2,367 off my tax bill. It was certainly worth 30 seconds of my time. The semi-knowledgeable critic might point out that TLHing really only defers paying taxes; it doesn't actually lower them. Let's make that critic more knowledgeable and less critical and point out why TLHing is still a good idea, particularly for me. There are three aspects to consider. The tax savings are very much real to me. Tax-loss harvesting and then flushing the additional gains out of your portfolio through charity (and death) is a very tax-efficient way to invest. A few days after I TLHed (and wrote this post) in 2018, I had the opportunity to do it again and score another $7,800 in tax losses. Both international stocks and US stocks were down for the day, and I had some big red negative numbers when I checked my basis. I sold a couple of lots of my Total Stock Market Index Funds (only two had a loss; the rest still had a gain). I exchanged into the Vanguard Large Cap Index Fund (a bit more like TSM than the 500 Index is). I also sold the FTSE Ex-US Fund that I had just purchased. I exchanged 20% into the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund and 80% into the Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund. At this point, I had booked more than $15,000 in losses to use on my 2018 tax return, which I could really use, given that we took the standard deduction that year after bunching many of our itemized deductions in December 2017. After that, I was done with tax-loss harvesting for the time being. How did I know I was done? Because when I looked at all my tax lots on the “unrealized gains/losses” tab, I saw only green. Nothing was in the red. I don't tend to tax-loss harvest so frenetically anymore, typically not doing it any more often than once every couple of months now for reasons discussed here. But it can be done every day (or even multiple times a day with ETFs) if you want. When buying and selling ETFs, you can't use an “exchange” order. You have to put in a sell order. Then, once it executes, put in a separate buy order. Try not to wait very long between these orders either. You don't want the market to rise in between them. You'll want to use “market orders” as you can't use limit orders with specific identification, and you definitely want to specifically identify which lots you're selling. You're only trying to sell lots with losses here. Let's get to the screenshots. In our example here, I'm selling some lots of VXUS (the Vanguard Total International Stock Market ETF) and buying a single lot of IXUS (the iShares/BlackRock Total International Stock Market ETF). The first step is to check out your cost basis. You do that at Vanguard by logging in, clicking on “Holdings,” and then clicking on “Unrealized gains/losses.” It should look something like this. There are four lots with losses and two more with minimal gains. It doesn't really matter all that much whether losses are short-term or long-term when it comes to how they are used on Schedule D. While there are reasons to wait until gains are long-term before selling, there is no reason to wait until a loss is long-term. I also generally look at the tax-loss harvesting partner's cost basis and purchase dates (and dividend payment dates) to make sure I'm not screwing anything up with wash sales or violating the 60-day rule for qualified dividends. Here is the same shot for the tax-loss harvesting partner, IXUS. As you can see, there were no losses to harvest there and no recent purchases either. Next, I open up another tab, go to Vanguard.com, and click on “Balances.” I scroll down to the account I want to tax-loss harvest in (this is your taxable account, of course; in our case, it's a trust taxable account). Click on the account to expand it. The expanded version should list all of the investments in the account and look something like this: Click on the investment you want to sell, in this case VXUS, and then the three little dots next to transact, and click “Sell.” That will bring you to the trade page, which will look something like this. Note the warning from Vanguard. It's dangerous to wade into volatile markets, but that is also often the time when you can capture the largest tax losses. For reference, this transaction was done the day President Trump announced a 90-day delay in tariff implementation but a couple of hours before the announcement. When markets are volatile, the speed at which you put in the buy order after the sell order executes might really matter. You could lose more by being out of the market than you're gaining by tax-loss harvesting. Now, it's time to put in your order. Note that I have two tabs open right now, both at Vanguard. One is on that page showing me the cost basis, and the other is showing me this trade page. You might even want a third one open on the “order status” page so you can refresh it after putting in your order to make sure it executes. Note the little error notice on this page. In this case, I discovered that Vanguard wouldn't let me sell “partial shares.” Remember those lots with a 13-cent loss and an 88-cent gain? Those are partial share lots from prior reinvested dividends or shares that weren't liquidated after tax-loss harvesting in a previous year. I've since learned my lesson not to buy partial shares. I was wanting to clean those up, but apparently I couldn't because Vanguard doesn't let you sell partial shares until you completely exit an investment (which may very well be literally lifetimes from now in this account). So, I just decided to sell the other three tax lots with losses as well as the one with a minimal gain ($165) just to get rid of that tax lot—the total being 12,251 shares. At first, I thought, “Hey, markets are volatile. I'll use a limit order to make sure nothing crazy happens, I'll just set the limit order far enough below current market price that it'll still execute immediately.” That's when I discovered something else. All of the securities in this account are already set to have “Specific Identification” as their cost basis method. So, why was it asking me to choose a cost basis method? I'd never seen that before. I clicked on it and saw this. Apparently you can only use market orders when you use Specific Identification. I canceled out, went back, and ditched my limit order idea for a simple market order, which is what I usually use with all these extremely liquid ETFs in our portfolio. The trade order now looks like this (ignore the share number, I changed that just after taking the screenshot when I decided to sell that tax lot with the small gain, too): Notice what the button at the bottom now says. It doesn't say “Sell” or anything like that. It says, “Select Shares.” That's EXACTLY what I want to do. I only want to sell the tax lots that have losses, right? After you hit that, you see this: Note that I've just clicked the “All” button for each of the lots I want to sell, and it added up to 12,251 shares. I hit the “Preview order” button at the bottom, and this scary-looking warning popped up. Seems almost nonsensical. But no, I'm not trading this security twice in one day, nor am I choosing the same tax lots to do so. I just clicked “I understand” (that somebody did this once and now you feel a need to scare the rest of us out of doing it). Maybe this is an issue for day traders or something since the tax lot/cost basis screen isn't updated minute by minute throughout the day. The next screen told me the order was submitted. Now it's “Go Time.” I want to get the subsequent buy order in as fast as I can accurately do so because I now have $681,523 out of the market sitting in cash, and I don't want the market to rapidly move upward while it is out. You can take your time with the sell order, but you need to move when it's time to put in the buy order. The next place I go is the “Order Status” page to ensure the order actually executed. If you already have that up in a third tab (it's probably best practice), you can just refresh the page on that tab, and it'll look like this: Note the “Executed” line. That's what you want to see. I've never had an ETF market order that didn't execute immediately, but I suppose it could happen. And just in case you're not aware, you should probably only be trading ETFs while the markets are actually open, which can be a problem if you're at work all the time when markets are open. Depending on how you check on this order, sometimes the page looks like this: Either way, “Executed” is the key. Now it's back to the Holdings page. Find your tax-loss harvesting partner (or choose a new investment if you don't already own some shares of the partner), click on the three dots, and hit “Buy” this time. That'll take you to an order/trade page. In this case, I was buying $682,000 or so worth of IXUS, but I didn't know how many shares that was. There's a handy little calculator on that trade page that can help, though. And seconds could potentially matter here, so I used it. It looks like this: I'd show you what the trade page looks like, but apparently I was in so much of a hurry I didn't bother screenshotting it. It looks like the sell order except it says “Buy,” “IXUS,” and “10,947” shares. Once I hit the “Buy” or “Continue” or whatever it said button, another scary warning popped up. Of course I'm using unsettled funds. I just created those funds 30 seconds ago with the sell transaction, and that transaction won't settle for 1-3 business days. Just remember you can't turn around and sell IXUS an hour later. You're stuck with it until the VXUS sale settles. I hit “Continue,” and I go to the Order Review page. Yup, looks good. That's what I want to do. I hit “Submit order.” Then, it was time to refresh the Order Status page and make sure it went through. Yup, looks good. Looks like it took me less than 4 minutes between the sell order and the buy order. Not a record by any means, but probably fast enough the vast majority of the time to avoid any massive market movement while those dollars were out of the market. A few days later after everything had settled and the website had updated, I checked on the results. Again, go to Holdings, then Realized Gains/Losses, and scroll down to the account you care about, and you can see the results of your tax-loss harvesting. This VXUS →IXUS wasn't the only transaction I did that day, and it wasn't even the only day I did tax-loss harvesting in 2025. This particular transaction was worth a $42,000 loss, and we've booked about $174,000 in losses so far in 2025. If I next go to the Unrealized Gains/Losses page, I can see how this particular new lot has been performing since then. (This screenshot was taken on April 16, seven days later.) After booking that $42,000 loss, this new lot had gained $71,000 in the week after the tax-loss harvesting. This demonstrates why the best method to tax-loss harvest is to swap for another similar fund rather than sitting out of the market in cash for 30 days to avoid a wash sale. You don't want to change your portfolio significantly. You just want to “harvest” a loss to use to reduce future taxes. There is some additional hassle and risk with tax-loss harvesting using ETFs rather than traditional funds, but I do think it's probably best to use ETFs for your stock mutual funds in taxable accounts in most situations. What have we learned about tax-loss harvesting today? Let's list it out: #1 You should do it if you are given the chance. It will save you money. #2 Beware the wash-sale rules. You can't buy back what you just sold in any investing account (including your spouse's) for 30 days. No, you can't buy more shares just before you sell them either. That 30 days goes both forward and backward. #3 Beware the 60-day rule. If you don't own a security for at least 60 days around an ex-div date, you turn that dividend into a non-qualified dividend and pay more tax on it. #4 Don't sweat the substantially identical rules. As long as you're buying a different fund (not a different share class of the same fund), the IRS isn't going to hassle you about it. Buy a fund that is very highly correlated to the original one. Some good examples of TLHing partners for commonly owned Vanguard funds include: Hardcore investing aficionados can argue all day about the merits of one partner over another, but the point is to get something reasonably similar that you are happy to hold forever. Sometimes you do need two or three of them for a single asset class if the market is dropping rapidly and you want to grab every possible loss you can, but you always have the option to just wait 30 days before repurchasing what you sold. Of course, there is a risk there that the market rebounds rapidly and you end up selling low and buying high, so I prefer to exchange to another fund rather than wait. What do you think? Have you tax-loss harvested before? Why or why not? What did you find difficult about it? What recommendations do you have for someone who has never done it before? [This updated post was originally published in 2018.] Hello, thanks for your help. I’m attempting to TLH. I am able to follow the steps as listed except vanguard wont let me actually execute the order. It tells me ‘Your total selected shares must match the amount you’d like to sell.’ Except that I am doing this and the share number I input on the order page does match the number of shares I select on the spec lot page. Any idea what i’m messing up here? ty. No idea. Time to pick up the phone and call them. Thx, yes I did that. Not entirely clear why but when I selected entire lots if they included partial shares it didn’t work. When I only inputed a non-decimal number (whole shares) from a lot it did. For what it’s worth that helped me if anyone else ends up having the same problem. Maybe in the future when I make buys I’ll just do whole shares instead of dollar amounts. To clarify the above, I had the same issue. My brokerage account was holding only VTI. From the time I started investing in VTI, vanguard had started allowing you to purchase partial shares, so 100% of my lots had partial shares, because I would just buy specific dollar amounts (the amount I had available to invest). When the market began dropping a couple weeks ago, I attempted my first stab at tax loss harvesting. Vanguard will not allow you to sell partial shares, so I attempted to sell the the full shares of my tax lots that had losses, believing that vanguard would liquidate the remaining partial shares (as that’s what I had read on bogleheads). I was wrong. The partial shares on my lots with losses remained, which included a wash sale because the partial shares of a recent purchase remained. Well, I called the other day to inquire and it turns out, Vanguard will only liquidate your remaining partial shares if you sell ALL holdings of that ETF. So if I wanted to be able to sell this, I had to sell all the VTI, including those without losses. Luckily the market had dropped so much that I had minimal gains and lots of losses so it was easy to just sell everything. Lesson learned. Don’t buy partial ETF shares because it makes selling them very complicated. I agree with your conclusion and I’m sorry you had to go through this. I don’t do partial shares in taxable accounts. Although I’m not sure I’ve heard of someone running into your particular issue before. At any rate, it can’t be much of a wash sale if it’s only a partial sale. Also, a quick question. If I’ve tax-loss-harvested from VTI to ITOT when the market dropped, then it dropped again, last week I sold everything and moved it to SCHB, but it looks like the market may just continue to go down for a bit and I’d like to capture those losses. Do I just keep going down the line of similar (but not substantially identical) total stock market ETFs? I presume I can’t go back to VTI until 30 days after I last sold it, correct? Thanks, as always, for all you’ve done and all you do. I don’t do frenetic TLHing anymore. You end up with worse and worse options to invest in, you get more frequent wash sales, you start turning qualified dividends into non-qualified dividends, you have more risk of market movement between the trades, you spend more of your hard earned time etc etc etc. More info in this month’s newsletter: https://ckarchive.com/b/p9ueh9h2d67x0sm6ggw6kapnkk733hr So you can if you want, but I don’t. I tax loss harvest no more frequently than every 2 or 3 months. Just wanted to note, I recently set a limit order at Vanguard and, after the trade executed, I had the ability to edit the lot selection from taxmin to specific identification and pick the shares I wanted even though I couldn’t do this when placing the order. Interesting. Glad to hear. Does the amount that was harvested show up on the 1099-R they send at the end of the tax year? Or do we have to keep track of it and put in our Schedule D? It comes on the 1099. I might have to go back to 2022’s to screenshot it though since I don’t think I tax loss harvested at all in 2023 and 2024. Thanks for walking us through tax loss harvesting. I use the Vanguard Personal Advisor Select to manage my investment portfolio. I signed up for their automatic tax loss harvesting program that applies predefined tax loss harvesting matches. . When there is an appreciable drop in one of my funds, it can convert a small portion to one or two equivalent funds to harvest tax losses. At first it was distracting to see it convert total international fund to Europe and Pacific, but these are not large amounts and the automatic program seems to be trimming taxes, especially in my taxable brokerage fund. It converts back to the original fund after the wash sale limit period so there are no long term changes in my mix of funds. The size of the amount shouldn’t be too relevant. Keep in mind that whatever they swap you into you may be stuck with the rest of your life so you need to be okay with holding it. Swapping back to the original fund could generate a large capital gain and wipe out or even more than wipe out your loss. Great refresher article! Does it matter if you TLH short term shares instead of long term? With the market fluctuating at spring 2024 levels, looks like most of the losses are on shares accumulated within the last year..

Title: BlackRockâs Panama port deal stirs debate over Chinese chokehold on strategic shipping routes

US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. President Donald Trump's recent congressional address has thrust the Panama Canal into the spotlight of a new geopolitical contest. Trump highlighted BlackRock's proposed $22 billion acquisition of ports at either end of the Panama Canalâcurrently owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchisonâcalling attention to the strategic risks of foreign control over vital infrastructure. The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints.

Sources for this article include: ZeroHedge.com SupplyChainDive.com NYPost.com The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports.

Posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt Nikita Casap sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, discussing relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. The Wisconsin teen accused of killing his parents to obtain financial means to assassinate President Trump and overthrow the United States government was allegedly working with foreign entities, including someone with a Ukrainian phone number and someone in Russia, according to an FBI affidavit. He also asked his contact who would be blamed for the attack, and was told "Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal." Nikita Casap, 17, of Wisconsin, allegedly sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, who writes in Cyrillic, discussing going into "hiding" before relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison. Additionally, to avoid detection, the instructions advise to not bring a cell phone." In a Telegram chat from January 21, 2025, it was revealed that the goal of the operation was to blame Russia for the assasination. ...more TOPICS: KEYWORDS: assassinationplot; heroofzeeperland; nikitacasap; trump; ukraine; zeeperhero Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-34 next last 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: bitt Wow, what a genius. 2 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:31 PM PDT by yldstrk (Nothing like the truth) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: bitt What was his Reddit/Bluesky handle? 3 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:44 PM PDT by RushIsMyTeddyBear ("Uncle Sugar" is being audited and having an enema.)

Realty firm Prestige Estates Projects Ltd sales bookings rose 48 per cent to nearly Rs 7,000 crore in January-March quarter, but pre-sales declined 19 per cent to over Rs 17,000 crore in the last fiscal. Prestige Estates attributed the fall in annual sales bookings numbers to lower launches of housing projects due to a lack of approvals from development authorities. As a result, the company has failed to achieve the annual sales bookings guidance of Rs 24,000 crore. In a regulatory filing, Bengaluru-based Prestige Estates shared its operational performance for the fourth quarter of the last fiscal and the full 2024-25 financial year. The company’s sales bookings stood at Rs 6,957.4 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal, an increase of 48 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y).

For plotted developments, the average realisation rose to Rs 6,975 per square feet, a 27 per cent increase from the same quarter last year. Prestige Estates said the sales bookings during the 2024-25 fiscal declined 19 per cent to Rs 17,023.1 crore, “reflecting the impact of deferred launches amid approval delays”. Sales volume for 2024-25 stood at 12.58 million square feet, down 38 per cent Y-o-Y. Total units sold across FY25 stood at 5,919.

Plot sale realisation increased to Rs 7,167 per square foot, registering a 50 per cent Y-o-Y growth. Irfan Razack, Chairman and Managing Director of Prestige Group, said, “FY25 brought with it a mix of achievements and challenges. Despite delays in project approvals that deferred a few key launches into the next fiscal, the final quarter saw strong traction in sales and an encouraging uptick in realisations. “ The appetite for quality real estate remains robust, as evidenced by the outstanding response to the company’s recent launches, he added. “Our focus on customer-centric offerings and premium positioning has also translated into meaningful growth in per square foot realisations. FY26 is set to be a defining year for Prestige Group as we expand into newer markets, launching marquee projects in NCR and Mumbai and achieving our maiden residential completions in Mumbai,” Razack said. “With approvals progressing and the demand environment holding steady, we are optimistic about scaling new heights in the coming year and deepening our presence across key geographies,” Razack said.

Raghavan said the company continues to invest strongly in digital, AI and Gen AI technologies across verticals. “Over 70 per cent of our talent base is now AI ready, and we have built a pool of over 500 specialists across domains and application areas. “We enter the new financial year with the foundation for stability and long-term growth laid by the large deal wins, the continued confidence of our customers across the world, a strong deal pipeline and our differentiated design-led proposition for innovation and product engineering,” he said. As part of the deal, Tata Elxsi will establish a dedicated global engineering centre focused on SDV platforms, electrification, body and chassis, and cloud-native development. The board of directors recommended a final dividend of Rs 75 per equity share of par value of Rs 10 each for FY25.

WWD Beauty Inc's annual ranking of the world's largest beauty companies by sales. Speed and agility were the buzzwords of 2024, so it’s apropos that beauty sales broke the $250 billion barrier for the first time last year. But there are clouds on the horizon. What’s clear from the 2024 WWD Beauty Inc Top 100, our annual ranking of the world’s largest beauty companies by sales, is that the industry is undergoing seismic shifts as a result of geopolitical tensions, technological advances and a consumer landscape that is more complex than ever before. The good news is that total sales hit $252.09 billion. But that represented an increase of just 2.8 percent year-over-year, almost half that of 2023’s 5.3 percent gain. The ongoing slowdown in China weighed heavily on sales, and corporate restructuring was in the cards for a number of players as they sought to derisk and home in on high-potential categories. L’Oréal accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales, its share of the Top 100 inching up once more, by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, up from 14.7 percent in 2019. The top 10 companies overall generated sales of $147.49 billion, or 58.5 percent of total Top 100 revenues, down 0.9 percentage points. Despite the year’s challenges, the vast majority — 73 percent — of companies saw their sales increase, but only 29 saw double-digit gains, down from 37 a year earlier, a sign of slower growth on the market overall. Of the 17 players with negative sales progression, seven were down more than 10 percent and three posted declines of more than 20 percent. Among the biggest winners: Spain’s Puig entered the top 10 for the first time, up four places on a year ago, driven by strong growth in fragrance and skin care. L’Occitane, buoyed by the year’s viral hit Sol de Janeiro, climbed two places to number 18. While times were tough for a number of C-beauty players, the biggest Chinese company on the list, Proya, jumped eight spots to number 28, the first C-beauty firm to reach the Top 30 global beauty companies. With social-savvy affordable makeup players still trending as consumers feel the pinch, despite weakness in mass overall, especially in the U.S., beauty got two new billionaire brands, with E.l.f Beauty and Cosnova both surpassing that milestone in dollar terms. This year’s newcomers include D&G Beauty, which has seen its sales explode since it took its beauty license, previously held by Shiseido, back in-house; Chinese makeup artist brand Mao Geping, which went public in Hong Kong; Auréa Group, the new owner seeking to turn around The Body Shop; Shein, which is flying high with in-house brand Sheglam, and AS Beauty, which bought Bliss World from L Catterton and has successfully rejuvenated the Laura Geller makeup brand. But it was a rough ride for beauty on the stock market in 2024. Of the 49 listed players tracked in our By the Numbers section, only 15 saw their share prices increase through the year, with Victoria’s Secret & Co. the biggest gainer as the market reacted to its turnaround efforts. Of the 29 public players whose share value fell, 21 were down in the double digits, and five of the biggest decliners — Nu Skin Enterprises, Yunnan Botanee, Olaplex, The Estée Lauder Cos. and Shiseido — were already on the wane a year ago, with their market value falling further in 2024. The WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranks the world’s largest beauty manufacturers. Firms are arranged by their beauty sales for the 2024 calendar year. For those companies whose fiscal year did not run from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, estimates were calculated. All sales figures were either obtained from the companies or generated with the help of industry sources, indicated by (EST.) in the ranking. For this list, “beauty” includes fragrance, makeup, skin care, body care, sun care, hair care, deodorant, plus cellulite and shaving products. It does not include bar soaps, razors, toothpastes, food and diet foods, medicines, vitamins, detergents or appliances. The revenues only include sales of beauty products each firm owns or manufactures and do not include business from private-label lines produced for other brands or products distributed for other companies. Information in the main brands section reflects company holdings in 2024. Year-over-year percentage changes are in reported terms, not on a like-for- like or constant-currency basis, unless specified. Non-U.S.-based firms’ sales are converted into dollars according to the 2024 average yearly exchange rate.* Sales figures in non-U.S. currencies were converted to the dollar using the following 2024 average exchange rates from Oanda.com: €1=$1.08190 ¥1=$0.00660898£1=$1.277951 KRW=$0.000733035 R$1=$0.186202CNY 1=$0.1390721 Rupee=$0.0119508 SFr=$1.136091 HK$=$0.1281551 Mexican peso=$0.0548935 Clichy, France2024 Beauty Sales:$47.04 Billion€43.48 Billion+5.6% VS. 2023 Despite continuing to outperform the market as a whole, beauty’s biggest player was not immune to the market’s challenges in 2024. The company described the year as “a tale of two halves,” with a strong first six months followed by weakness in the latter part of the year due to the global slowdown and ongoing challenges in China. Had it not been for the North Asia region, its sales would have advanced in the high single digits, it said. London2024 Beauty Sales:$26.63 Billion (EST.)€24.61 Billion (EST.)+1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) The upheaval at Unilever continues. 2024 was a year dedicated to slimming down and streamlining its operating structure under CEO Hein Schumacher, who joined the company in July 2023 and implemented a major reset in October that year. The news this February that Schumacher would step down in March by mutual agreement took the market by surprise, particularly as he had been praised for his strategy, which the company has said is beginning to bear fruit. CFO Fernando Fernandez — Unilever’s head of Beauty & Wellbeing until 2023 — was named CEO. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$15.2 Billion (EST.)FLAT VS. 2023 With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Cincinnati2024 Beauty Sales:$15 Billion (EST.)FLAT VS. 2023 (EST.) Continued economic and geo-political headwinds, particularly in China, weighed on results for Procter & Gamble’s beauty activity last year. On an organic basis, the firm’s beauty business delivered sales growth of 2%, with slight gains across most brands and geographies. Paris2024 Beauty Sales:$9.11 Billion (EST.)€8.42 Billion (EST.)+2% VS. 2023 LVMH attributed its slight growth in beauty once again to a combination of innovation and its selective retail strategy. As with its competitors, the ongoing slowdown in China appears to have weighed on growth, with Asia (outside Japan) shrinking its weight in the company’s beauty business for the fifth year in a row, down to 30% last year, compared with 33% a year earlier and as much as 45% in 2020. London2024 Beauty Sales:$8.54 Billion (EST.)€7.89 Billion (EST.)+2.6% VS. 2023 With its fragrance business flat, Chanel’s other beauty axes drove business, with makeup the main contributor to its slight uptick in estimated beauty revenues. Sales grew in all markets except the U.S., and Chanel’s performance in travel retail was solid, recovering in most regions but remaining slightly below 2019 levels in North Asia. Hamburg, Germany2024 Beauty Sales:$8.53 Billion (EST.)€7.88 Billion (EST.)+4.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another strong year for the skin care specialist, which CEO Vincent Warnery said was “the best performing skin care company globally” for the second year in a row. Bolstered by strong business from Nivea and the ongoing growth of its Derma brands, especially Eucerin, the German company was on a roll. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$6.55 Billion (EST.)¥990.59 Billion (EST.)+1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) While Shiseido’s sales were relatively stable in 2024, boosted by an uptick on the domestic market, its operating profit tanked, falling 73.1% with the continuing deceleration in China and duty-free weighing heavily on its results. Amsterdam2024 Beauty Sales:$6.1 Billion (EST.)+1.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The fragrance effect was alive and well at Coty in 2024, although its most recent set of earnings showed this was not enough to offset pressures from weak demand in Asia and tight inventory in the U.S. in the latter part of the calendar year, weighing on numbers. Barcelona2024 Beauty Sales:$4.79 Billion (EST.)€4.43 Billion (EST.)+12% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was a big year for Spain’s Puig as it made its stock market debut, further bolstered its portfolio and celebrated its 110th anniversary and listing with a new visual identity. The company outperformed both the premium beauty market and its own midterm revenue guidance for the year, and growth was weighted strongly in the second half. Addison, TX2024 Beauty Sales:$4.6 Billion (EST.)+7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The world’s number-one direct seller of skin care and makeup, per Euromonitor data, Mary Kay broadened its reach to a younger audience with the launch of Mary Kay Skin Care, formulated for those not ready for age-defying products, composed of two regimens, Hydrating and Mattifying. Columbus, Ohio2024 Beauty Sales:$4.58 Billion (EST.)+0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Bath & Body Works spent 2024 building momentum. It maintained market leadership and unit market share in the U.S. body care, home fragrance and soaps and sanitizers segments in 2024, and continued to drive growth in adjacent areas like men’s, laundry, lip and hair care. São Paulo2024 Beauty Sales:$4.49 Billion (EST.)R$24.09 Billion (EST.)-24.4% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another complex year for the Brazilian beauty heavyweight. Following the sale of Aēsop to L’Oréal and the divestment of The Body Shop in 2023 as it sought to simplify its operations and reduce debt, Natura announced early in 2024 that it was looking at options to spin off Avon, whose operations it had acquired outside North America (that activity is owned by South Korea’s LG H&H) in 2020. Düsseldorf2024 Beauty Sales:$4.24 Billion (EST.)€3.92 Billion (EST.)+3.9% VS. 2023 (EST.) Henkel continued to rationalize its portfolio and boost the momentum behind its biggest brands and categories through 2024. It said the strategy, which has seen the company shed businesses in its Consumer Brands portfolio representing around €1 billion in revenues since 2022, is beginning to bear fruit, notably in the hair care category, where the rationalization is more advanced than in other segments. In beauty, following the 2023 disposal of skin care brand Diadermine, it quietly sold off natural skin care label N.A.E. to Katjes International last year. Skillman, N.J.2024 Beauty Sales:$4.2 Billion (EST.)-3% VS. 2023 (EST.) As Kenvue finds its footing out from under Johnson & Johnson and onto the public market, its skin care activity felt the impact of the declining mass market in the U.S. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$4.14 Billion (EST.)¥625.7 Billion (EST.)+5.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) As it sought to seize opportunities outside Asia and dynamize key brands, 2024 was a year of change for Kao as it continued to implement its “Global Sharp Top” strategy introduced in 2023. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$3.6 Billion (EST.)-2.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) Sales slowed for Colgate-Palmolive’s beauty activity last year, according to estimates.

Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland2024 Beauty Sales:$3.14 Billion (EST.)€2.9 Billion (EST.)+18.9% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Seoul2024 Beauty Sales:$3.02 Billion (EST.)KRW 4.12 Trillion (EST.)+6.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Amorepacific’s turnaround efforts began to bear fruit last year, helped especially by strong growth outside Asia. Its revenues in the Americas surpassed those in Greater China for the first time in the group’s history. The integration of sensitive skin care brand Cosrx starting in the second quarter contributed to growth, especially in the EMEA region. Laneige, Hera, Aestura, Illiyoon and Labo-H also performed well, with strong sales in multibrand retail and online. Seoul2024 Beauty Sales:$2.9 Billion (EST.)KRW 3.95 Trillion (EST.)+0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Murphy was appointed to oversee the company as executive chair. Young-Scrivner, who is understood to have resigned for personal reasons, helmed the company for four years, taking on the role at the newly formed company when Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts acquired a 60% stake in it from Coty Inc. She helped Wella navigate the pandemic and oversaw the acquisition of Briogeo. Tokyo2024 Beauty Sales:$2.13 Billion (EST.)¥322.76 Billion (EST.)+7.4% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Neuilly-sur-Seine, France2024 Beauty Sales:$2.06 Billion (EST.)€1.9 Billion (EST.)+2.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) Strong growth in the U.S. and in mainland China, where Groupe Clarins’ sales gained 16% and 8% respectively in 2024, were the biggest drivers for the family-owned firm, which outperformed the market in both countries. It also did well in the U.K. and Italy. Makeup continued to be a source of growth, with key launches including Lip Oil Balm. Once again, the firm’s direct-to-consumer business outperformed sales to third-party sellers, which were up 3% like-for-like. New York2024 Beauty Sales:$2 Billion (EST.)-3% VS. 2023 (EST.)

Title: 2024 Top 100: Growing Pains Hamper The Estée Lauder Cos.

Full Content:
From an about-face on Amazon to a reset C-suite, the company was largely flat year-over-year. Senior Editor, Beauty With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Other changes included Tracey T. Travis stepping down as CFO, replaced by Akhil Shrivastava. The changes continued into 2025 under de La Faverie’s leadership, with Peter Jueptner, Estée Lauder group president, international, leaving, followed by a plethora of moves to its international leadership. Related Articles Fragrance EXCLUSIVE: Kering Beauté Names New CEO at Creed Skin Care EXCLUSIVE: Estée Lauder Focuses on Beauty Rest With Appointment of First Global Sleep Adviser, Dr. Matthew Walker On the brand level, Jane Hertzmark Hudis will take on the new title of executive vice president, chief brand officer, reporting directly to de La Faverie. The company’s 24 brands will now be organized by category clusters reporting to Hudis, with the hope being that this will break down silos and accelerate speed-to-market innovations. Much of the leadership reshuffling involves the elevation of internal executives, many of whom had joined the company in the last few years. Last June, Frédéric Malle announced plans to leave his eponymous niche fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. As for the board, Ronald S. Lauder, a son of founder Estée, retired and handed one of his seats to his son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer, who is married to Aerin Lauder. Most recently, the company expanded the number of layoffs it needs to make from the 3,000 announced in 2024 to as many as 7,000 as part of its Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. It was also reported that Lauder had hired consultancy Evercore to assess its current brand portfolio, with continued speculation that it could look at divestments. Throughout 2024, weak demand in China and Asia travel retail continued to weigh on Lauder, while cracks started to appear in its home market. As a result, the company pulled its full year 2025 outlook in October due to continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As of press time, it had not issued a new one. While analysts believe some impactive factors are out of Lauder’s control, de La Faverie is betting on his Beauty Reimagined strategy to “restore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years,” he said in a release. Key to his vision is expanding into high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to participate in key growth opportunities in prestige beauty. Over the last nine months, for example, key brands like Estée Lauder, Clinique and The Ordinary have launched on Amazon, while in Europe, the company is eager to leverage the strength of its skin care category in the pharmacy channel, for one. Per the company, the move to Amazon appears to have been so far successful. As for launches, Balmain debuted Les Éternels de Balmain, a collection of eight fragrances, produced under license by the Estée Lauder Cos. Deciem, the incubator and parent company of The Ordinary — which closed its $1.7 billion deal with parent The Estée Lauder Cos. in 2024 — debuted Loopha, a body care brand with two products, hand and body washes. Other key launches included La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty’s Runway Lip Color, with the help of its first ever celebrity face, Angelina Jolie. Also during 2024, Clinique made a philanthropic commitment of $5 million over seven years to establish the Mount Sinai-Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Centre with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. It will study skin aging, skin allergies and inflammatory eczematous skin conditions. Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Title: Watch These Netflix Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Strong Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-netflix-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-strong-earnings-11717678
Time Published: 2025-04-18T03:27:15Z
Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped in extended trading Thursday after the streaming giant posted first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher subscription prices and ad revenues. Through Thursday's close, Netflix shares have gained 9% since the start of the year and trade nearly 60% higher over the past 12 months as the company continues to grow its advertising sales and live events content. Analysts have also touted Netflix’s ability to withstand an economic downturn amid uncertainty related to tariffs, with JPMorgan describing it as the “most resilient” company it tracks. Netflix has also attracted attention for its attempt to double its revenue and achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, which the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Below, we take a closer look at Netflix’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching. After setting their record high in February, Netflix shares retraced as much as 23% before bulls stepped in to support the stock last week near the 50-week moving average. It’s worth noting that the rebound coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving higher from the 50 threshold, a reading that has marked the bottom of several prior pullbacks in the stock since early 2023. More recently, the shares continued to gain momentum leading into the streamer’s quarterly results, with the price set to open around the psychological $1,000 level on Monday morning. (U.S. markets are closed Friday in commemoration of Good Friday.) Let’s identify two key overhead areas on Netflix’s chart that investors may be watching and also point out important support levels to monitor during retracements. Netflix shares rose 3.5% to around $1,007 in after-hours trading Thursday. The first overhead area to keep tabs on sits at $1,065. Investors who bought shares during the pullback could decide to place sell orders near the stock’s all-time high (ATH). We can project an upside target to watch above the ATH by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the tool to Netflix’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the stock’s trend higher from August to December last year and overlay them from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $1,300, about 34% above Thursday’s closing price. The earlier trend played out over 17 weeks before the stock consolidated, indicating a similar trending move may last until early August if price action rhymes. During retracements, investors should keep track of the $821 level. A retest of this area could see investors seek entry points near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with the end of a five-week losing streak in early January. Finally, selling below this level sets the stage for a possible fall to around $697. Netflix shares could encounter support in this region near last year’s prominent July swing high and a period of sideways drift on the chart between mid-August and late September.

Theories: I don’t actually think it’s pressure from AI from China or whatever,,, rather, kind of a sea change. Corporation that just has its life blood and advertising, in today’s brave New World I don’t think we’ll be profitable. Unless Google basics and bitcoin somewhere, the future of Google is bleak. assuming that there’s no turning back the clocks of time, that the tariffs against China will be semi permanent, then the big issue: Less advertising revenue because your people will be promoting their products because once again, all the production is made in China. Key Points Reasons for the Stock Decline Google’s stock, under Alphabet Inc., has seen a significant drop due to several interconnected factors. Here’s a breakdown for clarity: These factors have collectively eroded investor confidence, though Alphabet’s long-term position in tech remains robust. Detailed Analysis and Survey Note Google’s stock, represented by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), has experienced a notable decline, reflecting a complex interplay of financial, legal, and market dynamics as of April 17, 2025. This analysis synthesizes information from multiple reputable sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving this downturn, offering insights for investors and stakeholders. Financial Performance and Investor Reactions Alphabet’s recent financial performance has been a significant contributor to the stock’s decline. The company’s Q4 earnings, released earlier this year, reported sales of $96.5 billion, falling short of the consensus estimate of $96.6 billion, despite earnings per share of $2.15 exceeding expectations of $2.13 Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. This revenue miss, coupled with weaker-than-expected cloud growth at 30% year-over-year compared to analyst forecasts, led to a 7% stock plunge post-announcement. The cloud segment, a critical growth area, underperformed, raising concerns among investors about Alphabet’s ability to meet growth targets Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Further exacerbating investor unease is Alphabet’s aggressive capital expenditure plan. The company announced a $75 billion investment for the year, $15 billion more than Wall Street anticipated, with a significant portion allocated to AI infrastructure expansion. This high spending, while aimed at meeting demand, has raised questions about the return on investment (ROI), especially as analysts like UBS lowered their price target from $211 to $191, and JPMorgan adjusted theirs from $232 to $220, suggesting investors may need to wait for AI initiatives to pay off Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Bank of America, however, maintained a “buy” rating with a $225 target, suggesting potential benefits from AI overviews for search monetization in 2025, indicating a split in analyst sentiment. Legal and Regulatory Challenges Legal challenges have added significant pressure on Alphabet’s stock. On a recent Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google created a monopoly controlling parts of the online-advertising industry, marking the second time in eight months the company has been labeled an illegal monopolist Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly. This ruling could lead to the Justice Department seeking forced sales of some of Google’s advertising products, a move that could disrupt its core revenue streams. Additionally, ongoing antitrust cases, including allegations of monopolizing general search services, have contributed to a lower valuation multiple compared to peers like Amazon (38x forward earnings) and Microsoft (32x forward earnings) Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. These legal overhangs have weighed heavily on investor sentiment, with proposals like selling key assets such as Chrome and potentially Android further fueling uncertainty Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly. Competitive Landscape and Market Dynamics Competition from emerging players, particularly in the AI space, has also impacted Alphabet’s stock. A notable example is DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup claiming to develop a rival AI model at a fraction of the cost, raising concerns about the efficiency and competitiveness of American firms’ AI spending Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. This competition, combined with Meta’s perceived clearer ROI path through advertising with its $60-65 billion investment, has led to unfavorable comparisons for Alphabet, further pressuring its stock Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet’s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off. Broader market dynamics have also played a role. Alphabet has been caught in a tech sell-off, losing over $500 billion in market cap, dropping its valuation from over $2.5 trillion to $2 trillion in recent weeks Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap. The Nasdaq Composite, tech-heavy and indicative of sector trends, entered a correction with a nearly 13% decline over 13 trading sessions, reflecting investor unease over factors like Trump’s tariffs and AI spending Yahoo Finance: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Latest Stock News & Headlines. Despite these challenges, some analysts see Alphabet as undervalued at current prices, with a valuation estimate of $200 per share based on 22x expected 2025 earnings of $9.07, compared to its historical average P/E of 18x Forbes: What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?. Investor Sentiment and Long-Term Outlook The combination of these factors has created significant investor uncertainty, with the stock experiencing its largest single-day decline in value, erasing up to $211 billion in market value on February 5, 2025, following the earnings report Times of India: Google loses $200 billion-plus in market value; biggest-ever single-day decline. Despite this, some analysts argue that Alphabet remains a solid buy, given its better finances compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks, though caution is advised due to the ongoing challenges Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap. In summary, the decline in Google’s stock is driven by a mix of internal financial decisions, legal battles, competitive pressures, and external market conditions. While short-term volatility is evident, Alphabet’s long-term prospects in the tech industry, particularly in AI and cloud computing, remain strong, though investors are currently focused on navigating the uncertainties outlined above. Summary Table of Key Factors This table encapsulates the multifaceted reasons behind the stock’s decline, providing a structured overview for stakeholders.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Visits Beijing Amid Tightened Chip Export Control

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is walking a delicate line. Like other major tech companies, the chip giant is currying favor with the Trump administration by making massive investments in U.S. infrastructure. At the same time, Nvidia is trying to preserve its lucrative ties to international markets like China, as evidenced by Huang’s latest visit to Beijing. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A day after Nvidia said it will take a $5.5 billion quarterly hit from new U.S. export license requirements affecting its H20 GPU—designed specifically for the Chinese market—Huang arrived in Beijing today (April 17) to meet with local official and tech leaders, including DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang. During a meeting with Hongbin Ren, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which invited Huang, the Nvidia CEO expressed hopes for continued cooperation with Beijing and emphasized the importance of China to Nvidia’s business, according to local media reports. The visit comes at a particularly tense moment in U.S.-China relations, as both countries remain locked in an escalating trade war. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump enacted 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with a 125 percent levy on American goods. The Trump administration also recently announced new curbs that will require export licenses for semiconductors shipped to China. In an SEC filing this week, Nvidia said the license requirement would cost the company $5.5 billion in additional charges, which will be reflected in its first-quarter earnings report on May 28. In response to earlier restrictions under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, which prohibited the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, Nvidia developed the H20 chip to comply with the new rules. Last year, China accounted for approximately 13 percent of Nvidia’s global revenue. The news license requirement will also affect AMD’s MI308 chips and could cost the company up to $800 million. On April 14, Nvidia pledged to invest up to $500 billion over the next four decades to produce chips in the U.S. The Trump administration hailed the announcement as evidence of “the Trump effect in action,” aligning with the President’s agenda to strengthen domestic manufacturing. Other tech giants like OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) have also made similar investments in recent weeks. Huang’s pledge doesn’t mean he has quite given up on China. In addition to his meeting with Ren, he reportedly met with Lifeng He, China’s vice premier for economic policy, who reiterated the country’s openness to foreign investment and trade partnerships. Huang also met with DeepSeek’s Wenfeng Liang to discuss next-generation chip designs that meet U.S. regulatory standards, according to the Financial Times. DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley earlier this year by unveiling a pair of A.I. models that rivaled the performance of leading U.S. systems—despite being developed at a fraction of the cost. The surprise launch prompted renewed calls from American tech leaders for stricter export controls to slow China’s momentum in A.I.

April 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Merck on February 12, 2025 with a Class Period from February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Merck have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. If you are a long-term stockholder of Merck, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Mumbai: Ahmedabad-headquartered Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said Thursday that it will buy a port terminal in Australia’s Queensland from a promoter company in a non-cash deal that values the 50-million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) capacity asset at an enterprise value of A$3,975 million (approximately ₹21,640 crore or $2.5 billion). The Adanis’ flagship port company will issue 143.8 million equity shares to Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (CRPSHPL). CRPSHPL is a promoter-owned entity that ultimately owns the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT). The transaction will see promoter shareholding in APSEZ go up by 2.13 percentage points to 68.02%. APSEZ had first purchased the port terminal in 2011 for about ₹9,000 crore, as per news reports. However, the asset was sold to the Adani family in 2013 to manage the debt of the listed company. Also read | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds “NQXT’s acquisition is a pivotal step in our international strategy, opening new export markets and securing long-term contracts with valued users,” Ashwani Gupta, whole-time director & CEO, APSEZ, said in a press statement. The terminal is strategically located on the East-West trade corridor, he said. The company is aiming to grow the Ebitda from the asset to A$400 million (about $255 million) in four years, Gupta further said. It recorded an Ebitda of A$ 228 million in FY25. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The terminal has a rated capacity of 50 MTPA and the company estimates that the capacity can be ramped up to 120 MTPA as demand grows. In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the terminal handled 35 million metric tonnes of cargo, the company said. As part of the transaction, APSEZ will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities associated with the terminal. However, APSEZ’s leverage will remain at similar levels post the transaction, the company said. Read this | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever NQXT is a natural deep-water, multi-user export terminal at the Port of Abbot Point, approximately 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government till the year 2110. The terminal has a “high quality customer base” operating in the Bowen and Galilee mining basins. These mining companies export metallurgical and energy coal to over 15 countries from NQXT. APSEZ is India’s largest commercial ports operator, and accounts for almost one-fourth of the cargo movement in the country. The expansion is part of APSEZ’s stated goal of handling 1 billion tonnes per annum capacity by 2030. It handled 450 million tonnes in FY25, as per an investor presentation. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹26,711 crore in FY24, and net profit of ₹8,104 crore, per data from the BSE. The company's shares closed 2.2% higher at ₹1,259.90 on the BSE on Thursday.

Title: ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman Derisks, Says Stock Market Volatility Will Be Here for a While

Steve Eisman says he’s taking a wait-and-see approach to the stock market right now. In a new interview with CNBC, the famous investor notes he’s dialed down the risk in his personal portfolio. “I’m waiting. I think we’re going to have volatility for quite a while. The Trump Administration has set up a situation where they’re going to be negotiating with multiple countries on multiple issues. It’s not going to take a couple of weeks, it’s going to take a few months, so I think, for the time being, volatility’s going to be here for a while.” Eisman, who’s known primarily for betting against the housing market prior to the American subprime mortgage crisis, says stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apollo Global Management (APO) have “strong long-term fundamentals” and are primed to make investors money over multi-year timeframes, though he’s less certain about the shorter term. “I would not even hazard a guess as to what any stock will do over the next few months, simply because we’re in the type of market where… there’s only one variable that matters, and right now the variable that matters is the president of the United States, and I can’t handicap that right now.” In terms of NVIDIA specifically, the famed investor says it’s only “the early innings of the AI revolution,” and he predicts the tech giant still has room to grow.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump
URL: https://www.clickondetroit.com/business/2025/04/17/strange-sell-off-in-the-dollar-raises-the-specter-of-investors-losing-trust-in-the-us-under-trump/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T23:25:05Z
Full Content:
Bernard Condon Associated Press Published: April 17, 2025 at 7:25 PM Updated: April 18, 2025 at 3:26 PM Bernard Condon Associated Press NEW YORK – Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. Recommended Videos The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost."

Title: The rise and wobble of India's EV pioneer Ola
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15vgegl7pjo
Time Published: 2025-04-17T21:49:07Z

It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises. Founded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way. The company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn. Marquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (£567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. But this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm. Ola Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny. Sales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride. There's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled. The BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them. Ola has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed. The BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries. So, what's gone wrong? Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market. He poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings. But Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. Its scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. Several former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. In response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the "myth" that the vehicle had "not been engineered and tested for India". It said it had "fully re-engineered" Etergo's scooter and tested it for "Indian conditions". "The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests," it said in the post. But several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions. Some scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. Ola recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires. Some riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. In early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. The front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use. Meanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company. Their entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. Ola aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries. Government data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year. But competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital. To push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago. Besides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale. When angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days. At one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year. But since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to. Late last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a "robust mechanism to address complaints", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved. Aggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause. A majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles. On 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities. The sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous. Ola has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing. It benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties. Critics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines. "Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build," said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV. Some top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. Experts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.

Netflix had its best quarter ever, according to earnings results announced Thursday afternoon, setting the stakes for Netflix stock moving forward after it emerged as a perhaps surprising stock market safe haven during the recent slump. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends a Netflix premiere in February. In its Q1 report released shortly after 4 p.m. EDT market close, Netflix reported its best-ever quarterly earnings per share and revenue numbers. Netflix scored $6.61 EPS ($2.9 billion net income) and $10.54 billion last quarter, besting consensus analyst estimates calling for the entertainment titan to report $5.67 adjusted EPS ($2.5 billion net income) and $10.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet data. The company said it expects $11 billion in sales and $7.03 EPS during the second quarter, topping top and bottom line forecasts of $10.9 billion and $6.25, respectively. Shares of Netflix rose 1.2% to $973 on Thursday, surging another 3% in after-hours trading to nearly $1,000 per share. Netflix has emerged from the 2025 stock losses stronger, gaining 4% since April 2 and 9% year-to-date. That came as the S&P 500 (down 6% since April 2, 10% year-to-date excluding dividends) and the Nasdaq (-7%, -15%) both pulled back as President Donald Trump’s trade war heightened recession concerns. Many analysts herald Netflix stock as a safe parking spot as economic slowdown fears swirl. “If a recession hits, we would expect Netflix subscribers to be sticky as Netflix is a stay-at-home cheap diversion, of the type that has held up well in past recessions,” Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a Monday note to clients. “Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors,” Bank of America analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich concurred in a Tuesday note. Netflix has far outperformed other members of the “FAANG” group, smashing returns this year from the other high-growth technology names: Facebook parent Meta (down 14% year-to-date excluding dividends), Amazon (-21%), Apple (-21%) and Google parent Alphabet (-19%). Netflix has also outperformed Disney (-23% year-to-date) and Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery (-23%), though audio streamer Spotify’s 29% gain this year tops Netflix’s. Fellow FAANG constituents Alphabet and Amazon will join Netflix in reporting Q1 earnings next week. Both West Coast titans will deliver results next Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Nvidia has lost $250 billion worth of market cap in almost an instant
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-h20-chips-jensen-huang-trump-1851776659
Time Published: 2025-04-17T19:10:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock continues to fall after the company reported that it would take a $5.5 billion hit due to export controls implemented by the Trump administration. After Thursday’s stock drop, Nvidia has lost more than $250 billion in market cap value since Tuesday. The chipmaker’s stock fell by as much as 4% on Thursday after plunging 7% the day before. Nvidia remains the third-largest U.S. company by market cap. On Tuesday night, the company announced the $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China, citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The chips were developed to comply with Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China. Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) analysts said in a Wednesday note that the H20 ban was expected — but that the size of it wasn’t. On Thursday, Stifel (SF+3.26%) analysts said they maintain confidence in Nvidia’s long-term growth, even amid these Trump-imposed restrictions. While short-term volatility is a possibility, the analysts said the company’s overall growth trajectory is strong and reliable. Analysts for the investment banking company added that the situation underscores the current global trade war policies and the effect they have on the tech industry. Dutch semiconductor company ASML (ASML+1.37%) reported first-quarter sales slightly below forecasts and flagged the “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions, warning that new tariffs and restrictions could weigh on its outlook for this year — and next. Stifel analysts noted that Nvidia’s decision to take such a large charge indicates a possible lack of confidence that the necessary export licenses will be granted by the current presidential administration or that no further regulations will be imposed. Still, analysts upheld their “buy” rating and a price target of $180.00 for the company. According to InvestingPro data, Nvidia maintains a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating exceptional financial strength. Meanwhile, the New York Times (NYT+0.29%) reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went to Beijing to meet with Chinese trade officials. According to state media, Huang emphasized his company’s commitment to the foreign market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” But there could be trouble for Huang back home: The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s business in Asia, focusing on whether the company violated export rules, particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Wedbush Securities said in a note Thursday morning that the chip ban was the “first shots fired” in a potential trade war and said that Nvidia and other U.S. tech companies are “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: All Yellow - Frank McNally on singing Emily Dickinson, Joyce’s advanced maths, and quantum mechanics in Blackrock

The fact had somehow escaped me until an email responding to Wednesday’s column about Emily Dickinson. And I’m not sure if I wasn’t better off without the information. But as I now know, for good or bad, most if not all of Dickinson’s poems can be sung to the tune of a traditional American ballad, The Yellow Rose of Texas. For this, I’m indebted to reader Seán Lyons, who tells me he first learned it from a lecture by an American professor at Listowel Writers’ Week a few years back. A long-time admirer of Dickinson, Lyons now sees her in a completely different light: “I cannot read her poems since without mentally donning a 10-gallon hat, and heading towards the sunset, just my rifle, my pony, and me.” Sure enough, I too have suddenly taken to humming “Hope is the thing with feathers–/That perches in the soul”, in a jaunty, thigh-slapping, hoedown rhythm. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,/And Mourners to and fro” has also acquired a whole new personality. But it’s not just The Yellow Rose of Texas, apparently. There are many other songs you can sing Dickinson’s poems to just as well. That’s in part because she wrote in ballad (or hymnal) meter. It may also be an effect of her famous dashes, which break up the lines in a way that Ronnie Drew might have done, to pause for beneath. Whatever the reason, it makes my image of her sharing a bench on the Royal Canal with Brendan Behan seem even more plausible. I don’t know if The Yellow Rose of Texas was one of Behan’s party pieces, but in his memoir Hold Your Hour and Have Another, he mentions someone else singing it in his presence during a pub session in Co Down once. Yellow was not an apt colour that day. It was the Twelfth of July, in the overwhelmingly unionist village of Millisle. Despite being a red-roaring republican, the mischievous Behan was disappointed the old man singing did not choose “something more Orange”. Discussing Euler’s Identity, “the most beautiful equation in maths”, in Thursday’s Irish Times, Peter Lynch was nevertheless mystified as to why a recent visitor to the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove wrote the formula into the visitors’ book. I don’t know either, but perhaps the tower’s circularity inspired thoughts of Pi, one of the numbers used in the equation? Or maybe the visitor was responding to what he saw as the beauty of Joyce’s maths, especially in the construction of Finnegans Wake. I’m thinking of a study by physicists in Poland some years ago, which analysed sentence-length and other patterns in 100 works of literature. FW was the standout result. The study found that its structures mimicked “purely mathematical multifractals”. By his own estimation at the time he was writing it, Joyce was attempting to square the circle. “I am making an engine with only one wheel,” he told his benefactor Harriet Weaver. “No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I’m driving at, don’t you? […] It’s a wheel ... And it’s all square.” Joyce was of course born in a square, in 1882. But even then, there were complications. The square – Brighton Square in Rathgar – was and remains, notoriously, a triangle. The same Martello tower was the venue on Wednesday for the announcement of a new, marathon Bloomsday event, the first instalment of which will take place on June 14th. No, it’s not a mere reading marathon: there are plenty of those already. This will involve athletic activity, the more enthusiastic participants in which will cover 100km. The goal is to run from Sandycove to Mullingar, a town in which the young Joyce spent a formative summer and which also features in Ulysses. Hardline athletes will leave the Martello tower at 6am on the Saturday in question. But the event is not a race, organisers insist. Nor are most of those taking part are not expected to make the full trek. Other suggested starting points include Maynooth, Enfield and Kinnegad. Even 5km sections of the route are encouraged. The main thing is to get to Mullingar around 5pm, for further fun. The Joycean connection aside, half the point is to celebrate the aforementioned Royal Canal and its Greenway. Hence the “Royal Canal Odyssey”, to give the event its full name. More details are at royalcanalodyssey.ie Getting back to advanced maths, I was briefly alarmed by the subheading on our restaurant review yesterday: “Tucked away above a main street bar, Blackrock gets its Barcelona moment.” The thought of Blackrock being tucked away in the upstairs room of a pub somewhere suggested an experiment by Flann O’Brien’s mad scientist De Selby gone wrong. He was last seen running amok in a neighbouring suburb (The Dalkey Archive, 1964). But his creator was a regular in at least one Blackrock pub, so De Selby could well have been implicated here too. Happily, as the story revealed, Blackrock has not turned into a black hole. It’s only a new restaurant that is tucked away over a bar, not that the entire suburb has collapsed in on itself. This must have been a great relief to all concerned. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Activism OffGuardian Our successor to This Week in the Guardian, This Week in the New Normal is our weekly chart of the progress of autocracy, authoritarianism and economic restructuring around the world. Klaus Schwab, founder and leader of the World Economic Forum, is “beginning the process” of stepping down from his duties as chairman of the board of trustees. This “process” is apparently going to take until at least January 2027, so right there you have to wonder how real any of this is at all. But there is precedent, as this announcement follows on from his resignation as Chief Executive in 2023, a role he was succeeded in by Norwegian politician Børge Brende. Now, while an 87 year old man (allegedly) retiring is not, of itself, newsworthy it does raise interesting questions. Such as “why now?” and “who is replacing him?” As to the former, I would guess it’s because Klaus is now tainted. He is too publicly associated with Covid and the “Great Reset”. His presence immediately turns people off, his ideas are instantly suspected. It’s the same reason you don’t see Bill Gates giving as many interviews as you did during Covid. These are the faces of the New Normal agenda, and as that agenda becomes more covert than overt the people who proudly nailed their colours to its mast need to be pushed aside so the greater work can continue. That’s not to say they are being actually rejected or their ideas repudiated, of course, just that their public association is damaging. In the latter case, one early rumor suggested Tony Blair would be taking the job, but (if my reasoning can be trusted) that was never likely. Replacing Schwab with Blair to reduce bad press is like replacing your toaster with a flamethrower so you don’t burn your muffins. Other potential replacements include the other members of the board – Christine Lagarde of the ECB, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. But they largely have the same issue as Blair – namely, they are creepy and everyone hates them. I would suspect that a good portion of the next 18 months of “stepping down process” will be spent holding auditions for some bland-faced Trudeau-like “nice guy” type who can say all the same things Uncle Klaus used to say, without looking and sounding like a Bond villain. Tariffs and Trump and trade are taking up the headlines right now, with online censorship and Adolescence rushing to fill any gaps. Behind that, the now-familiar strains of music still play on a loop. Digital currency this, Covid that and – among other things – Bird Flu. Mexico’s Health Ministry recorded its first official human case of Bird Flu this week, according to Reuters In India, it’s being reported that a two-year-old child died of bird flu after eating raw chicken. The details are unclear, but on the face of it that story makes no sense. In England, DEFRA have ordered stricter measures be put in place in the north after more cases of H5N1 were allegedly found in wild birds. The Conversation warns that bird flu “could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans”. There’s some background noise building. Just in time for an Easter – or post-Easter – scare maybe? I’m not a monster, screams the headline, but I regret having children: And you know what, fine. Maybe regretting having children doesn’t make you a monster, but writing an article about it that your children will likely one day see, does. But that’s just taking the story at face value. The author is anonymous, the names apparently made up, so maybe the whole thing is just a piece of propaganda attacking the idea of having a family. We’re all more than used to the “free speech is hurting our kids!” argument; there’s always someone somewhere mewling out some variation. This week that someone is Ian Russell, an “online safety campaigner”, and the somewhere is BBC Newsnight: "We cannot keep waiting for change to come." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, says there is a "rising anger" amongst bereaved families and calls for Ofcom to be "less timid".#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/W0B9jgrG6j My favourite bit is the part where he says that OfCom need to be “less timid” about enforcing an act…that only came into force 3 weeks ago. I also like how vague the term “real change” is. Just a little tip: When pundits get vague it’s for one of two reasons. Either they don’t know what they’re talking about, or they know the specifics will make them sound stupid. I’m guessing, in this instance, it’s the second one. All told a pretty hectic week for the new normal crowd, and we didn’t even mention the Colorado Bill that classify misgendering your child as “child abuse” or San Francisco’s “equity-based” speeding tickets, which charge you more (or less) depending on your income.

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026.

Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

By Paige Gross, Stateline.org The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two. It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today. “Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.” As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information. For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say. “We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.” As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai. To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade. As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year. “And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.” The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively. Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing. Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said. “If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.” Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027. As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges. The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported. Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE. Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills. Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community. “The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said. Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers. But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand. “The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said. The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found. Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said. “The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.” Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January. The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said. “I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.” For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit. Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example. With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high. “We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?” Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center. Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed” large data centers. Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices. “It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’” ©2025 States Newsroom.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Movies How Movie Studio Spies Size Up the Competition Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Mumbai: Jio Financial Services Ltd. infused additional equity of ₹1,346 crore into its group entities in FY25 to fuel “future growth aspirations and support the growing scale of the diverse businesses”. The group entities that received the funding include Jio Finance Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, and the joint ventures with BlackRock for asset management and wealth management, the company said as part of its earnings for the fourth quarter of FY25. Jio Financial is the listed core investment company (CIC), which acts as the holding company for eleven group entities, including the three joint ventures with US-based BlackRock—Jio BlackRock Investment Advisors for the broking and wealth business, Jio BlackRock Asset Management and Jio BlackRock Trustee Pvt Ltd for the mutual fund business. Read more: For Wipro, tariff-led macro uncertainty makes things messy The parent said the senior leadership and core business teams are in place for the asset management company, which filed its application for final approval in FY25. The company has also developed a unified investment platform and deployed infrastructure to launch “with a defined product roadmap and go-to-market strategy”. The company filed an application for a broking licence in March 2025, and another under the wealth business for a registered investment advisor licence. With these lines of business, the current focus is on the mass affluent and higher income segments, the company said. It defines mass affluent as customers with an annual income of ₹7-25 lakh, affluent as those with an income of ₹25 lakh to ₹1 crore a year, and high net worth individuals (HNIs) and ultra HNIs as those with even higher incomes. "The year was defined by swift product launches, strengthening distribution across key markets, and rapid growth in the JioFinance app’s user base. In FY26, we will build upon this momentum by leveraging our integrated data infrastructure and AI-driven analytics to offer the right product to the right customer, through the right channel,” said managing director and chief executive Hitesh Sethia.

Profit after tax for FY25 was ₹1,613 crore, slightly higher than ₹1,605 crore in the previous year, with a rise in staff and operating expenses, and provisions, weighing on the bottom line. Consolidated assets of the company fell 7.8% on-year to ₹1.3 trillion, led by a reduction in the value of investments and cash and bank balances. Assets under management of the lending and leasing business, under Jio Finance Ltd, grew nearly 2.5-fold on-year to ₹10,053 crore as at the end of March 2025.

Hi Tim, Just wanted to comment on the quote you have on today’s 5 Bullet Friday. This may come off as a too pessimistic of a perspective, and I guess Buckingham gives this insight as a part of a broader context that is cohesive and sensible, but I want to share my first thought nevertheless: Finding the most generous explanation for the other’s behavior each time and believing it will bring a collossal misery and grief if the other person is a gaslighter with narcissistic tendencies. I’d humbly say the key is getting to know the person in one’s personal, and business, relationships in a realistic way, which is not an easy feat. Just my two cents.

Title: Why New China Chip Export Curbs Could Affect Far More Than Just Nvidia, AMD

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) "Rising AI restrictions are likely to impact other key AI-levered computing, networking and optical stocks (AVGO, AMD, MU, ARM, MRVL, COHR, LITE) and raise concerns around enhanced restrictions in other areas," Bank of America analysts said following the news from Nvidia. Like Morgan Stanley analysts, they added Nvidia's write-down indicates a "low probability of future licenses" to circumvent the new restrictions, and that AI diﬀusion rules set to take effect in May could further limit sales of American AI hardware to a broader set of countries. Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Thursday, "We expect hardly any tech companies to give guidance over the next month given this Twilight Zone backdrop. While the Nvidia news is concerning it's not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides before cooler heads prevail and negotiations in some form can begin to play out over the coming weeks/months."

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Many are sitting on a goldmine of skills and will retire, not realizing what they could have ... More achieved in their lifetime You’ve likely helped a college friend rewrite their resume, explained a process clearly to a co-worker, or simplified a tech tool when a family member just wasn’t getting it. You never charged for these services. But while you’re not charging…someone else is. Most people sit on skills that could easily be turned into an asset that makes them anywhere from $500, to $5,000, or even five figures a month. But, like you, they overlook them and write these skills off as normal, nothing special. Unfortunately, when finances are tight, the cost of living is up, layoffs are looming, and inflation creeps into everyday items like eggs or major purchases like buying a house--they’re stuck with no options when they had plenty of options, they could have utilized all along. Are you sitting on a goldmine of skills that could be the key to unlocking financial freedom and career satisfaction? Let’s find out. To begin with, we’ll conduct a self-audit. Answering these questions helps uncover potential hidden skills--skills which you’ve had for a long while and are inherent to your nature, but which you haven't capitalized on because you don't think they're that significant. If you’re still struggling to identify yours, here are some examples that will spark your creative brainstorming, including what income sources they could lead to: Now that you’re ready to position yourself for success and take the leap in bringing your skills to the world, they’re no longer hidden; they’re going to be the number one thing you’re known for and associated with. To do this, you must ask yourself, Who needs a service that predominantly utilizes this skill? You can even ask ChatGPT to help you come up with ideas so you can brainstorm several side hustle ideas or business ideas using the skills that you have. This will give you an idea of what services you can bring to the market. Now conduct some research and pick a niche. Make it precise and highly specific. If you’re too general with your offer, you’ll appeal to no one at all. After doing this, clearly define your offer and what the expected positive outcome would be. Once you’ve laid this foundation, it’s time to build visibility and credibility online. You achieve this through creating digital assets such as: Acquiring testimonials from people you’ve worked with before, or delivering the service for free in return for reviews, to no more than five people Finally, price your skill according to value, not based on time or hours worked. Pricing by the hour limits your earning potential and leads to you inadvertently under-pricing your worth. Now, here’s the exciting part: where do you go to sell your skill and the service connected with it? Here are some examples (bear in mind that not all will be relevant depending on your business and industry vertical, but you can combine several of these together to get results): You can even create an entire online persona revolving around your once hidden skill, and end up becoming the face of it. Your skills are your best kept secret Your skills are your best kept secret. It’s time for the world to know who you really are. Stop sitting on your gifts. Instead of saying, “It’s nothing special,” begin treating all of your skills like assets.

April 17, 2025 11:33 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, April 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of purchasers of Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period may, no later than APRIL 28, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch and spacecraft design services. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google also removed underrepresented language from its grant website and scrubbed mention of diversity and equity from its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post that it would remain committed to DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Salesforce is getting rid of its diversity hiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Uber eliminated an incentive tied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value. It removed the entire diversity and inclusion section from its latest 10-K filing and made no use of the word diversity at all, according to the SF Examiner. UnitedHealth Group removed mention of DEI from much of its website. For example, several pages once dedicated to DEI no longer load, and the company also removed a 2022 blog post with a vice president about DEI. Yahoo removed several pages and sections that relate to or mention diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, its DEI page now redirects to the company’s executive leadership page, and the 2022 diversity report no longer loads. (Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of TechCrunch. On March 21, Regent announced it would acquire TechCrunch.) Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Title: Eli Lilly's weight loss pill could be just as good as Ozempic — and the stock soars

The first GLP-1 pill could be in medicine cabinets sooner than expected. Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) announced Thursday that its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, met company goals in the first of several late-stage trials — helping patients with Type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar while causing weight loss. The results were comparable with other GLP-1 injections on the market, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro. Orforglipron could give Lilly a key advantage over other pharmaceutical giants in the GLP-1 realm. Lilly’s stock was up 11% in premarket trading. Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.41%), which makes Ozempic, was down 6%. The results are pivotal: While the GLP-1 class of medication has become a blockbuster on the market (both for diabetes treatment and weight loss), they’re expensive, must be injected, and need to be kept refrigerated. A pill version would be a more convenient option that could be much more widely used. Lilly expects to file for global regulatory approval of orforglipron for weight management by the end of the year and for Type 2 diabetes in 2026. The phama giant currently sells Zepbound and Mounjaro for diabetes and weight loss — both of which are administered by injection. Orforglipron is the first small-molecule GLP-1 taken without food and water restrictions to successfully complete a Phase 3 trial. In a press release, the company said that if the drug is approved, Lilly is “confident in its ability to launch orforglipron worldwide without supply constraints.” Shortages of currently available GLP-1 medications have been a prevalent issue recently. David Ricks, Lilly’s CEO and chair, said, “As a convenient once-daily pill, orforglipron may provide a new option and, if approved, could be readily manufactured and launched at scale for use by people around the world.” Lilly’s pill involves complicated science that makes a nonpeptide act like a peptide. Japanese company Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. (RHHBY+0.76%), which figured out how to do just that, licensed its drug to Lilly in 2018. The resulting medication is a bit of a unicorn in the medical world: a peptide drug pill that can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill, Rybelsus, but it isn’t as effective as Lilly’s pill — it must be taken in large doses and also isn’t as effective as injectables because most of it is digested. Thursday’s results from Lilly are the first reported from seven large studies of orforglipron that are expected this year from the company. This first Phase 3 trial involved 559 people with Type 2 diabetes across the U.S., China, India, Japan, and Mexico — who either took orforglipron or a placebo for 40 weeks. In patients who received the medication, blood sugar levels dropped by about the same amount that patients taking Ozempic or Mounjaro experienced over that same period. The study measured weight loss as a secondary goal. Patients who received orforglipron also reported weight loss — up to 16 pounds without reaching a plateau, meaning more weight loss was possible on the medication. The 40-week results were similar to what patients taking Ozempic experienced but slightly less than those taking Mounjaro. Lilly’s trial participants reported side effects similar to other GLP-1s: diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Lilly said it expects Type 2 diabetes to affect an estimated 760 million adults by 2050. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of Americans are obese — and more than 10% have diabetes (most of whom have Type 2). According to a May 2024 study from KFF, 62% of adults who have taken GLP-1 drugs said they took them to treat a chronic condition (including diabetes or heart disease), and four in 10 adults said they took the drugs to lose weight.

Title: Nvidia's CEO went to China and promised to 'unswervingly serve the Chinese market'

Time Published: 2025-04-17T15:12:17Z

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT+0.29%) reported. The H20 — a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions — had become central to the company’s China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia’s stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday. While in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia’s commitment to the market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” Back in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules — particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips. As Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” The firm called the chip ban the “first shots fired” in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7–10%. While the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year — over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar. And with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang’s balancing act — between regulatory compliance and global expansion — just got significantly harder.

A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Title: New Zealand Tire Market Trends, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2025-2033 | Astute Analytica

Time Published: 2025-04-17T13:30:00Z
Full Content:
April 17, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Zealand Tire market was valued at US$ 800.24 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1,312.16 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.40% during the forecast period 2025–2033. New Zealand’s Tire market is undergoing a transformative shift toward sustainability, driven by stringent environmental regulations and eco-conscious consumers. In 2024, the government’s Tirewise stewardship scheme, which mandates Tire producers to fund recycling initiatives, has spurred innovation in material recovery. For instance, 68% of end-of-life Tires are now repurposed into asphalt or playground surfaces, up from 52% in 2022. Major brands like Bridgestone and Goodyear have introduced Tires with 30–40% recycled rubber content, targeting urban consumers in Auckland and Wellington, where eco-awareness is highest. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/new-zealand-tire-market These shifts are altering supply chains of the Tire market in the country. Local distributors partner with Michelin to test silica-based compounds that reduce rolling resistance by 15%, enhancing fuel efficiency. However, small retailers in rural regions face cost barriers, with sustainable Tires priced 20% higher than conventional ones. To bridge this gap, startups like KiwiTires leverage crowdfunding to subsidize eco-friendly options for farmers. Consumer surveys reveal that 63% of buyers under 40 prioritize sustainability over brand loyalty, compelling manufacturers to recalibrate R&D budgets. This trend is redefining competition, as environmental compliance emerges as a key differentiator. Key Findings in New Zealand Tire Market Regulatory Pressures Accelerate Adoption of Smart Tire Technologies New Zealand’s transport safety regulations, updated in 2023, now require fleet operators to use Tires with embedded sensors for real-time tread monitoring. This has propelled a 45% annual growth in smart Tire sales since 2022, with logistics giants like Mainfreight adopting Bridgestone’s ‘Tire Logic’ systems in the Tire market. These sensors detect pressure loss and alignment issues, reducing roadside failures by 27% in heavy vehicles. Auckland-based start-up Torc Analytics offers retrofit sensor kits, capturing 12% of the regional commercial market. Despite progress, consumer adoption lags. Only 18% of private vehicle owners use smart Tires, citing high upfront costs (averaging NZ$400 per Tire). To counter this, Firestone’s ‘Pay-as-You-Drive’ subscription model links Tire costs to mileage, appealing to ride-share drivers in Christchurch. Meanwhile, insurers like AA offer 10% premium discounts for sensor-equipped cars, incentivizing uptake. Challenges persist in standardizing data protocols, as fragmented systems complicate fleet management. Regulatory nudges and tech partnerships will dominate this segment’s growth trajectory through 2025. Import Dependency and Currency Volatility Strain Pricing Strategies New Zealand’s Tire market remains tethered to Asian manufacturing hubs, with nine out of ten Tires imported from countries like Thailand, China, and Indonesia. This dependency exacerbates pricing instability, particularly for agricultural and industrial segments reliant on specialized imports. For instance, Firestone’s Maxi Traction IF Tires—a staple for Canterbury dairy farms—are produced in Thailand, where shipping delays due to Red Sea disruptions in early 2024 inflated costs by NZ$85 per unit. Concurrently, the New Zealand dollar’s depreciation against Asian currencies forced dealers like TireHub to markup premium tractor Tires by 12%, squeezing mid-sized farmers already grappling with low milk payouts. Efforts to diversify sourcing face logistical hurdles in the Tire market. Bridgestone’s pivot to Indonesian suppliers for its popular “V-Steel” tractor range reduced lead times by three weeks, but Tauranga Port’s congestion caused 20-day delays for Southland’s planting season. Some retailers mitigate volatility through pre-hedged contracts: AGrowQuip, a North Island Agri-tech dealer, locks in euro-based pricing for Michelin’s sprayer Tires six months in advance, shielding clients from 40% of forex fluctuations. However, grey-market imports from Malaysia—often lacking NZTA certification—undercut authorized dealers by 25%, compromising safety standards in regions like Waikato. Regional Climate Variations Drive Demand for Specialized Tire Formulations New Zealand’s microclimates necessitate hyper-localized Tire engineering, particularly for agriculture. Independent field tests in the Waikato region revealed Firestone’s Maxi Traction IF Tires improved traction by 15% on waterlogged soils compared to conventional models, critical for heavy harvesters navigating autumn rains. In Otago’s alpine zones, Cooper Tires’ “WeatherMaster” line incorporates silica compounds that retain flexibility at -10°C, reducing frost-induced cracking by 60% during winter trials. Coastal challenges demand equally tailored solutions in the New Zealand Tire market. Pirelli’s “Scorpion All-Terrain Plus”, engineered for Northland’s salt-laden air, uses corrosion-resistant bead wires to extend lifespan by 18 months in mussel-farming regions. Yet, low-volume production inflates costs: a single 16.9R34 “Mud-Shed” Tire for West Coast logging costs NZ$1,200—double the price of standard variants—due to bespoke moulds required for clay-shedding treads. Bridgestone’s modular retread kits address this, allowing Gisborne citrus growers to swap seasonal tread patterns for under NZ$300 per Tire, blending cost efficiency with climatic adaptability. E-Commerce Platforms Disrupt Traditional Tire Distribution Channels Online sales now account for one-third of NZ’s replacement Tire market, with agricultural buyers leading the shift. TireHub’s e-commerce portal, offering AI-driven fitment tools for tractors and harvesters, reduced misorder rates by 30% in 2024, particularly for complex SKUs like Firestone’s 480/80R50 radial flotation Tires. Urban consumers flock to platforms like TireSlick for price transparency, but rural adoption hinges on hybrid logistics: FastTire’s partnership with Farmlands Co-operative enables stock pickup at 78 rural service centers, slashing last-mile costs by NZ$45 per order. Traditional retailers counter with value-added services in the Tire market. Beaurepaires’ “Tire Connect” portal provides real-time inventory tracking for niche agricultural Tires like BKT’s 18.4-16 R1 Row Crop models, while its in-house leasing program covers 80% of maintenance costs for loyal clients. However, counterfeit risks persist online: 12% of Facebook Marketplace listings for “discounted” Pirelli SprayMaster Tires failed NZTA’s load index tests in 2024, prompting Federated Farmers to issue a national advisory. Explore customization options: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/new-zealand-tire-market Agricultural Sector’s Shift to Precision Farming Influences Tire Specifications Precision farming’s rise has redefined Tire market’s performance metrics. Firestone’s “CycleMax” technology, integrated into 70% of Waikato’s GPS-guided tractors, uses pressure sensors to reduce soil compaction by 22%—a critical factor for dairy farms targeting pasture recovery. In Marlborough’s vineyards, Michelin’s “VitiSpray” Tires, with 12% narrower contact patches, minimize root damage during spraying cycles, cutting replanting costs by NZ$8,000 per hectare annually. Yet, adoption gaps persist. Small-scale sheep stations in the Mackenzie Basin struggle with the NZ$14,000 outlay for telemetry-compatible radial Tires, prompting Bridgestone to pilot a carbon-credit leasing model. Under this scheme, farmers using low-compaction Tires earn credits redeemable against future purchases—a strategy already adopted by 15% of Otago’s high-country stations. Meanwhile, legacy equipment compatibility remains a hurdle: nearly 40% of Hawke’s Bay’s vintage tractors still run cross-ply Tires, which lack the pressure adjustability needed for precision systems. Urbanization and Ride-Sharing Trends Reshape Replacement Cycles in Tire Market New Zealand’s urban population growth (2.1% annually since 2020) and booming ride-share usage (12M trips monthly in Auckland) are shortening Tire replacement cycles. Uber drivers replace Tires every 18 months, compared to 3 years for private users, driving a 28% uptick in high-mileage Tire sales. Hankook’s ‘Kinergy PT’ promises 80,000-km durability, securing contracts with Zoomy and Ola. Parking constraints in cities like Wellington boost demand for run-flat Tires, which constitute 17% of urban sales. However, 43% of workshops lack specialized equipment to repair them, creating bottlenecks. Service providers in the New Zealand Tire market like Bridgestone Select invest in training programs to address this gap. As ride-sharing penetrates regional hubs (e.g., Hamilton and Tauranga), tier-2 cities are becoming battlegrounds for fleet-focused Tire brands.

Title: Markets search for footing as earnings roll in and Washington deflects blame

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), and Boeing (BA+2.21%) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China. The broader tech sector continues to grapple with geopolitical fallout, regulatory uncertainty, and earnings jitters. The Nasdaq remains down about 15% year to date. As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-0.94%), Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), American Express (AXP+1.95%), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI+1.46%). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL+2.21%) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-0.94%), Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), American Express (AXP+1.95%), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI+1.46%). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL+2.21%) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), and Boeing (BA+2.21%) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China.

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.94%) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL+2.21%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP+1.95%) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI+1.46%) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%.

Title: Microsoft Stock At $370: Opportunity Or Trap?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. WEST BENGAL, INDIA - 2024/12/11: In this photo illustration, a Microsoft Azure logo is seen ... More displayed on a smartphone with a Microsoft logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The current period presents concerns for broader markets, which inevitably create challenges for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Growing economic anxieties in the United States, fueled by the implementation of tariffs and an escalating trade war, are fostering a generally unfavorable market climate. While Microsoft’s stock has not been immune, declining from nearly $450 in January to around $370, its drop has been less severe than some other tech stocks. This relative resilience can be attributed to Microsoft’s limited exposure to China (reportedly low-single-digits contribution to sales) and its focus on the software and cloud side of its business, offering some insulation from global trade tensions. Separately see – ASML Stock To $400? The question now is whether to buy MSFT stock at $370. We think so. Our positive outlook is based on a comprehensive analysis comparing Microsoft’s current valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its present and historical financial standing.

Microsoft’s profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft's balance sheet looks very strong. MSFT stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Microsoft's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Given Microsoft's very strong performance across key parameters, the stock presents an attractive investment opportunity. While its valuation may appear high when compared to the broader market, Microsoft's current trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30x is actually lower than its three-year average of 33x. Coupled with the continued robust growth expected from its cloud offerings, Microsoft appears to be a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors at the current levels. Although near-term volatility related to ongoing tariffs does pose a risk, for investors with a time horizon of 3 to 5 years, we believe MSFT is a sound stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. logo is seen displayed ... More on a monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock appears relatively expensive, making it a costly investment at its current price of around $93. We believe there are some minor issues with AMD stock that contribute to its high valuation. The surge in generative AI has fueled strong GPU demand, but AMD’s AI accelerator segment has fallen short of expectations. In Q4, AMD’s data center revenue—a key indicator of its AI chip performance—was $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. The company also issued a soft outlook, noting that current-quarter data center sales may decline 7% sequentially. Former President Donald Trump’s trade policies could also pose risks to companies like AMD. While there is limited clarity on the semiconductor tariffs due to inconsistent messaging from the White House, the threat remains for AMD, as it sources most of its chips from Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Additionally, AMD has a thinner margin buffer to withstand tariffs compared to competitors like Nvidia due to its lower gross margins. Our assessment of Advanced Micro Devices using key parameters like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows the company is strong operationally and financially, despite its rich valuation. For those seeking returns with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers an alternative—it has outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered over 91% returns since inception. Relative to sales and profit, AMD stock appears quite expensive compared to the broader market. • AMD has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6 versus 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) is 69.0 vs. 21.3 for the S&P 500 • The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 87.7 compared to 21.3 for the benchmark Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have grown significantly in recent years. • The company has recorded an average revenue growth of 17.8% over the past 3 years (vs. 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Revenues have increased 13.7% from $23 Bil to $26 Bil in the past 12 months (vs. 5.3% growth for the S&P 500) • Its latest quarterly revenue rose 24.2% to $7.7 Bil from $6.2 Bil a year ago (vs. 4.9% growth for the S&P 500) AMD’s profit margins lag behind most firms covered by Trefis. • Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.1 Bil, reflecting a low Operating Margin of 8.1% (vs. 13.1% for S&P 500) • Operating Cash Flow was $3.0 Bil, implying a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 11.8% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) AMD’s balance sheet appears robust. • The company had $2.2 Bil in debt at the end of the latest quarter versus a $152 Bil market cap (as of 4/11/2025), resulting in a very low Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.5% (vs. 21.5% for S&P 500) [Note: Lower is better] • With $5.1 Bil in cash among $69 Bil in total assets, AMD has a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (vs. 15.0% for S&P 500) AMD has underperformed the S&P 500 during several past downturns. Concerned about a crash? Check out our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? and see detailed comparisons to past market crashes. • Stock fell 65.4% from $161.91 (Nov 29, 2021) to $55.94 (Oct 14, 2022), while S&P 500 declined 25.4% • Fully recovered to prior peak by Jan 18, 2024 • Rose to $211.38 on Mar 7, 2024, and now trades at ~$93 • Dropped 34.3% from $58.90 (Feb 19) to $38.71 (Mar 16), nearly matching S&P 500's 33.9% drop • Recovered to pre-crisis level by Jul 22, 2020 • Plunged 91.2% from $20.35 (Jan 2007) to $1.80 (Nov 2008), vs. S&P 500's 56.8% drop • Recovered by Aug 21, 2018 Here’s how AMD fares across key metrics: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Weak • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak • Overall: Neutral Given its lofty valuation, AMD stock looks relatively expensive, which aligns with our conclusion that it is currently not an ideal buy. The high valuation restricts upside in the near to mid-term. Instead, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed a combined all-cap index benchmark. Why? Its quarterly-rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks helps capture gains in strong markets while limiting losses in downturns, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Tariffs Will Affect Grocery Prices, According to an Agro-Economics Professor

We asked an agriculture and economics expert about where consumers can expect food price hikes in the future. Grocery prices may rise even further if Trump's tariffs go back into effect. President Donald Trump's trade war has been a wild-moving target with severe economic implications. The most recent announcement and subsequent 90-day pause of tariffs affected thousands of imports from dozens of countries and sent the stock market reeling, but what could sweeping tariffs on China and other countries mean for food and grocery prices? Hours before the pause on Trump's newest tariffs was announced, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for everyday shoppers in the US. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are If you're just catching up, on April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. Days later, when the tariffs went into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. While it's still unclear whether the Trump Administration will extend the 90-day pause on the rest of the previously announced tariffs, the large tariff on China could still have an impact on American food costs. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge [or tariff] on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the European Union -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." The tariffs may cause supply issues leading to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Many of the Avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump Administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) finished more than 22% lower Thursday in the stock's worst day in over 25 years after the health-care giant's first-quarter results fell short of analysts' estimates and it cut its profit forecasts for 2025. UnitedHealth reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.20 on revenue that rose 10% year-over-year to $109.58 billion. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $7.25 and $111.46 billion, respectively. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based company lowered its 2025 EPS outlook to a range of $24.65 to $25.15 and its adjusted EPS projection to $26 to $26.50. Last quarter, UnitedHealth said it expected to generate full-year EPS of $28.15 to $28.65 and adjusted EPS from $29.50 to $30. UnitedHealth attributed the outlook cuts to "heightened care activity indications" in its Medicare Advantage business, and "unanticipated changes in the profile of Optum Health members impacting planned 2025 reimbursement." Analysts have said rising medical costs and lower government reimbursements for Medicare Advantage claims mean higher expenses for insurers that operate those plans like UnitedHealth, CNBC reported. As UnitedHealth shares closed Thursday with their fourth-worst performance since the company went public in 1984, shares of other health insurers like CVS Health (CVS), Humana (HUM), Elevance Health (ELV), and Centene (CNC) also were dragged lower Thursday by the cost concerns. CEO Andrew Witty said the company "did not perform up to our expectations, and we are aggressively addressing those challenges to position us well for the years ahead." UnitedHealth shares entered the day up about 16% since the start of the year, recovering from a February slump following a report that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the company's diagnosing practices.

In what is nothing short of a bombshell commentary that again places Intel's future within the raging vortex of uncertainty, TSMC has declared during its earnings call that it is not interested in forming a JV with other companies. $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $MU $NVDA $TSM's solid Q1'25 earnings & guidance push markets higher overnight.🟢 EPS: $2.14 vs $2.07 est (beat by $0.07) 🟢 Rev: $25.77B vs $25.72B est (beat by $0.05B) 🟢 Q2 Rev Guidance: $28.4B-$29.2B vs $27.2B est.🟢 Gross Margin: 58.8% vs 53% y/y pic.twitter.com/vPSPxGOT3W — Gigavest (@Gigavest) April 17, 2025 For the benefit of those who might not be aware, TSMC has just published solid results for its Q1 2025 earnings, managing to post a trifecta of beats: exceeded consensus expectations on its top-line and bottom-line metrics as well as raised its revenue guidance for the ongoing second quarter by $1.6 billion (based on the midpoint of the provided range). TSMC earned $25.77 billion in revenue in Q1 2025 vs. expectations of $25.72 billion. For Q2, the fab giant expects to haul in revenues of between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion (midpoint at $28.8 billion). Based on its visible H1 run-rate, TSMC is now on course to haul in $109 billion in revenue for FY 2025. — U.S. TARIFFS HAVE NOT IMPACTED CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; DEMAND CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED SUPPLY. — PRODUCTION YIELDS IN ARIZONA ARE COMPARABLE TO TAIWAN FACILITIES; EXPECTED THAT 30% OF 2NM CAPACITY WILL EVENTUALLY BE BASED IN ARIZONA.$TSM $TSMC https://t.co/zHGRc3jKs6 — Michael Kitara (@MichaelKitara) April 17, 2025 Elsewhere, while conceding to the US tariff-related uncertainties ahead, TSMC says that it has seen no impact on customer behavior so far. As a refresher, NVIDIA and AMD have both disclosed significant financial hits from the Trump administration's recent imposition of licensing requirements on the H20 and MI308 GPUs, respectively. Also, TSMC has declared that the yields in its Arizona fab are now comparable to those in its Taiwan facilities. Moreover, the company now intends to increase its investments in the US to $165 billion. TSMC has no intention of forming joint ventures or engaging in technology sharing with other companies. (@intel) Puts stop to all the rumors. $TSM — Parv sharma (@Parv_S) April 17, 2025 Of course, the most critical comment to come out of TSMC's earnings call was its refusal to enter into any JV or technology transfer agreements with other companies, read Intel. Bear in mind that reports in recent days indicated that Intel and TSMC had apparently reached an understanding to constitute a JV that would then manage Intel's US-based fabs. The arrangement would have also roped in other chip designers such as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple. For its part, TSMC would have retained a 20 percent stake in the JV, financed via its in-kind contribution of technology and expertise. The Taiwanese fab giant, however, has now clearly denied any possibility of just such an outcome. Citi, of course, has remained skeptical of a JV between TSMC and Intel from the beginning, going on to declare: "We do not believe TSMC operating/forming a JV with Intel would work given differences in manufacturing and operations."

Title: Inside WPP’s $150 million InfoSum purchase
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/inside-wpps-150-million-infosum-purchase/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Editor’s Note: This piece was updated and then re-edited to reflect GroupM’s characterization of WPP’s relationship to the market. WPP’s acquisition of data clean room InfoSum has raised eyebrows both inside and outside the industry, not just because of what it signals about the holding company’s ambitions but also because of what it reveals about its anxieties. Let’s start with the upside. The holdco has bought a business it believes, rightly or wrongly, can bolster its cash cow: GroupM. The media buying unit has faced those pressures for some time, and those cracks have played a role in several high-profile client departures over the past year. Yes, WPP has chalked up some headline wins recently — Amazon and Unilever, to name a couple — but there’s no denying that whatever GroupM is selling, CMOs aren’t buying it like they used to. The pitch is simple enough. InfoSum’s clean room uses federated learning to let marketers work with sensitive data without actually moving or exposing it. In theory, this enables rich insights by combining first-party data with a vast pool of privacy-safe signals — hundreds of billions of them — sourced from the likes of Netflix, Samsung Ads, and Channel 4, along with data partners like Experian and TransUnion. It’s the kind of offering that could further GroupM’s ongoing efforts to stitch together insights across fragmented platforms. But for all the strategic logic, the road ahead is murky. For all InfoSum’s promise, the clean room category itself is in transition. Once heralded as the cornerstone of privacy-first advertising, clean rooms lost some of their shine once marketers realized they solved only part of the puzzle. On their own, they don’t deliver the scale, simplicity, or seamless outcomes CMOs expect, especially in a landscape preferring retail media channels where data activation and measurement come bundled. In addition to the high costs, technical complexity, and limited interoperability, it’s easy to see why clean rooms have struggled to scale as point solutions. More and more, they’re being folded into larger tech stacks or absorbed into cloud infrastructure — seen as less of a strategy and more of a supporting feature. WPP may view InfoSum as a strategic linchpin for GroupM and Choreograph, but the bigger question is whether it can transform a specialized tool into something that moves the whole machine. And then there’s the trust problem. InfoSum’s appeal was built over nearly a decade on neutrality — a Switzerland for sensitive data. That’s a much harder pitch now. No matter how WPP frames it, it’s tough to imagine rival holding companies lining up to upload customer data into a platform now owned by one of their fiercest competitors. The promise of independence, once central to InfoSum’s volume, is up for debate the moment its ownership changes hands. Little wonder, then, that the deal has left some WPP clients, partners and even rivals scratching their heads over its swoop for InfoSum. One GroupM client told Digiday they had reservations over how the deal would really add value to the agency network. “Even before the deal, we were already considering whether to put the account up for review at some point this year or next,” the marketer said. Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun highlighted the challenges of integrating a clean room like InfoSum into a wider proposition during the company’s earnings call earlier this week, underscoring how closely the industry is watching not just what WPP bought but what it will now do with it. “A clean room alone is an empty shell,” said Sadoun. “If you don’t add proprietary data that will bring to your client something that they don’t have then they won’t find a new source of goals. They won’t be able to connect every individual to the entire media ecosystem.” In the weeks leading up to the purchase, InfoSum pursued a $25 million Series C investment — it raised $93 million across its prior funding rounds. InfoSum CEO Lauren Wetzel told Digiday WPP was eager to participate in the round, but it soon evolved into a wholesale takeover. “About a week out from closing the Series C, one of those investors who was new to the cap table along with WPP shifted gears and felt very strongly there was more of an opportunity for a [sale] transaction,” she added. WPP did not disclose the sum it paid for its new acquisition in its April 3 announcement, prompting speculation over InfoSum’s final exit figure. This was further fueled when Chrysalis — the lead participant of InfoSum’s 2021 raise, when it was valued at $300 million — announced a $63 million liquidation of its stake in the U.K.-headquartered company on the same day. Estimated exit prices vary, although separate sources (both of whom were investors in InfoSum) told Digiday the eventual sale price was approximately $150 million. WPP declined Digiday’s requests to comment on these claims. While Wetzel didn’t comment on the financials of the sale, she spoke on the decision to switch from raising a Series C to signing off on an acquisition. “It was compelling for our investors,” she said, “and it had to be for me to change my mind.” Additionally, sources claimed InfoSum made dozens of layoffs in the weeks leading up to the purchase — Digiday understands this number is lower than 20 — a period when Companies House initiated compulsory strike-off proceedings. According to Wetzel, who is now also GroupM’s chief solutions officer, the March 4 notice, which marked the beginning of a process that could have resulted in InfoSum’s compulsory dissolution, was the result of its fundraising efforts. According to Wetzel, the timing of its efforts to raise a Series C round meant InfoSum deferred filing its accounts with the registry of all U.K. businesses. Thus, Companies House triggered the process, which Wetzel characterized as “pretty standard” given the context. Furthermore, in the weeks since the purchase was confirmed, industry observers raised how Brian Lesser, CEO of WPP’s GroupM, was chief executive of InfoSum as recently as July of last year and whether this amounted to a conflict of interest. Digiday was told that Lesser was not part of the acquisition process for this reason. Instead, a team of technical execs oversaw the transaction and is held to the same degree of third-party oversight as any other, according to WPP. The agency network, once the undisputed heavyweight of media buying, has spent the last few years walking a tightrope: trying to modernize its infrastructure without unraveling the scale that made it powerful in the first place. The result has been a kind of strategy stutter. Internally, leadership changes have only deepened the disorientation. Over the past 18 months, the exits of GroupM’s CEO in North America, Kirk McDonald, followed by GroupM CEO Christian Juhl being replaced by Lesser a year later, have left staff unsure of who’s steering the ship and in which direction. Lesser, in particular, made waves upon his return, declaring to Adweek that within five years, “there is no human that touches a media plan.” It was meant to signal ambition, especially when paired with the familiar refrain that AI won’t take jobs, but people who use it will. For some inside GroupM, though, it landed less like a rallying cry, more like a warning — an aspirational soundbite that glossed over the day-to-day friction of a network still figuring out how to move forward. “It seemed like there was very little regard for the people who are actually running the agency, ” said the partner, echoing what they described as widespread frustration among colleagues and friends still inside the network in reaction to the quote. Outside the network, things aren’t much better. On the new business, the media group trails its rivals. Last year it ranked third behind Omnicom Media Group and Publicis in net new and retained client wins with a total value of $3.5 billion, according to COMvergence, a global research firm that tracks agency pitches. When accounting for that value without losses, it climbed to second place with $8.7 billion, still behind Omnicom. “Clients are really souring on WPP — they’re not interested in the new direction it’s on,” said a pitch consultant on condition of anonymity. “WPP has been dormant while its biggest rivals have been proactive. That’s had an impact on GroupM, which doesn’t seem to have an exciting story to tell clients in the way that Publicis Media does.” Lesser has defended the network’s performance, arguing it’s paying for sins of the past. He also noted that GroupM has actually beaten out Publicis more recently. “I think the notion that WPP is not competitive is a little bit overplayed and dramatic,” he told Digiday last week when the InfoSum deal was announced. He added, “If you look at some of our wins from late last year, whether that be Amazon, or Unilever — taking the commerce business back off Publicis, because Unilever was unhappy there — and winning J & J in a direct head-to-head with Publicis. I think that we are very competitive in the market. And frankly, when you look at our financial results, that has more to do with things that we’ve lost in the past, that we’re just feeling the after-effects of.” The irony is that for all the talk of reinvention, GroupM’s future seems increasingly straddled with the same issues as its past: a clunky operating model, an over-reliance on scale, and an uneasy relationship with the very technology it’s banking on to save it. Merkle president Pete Stein has streamlined Merkle to focus on three areas: CRM and loyalty, content and commerce, and data and analytics. He’s also brought in new leadership.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels as Chip Export Curb Set to Hit Earnings

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 7% Wednesday after the company said it’s set to take a $5.5 billion charge as a result of U.S. restrictions on exports of its AI chips to China. The company said via a regulatory filing that it would be required to have an export license to sell its popular H20 chips to China amid concerns they could be used by Beijing to build a supercomputer. The development caught market watchers off guard, given Nvidia designed the H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to comply with Biden-era chip export curbs on advanced chips the former administration thought could be used by foreign adversaries. Nvidia shares have staged a modest recovery above this month’s low but have lost about a firth of their value since the start of the year as of Wednesday’s close amid uncertainty over Washington's trade policies and big tech AI spending. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching out for. After attracting buying interest near the lower trendline of a falling wedge pattern last week, Nvidia shares rallied sharply before running into selling pressure near the pattern’s top trendline. It’s worth noting that although the stock fell sharply in Wednesday’s trading session, the price formed a doji, a candlestick pattern suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. Let’s identify key support and resistance levels on Nvidia’s chart that investors may be monitoring. Nvidia shares fell 6.9% to close Wednesday's session at $104.49. Further selling in the stock could initially see the price revisit support around $96. This area may attract buyers near last year’s prominent March twin peaks, a location on the chart also situated just above this month’s tariff-driven low. The bulls’ failure to defend the April low could trigger a larger drop to the $76 level. Investors may look for buy-and-hold entry points in this region near last April’s notable swing low. A volume-backed breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s top trendline could drive a move to around $130, currently just above the 200-day moving average. The shares may face overhead resistance in this area near the August peak and December trough. Finally, buying above this level could see Nvidia shares climb to $150. Investors may decide to lock in profits at this price near several peaks that formed on the chart just below the stock’s record high set in early January. This area also aligns with a projected measured move price target that calculates the depth of the falling wedge in points and adds that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, adding $40 to $110 forecasts an upside target of $150. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Markets sank sharply on Wednesday after back-to-back tariff-related headlines from Nvidia and the Federal Reserve rattled investor confidence. The sell-off started after a disclosure on Tuesday evening after markets closed from Nvidia, which warned of a $5.5 billion hit due to export rules on H20 AI chips developed for the Chinese market. Nvidia appears to be caught in the increasing tension over tariffs between the US and China. Stock losses deepened after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell cautioned that renewed tariffs under the Trump administration could create a "challenging scenario" for the economy. He warned that the Fed's dual mandate — low unemployment and price stability— could be tested if tariffs drive up consumer prices while slowing growth. Here is how much each of the Magnificent 7 lost on Wednesday — and since Trump's inauguration — at market closing at 4 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.51% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2% Alphabet, Google's parent company, took a comparatively smaller loss on Wednesday but still saw about one-fifth of its stock value wiped out since Trump became president. In February, Nvidia replaced Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company. Alphabet donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Loss in stock value since January 21: 22.16% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2.93% Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, has lost about one-fifth of its share value since Trump's inauguration and could be hit further by tariffs, especially the up to 245% in duties imposed on China. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, and founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos attended. Small businesses selling on Amazon told Business Insider they are struggling to keep their doors open as their already razor-thin margins shrink further under tariffs. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.21% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.89% Apple shares briefly rallied on Monday on a surprise tariff exemption on key tech products, but the reprieve was short-lived. The tech giant is also planning to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 15.40% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.68% Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is currently facing a blockbuster antitrust trial with the Federal Trade Commission that opened on Monday and is expected to run up to eight weeks. The tech giant had donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.98% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.66% Microsoft has been rethinking its performance reviews and is mulling another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, after already having fired "low-performers" in January. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.33% Loss in stock value on April 16: 6.87% A main character of Wednesday's stock market woes, Nvidia, the chipmaking giant, took a heavy loss in shares and at one point neared a 10% loss before bouncing back toward market close. The semiconductor maker developed H20 AI chips for China but disclosed Tuesday that new US export restrictions have effectively blocked Nvidia from selling the inventory, which weighed down share values of the broader tech sector. Loss in stock value since January 21: 40.08% Loss in stock value on April 16: 4.94% Tesla, the EV giant, had an especially difficult year in terms of sales and share value for reasons that go beyond tariffs or generally low consumer sentiments. Public backlash over Musk's political involvement and ties to the White House's DOGE office resulted in mass protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles, and his focus on DOGE made investors question his commitment to the company. Elon Musk has donated over $260 million to support Trump's return to the White House, along with $12 million toward a failed conservative bid in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Jump to

Title: PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan

Time Published: 2025-04-17T01:18:53Z
Full Content:
The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card. For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know. I wrote for the well-known tech site Tom's Hardware for three years before I joined PCMag in 2018. In that time, I've reviewed desktops, PC cases, and motherboards as a freelancer, while … PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card.
