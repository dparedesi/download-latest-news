Title: Top 10 Investment Themes For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/12/20/top-10-investment-themes-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T18:23:18Z
Full Content:
Will the bull market continue into 2025? Happy New Year, all. My overall macro theme for 2024 was An Expansion of the Rally. The theme ultimately proved to be accurate, as the dominance of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms) dissipated during the second half of the year as the other “Not So Magnificent 493” stocks (i.e., the remaining stocks of the S&P 500 Index) took over the leadership role. The Magnificent 7 accounted for 62% of the total return of the S&P 500 in 2023, and 59% during the first0 half of 2024, but just 9.2% during the third quarter of 2024. This passing of the baton is important, healthy and constructive for the continuation of the current bull market run, which is now over two years old, with a cumulative return of 74.2% as of November 29, 2024. For perspective on this front, prior to the current bull market, according to data from Yardeni Research and Yahoo! Finance, there have been 12 bull markets since 1946 and the average duration of those bull markets was 5.3 years, with an average cumulative return of 177.5%. Of course, this time could be different, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Stock market leadership was not the only significant transition that took place in 2024. The U.S. election concluded with a transition in the White House and Senate as the Republicans now control all three legs of the federal government stool, given that they also maintained control of the House of Representatives. Time will tell what this transition will mean in terms of policy implementations and their impacts on economic and stock market growth. The Federal Reserve also transitioned from an inflation-fighting, higher interest rate environment to the beginning stages of what will likely be a multi-year rate-cutting campaign. They kicked off the campaign with 100 bp (1%) in rate cuts towards the latter stages of 2024. According to the Fed's final 2024 release of their infamous "Dot Plot" chart in December, they are forecasting another 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2025 and 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2026. The Fed is also forecasting inflation, as measured by Core PCE, to decrease to 2.5% in 2025 and then decrease further to 2.2% in 2026. As a result, I see the theme for 2025 as Growth Opportunities Ahead. This theme does not imply that all areas of the market will move higher in the new year because they likely will not. It also does not mean the economy will experience exponential growth because it likely will not. Finally, it does not imply that periods of short-term bouts of volatility will not happen, as they likely will, given current valuations and the many geopolitical and central bank uncertainties that lie ahead. What it does suggest, however, is that the next four years will undoubtedly look very different than the prior four years, and the next decade will look very different than the last decade. Over the shorter term, the outlook for lower interest rates and inflation, coupled with expected economic growth and stability under a Trump Administration (with the support of Congress), provides tailwinds for potential growth opportunities in both equities and fixed income. However, while I see numerous growth opportunities ahead in 2025, investors would be wise to be selective as growth will likely be less than what the stock market experienced in the prior two years and more pronounced in certain areas of the market than others. Some of these areas are highlighted below. 1. Bull Market and Earnings Growth Expansion: For the breadth of the bull market to continue to expand, the breadth of the earnings rally also needs to expand. Fortunately, both of these expansions began during the second half of 2024, and I believe that the momentum will carry forward through 2025. In terms of earnings growth, according to FactSet, the per-share operating earnings growth pace for the overall S&P 500 Index is currently forecasted at 15%. As a result, expanding beyond, but not necessarily abandoning, U.S. large-cap stocks is worthy of consideration for the new year. Expansion candidates would include U.S. mid-cap, U.S. small-cap and international stocks (predominantly international developed market stocks) that pay attractive dividends, have a history of price performance, and are poised for total return potential ahead. 2. The Long Game of Artificial Intelligence Investing: In terms of where we are in the timeline of artificial intelligence (AI), I believe that we are just in batting practice of a double-header with so many more opportunities that lie ahead in the development and application of AI. According to Faist, as of June 11, 2024, the global AI market is expected to reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, with a 36.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, investors and companies need to be patient with their investments in this revolutionary technology, as some may not necessarily see a return on their investment for years to come. As I see it, the AI revolution road is a long one with many potholes that will create many winners and many losers. As a result, as opposed to just trying to find the next Nvidia or hot chips/semiconductor company, investors should consider potential investment opportunities in the entire AI Ecosystem, which is comprised of data centers, software, hardware and chips/semiconductors. Data centers and their associated tremendous need for power and cooling solutions, in particular, have become a critical component of the AI ecosystem. 3. Increased Investment in Defense and Security: U.S. defense and national security needs to focus on replenishment, upgrades and modernization, addressing gaps in naval readiness, advancing missile defense systems highlighted by recent conflicts, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like autonomous systems (i.e. drones) to meet evolving global threats. Fortunately, more spending is on the way as defense spending in the United States is predicted to increase every year over the next decade, totaling approximately $1.1 trillion in 2034–that represents an increase of over 20% vs. 2023 and 263% vs. 2000, according to Statista Research Department as of July 5, 2024. Companies that play a pivotal role in areas such as enhancing military readiness, advancing missile defense systems, and driving technological innovation in autonomous and defense technologies stand to benefit from the increases in investment and spending in these areas. 4. Fed Adopts More Gradual Pace toward Interest Rate Cuts: According to its updated Dot Plot chart (see below), the Fed is currently forecasting 50 bp in additional rate cuts in 2025 and another 50 bp in rate cuts in 2026. All this would follow the 100 bp in rate cuts that the Fed enacted during the latter stages of 2024. These cuts align with their long-run neutral rate expectation of around 3.0%. In terms of the pace of their cuts, I believe that the Fed will adopt a more gradual pace of easing in 2025 and 2026 with no single rate cuts of greater than 25 bp until the Fed Funds Target Rate is closer to their long-run neutral rate expectation of 3% (which may not be achieved by the end of 2026), given the many uncertainties surrounding the labor market, inflation, potential tariffs, and the policies to be implemented by the incoming administration. Regardless of the pace and extent of this rate-cutting campaign, it has become abundantly clear that interest rates will be lower in 2025 and over the next two years. As a result, investing in areas of the market likely to benefit from a declining interest rate environment is worthy of consideration. These areas may include, but are not limited to, certain sectors of equities, such as healthcare, information technology, consumer staples, financials, communication services and consumer discretionary, as well as bonds of different credit qualities, with an overweight towards investment grade. Federal Reserve "Dot Plot" Chart as of December 18, 2024 FOMC Dot Plot Chart December 18, 2024 5. Large Cap Pharma Turns to Small Cap Biotech for Answers: Large-cap pharmaceutical companies face multiple headwinds as they continue to have their profit margins pressured by Washington D.C.'s push to lower drug prices and larger revenue-producing drugs that have come off patent or are scheduled to see come off patent and be challenged by lower generic drug prices. One answer to their revenue quandary can be found in the innovative healthcare solutions being developed by smaller-cap biotech firms. These innovative healthcare solutions, which are now being assisted by artificial intelligence developments in certain cases, include but are not limited to gene therapies, RNA therapeutics, precision and target oncology treatments such as CAR-T cell therapies, and, of course, obesity drug breakthroughs such as GLP-1. In 2024, according to BioPharma Drive, as of November 26, there were 36 Biotech M&A transactions totaling just over $45 billion, the latter well below expectations coming into the year as many of the deals involved smaller companies. However, the average premium paid for the 36 transactions in 2024 was an impressive 83%. Looking ahead to 2025, many analysts are optimistic that the total number and total money amount of biotech-related M&A transactions will increase. To this end, PwC, in its "Pharmaceutical and life sciences: U.S. Deals 2025 outlook," expects transactions between $5 billion and $15 billion to see sustained activity in 2025 while recognizing geopolitical factors that could bring headwinds. Investors thus need to find those smaller-cap biotech companies with existing breakthroughs or innovative drugs in the FDA approval pipeline that large-cap pharmaceutical companies desire to add to their platforms and thus have the greatest chance of being acquired. Small-and mid-cap biotech companies with strong pipelines and focused therapies, such as rare diseases, RNA-based therapies or advanced immunology, according to Biopharma Boardroom, appear to have the most appeal to potential large-cap pharmaceutical acquirers in the current environment. Looking for those companies with related drugs in Phase II or Phase III of the FDA approval process is a good starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities. 6. Munis Poised to Perform: Tax free income is always attractive to income-oriented investors, particularly investors in higher tax brackets. I anticipate this level of attraction being heightened in 2025. Heading into the new year, the balance sheets of many local and state governments are relatively strong, and the positive outlook for employment and the economy in 2025 should bode well for the tax revenues of many municipalities. Additionally, comparable yields of municipal bonds are currently and should remain, very attractive to investors. According to data from Schwab* as of December 3. 2024, the tax-equivalent yield of munis for an investor in the top tax bracket is near its high over the past 15 years. Concerns over the potential repeal of the municipal bond exemption appear now to be overblown, setting the stage for what could be a high level of demand for municipal bonds and municipal bond-oriented strategies in the new year. Lower short-term interest rates should also benefit municipal closed-end fund (CEF) strategies that employ leverage, many of which are still trading at a discount to their net asset values (NAVs). 7. Financials (including Regional Banks) Rebound: Many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis and ensuing hangover have seemingly abated as short-term interest rates have declined (and are forecasted to decline further), the prices of U.S. Treasurys have increased, and the prospects for more economic growth and less regulation have increased following the election of Donald Trump. Less regulation and lower potential capital requirements could also lead to great industry consolidation via an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios. Best wishes for a productive and successful 2025! * Source: Schwab, Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/3/2024.

To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios.

Title: Databricks raises a cool $10B as the boom in AI models rages on

UPDATED 13:04 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof The bottomless pit of funding for all things artificial intelligence remains… bottomless. Case in point: This week Databricks raised more money than God. That’s going to be one monster IPO next year (maybe) if the economy holds up. Meanwhile, Perplexity raised $500 million for its AI search and immediately bought AI startup Carbon. And continuing the AI funding bubble boom, Sandbox AQ raised $300 million. But the business is real, as AI is expected to drive enterprise tech upside next year. The bubble boom in AI models is continuing too, as Google, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta and others all released new models and ways to use and access them. Salesforce also beefed up its just recently introduced AI agent platform Agentforce. But OpenAI faces legal headwinds as Elon Musk and Meta both opposed its plans to create a for-profit company. Neobank Chime filed confidentially for an initial public offering next year, following ServiceTitan’s IPO last week. Is a thawing in the works this winter? Dave Vellante and David Floyer have a plan to revive Intel’s chip foundry business, but it’s going to take a lot of cooperation by some powerful companies and the government. Cyber consolidation keeps chugging along, as Arctic Wolf bought BlackBerry’s Cylance unit and Cisco bought SnapAttack. Elsewhere in technology, TikTok’s bid to survive in the U.S. will go to the Supreme Court next month. Your guess as to what the Supremes will do is as good as mine. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod out today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive Breaking Analysis this weekend.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Archer Aviation (ACHR) and Joby Aviation (JOBY) are climbing 14% and 10%, respectively today. Yesterday Archer disclosed that it had received a certificate of occupancy for its factory in Georgia, while Joby reported today that the Federal Aviation Administration had completed a test of its aircraft. The companies are developing electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which are popularly known as eVTOLs. A futuristic electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft soaring through the sky. Yesterday Archer disclosed that it had earlier in the week received a certificate of occupancy for its 400,000-square-foot aircraft factory. Automaker Stellantis (STLA), Archer's partner, will also be involved with the management of the facility, Archer indicated. Specifically, the two companies are negotiating a deal that will involve Stellantis collaborating "with Archer as its exclusive contract manufacturer to mass produce Archer’s Midnight eVTOL aircraft at this facility.," Archer stated. Additionally, Stellantis will provide Archer with "capital, advanced manufacturing technology and expertise and experienced personnel." The two firms intend to manufacture 650 aircraft each year at the facility by 2030. As for Joby, the eVTOL maker disclosed that it had carried out a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test that's in a category called Type Inspection Authorization. Specifically, FAA pilots evaluated the aircraft's " flight safety using an FAA-conforming flight deck in a Joby simulator." the company reported. While we acknowledge the potential of ACHR and JOBY, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACHR and JOBY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wells Fargo departs climate banking group in another high-profile exit after Goldman

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has withdrawn from a group of global banks committed to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the number of high-profile firms exiting climate initiatives amid mounting political pressure. The bank has ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a spokesperson said on Friday, two weeks after another notable exit by Goldman Sachs. Financial firms, which have long been criticized for their ties to the fossil fuel industry, have tried to integrate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. But more recently, they have started to scale back some of those initiatives to avoid irking Republicans. GOP officials have cracked down on companies they view as climate-friendly. Last month, asset management giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were accused of violating antitrust law through climate activism in a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states. Wells Fargo, however, did not give a reason behind the move. "The alliance prefers not to see any bank leave but respects the decision Wells Fargo has made based on its own individual circumstances," an NZBA spokesperson said. The NZBA is a group of banks "committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050," according to its website. Since the UN-backed alliance was founded in April 2021, it has attracted over 100 banks while five have left, the group's spokesperson said. "The overall increase in membership indicates how important understanding climate risk and the transition to net zero has become to banks and companies around the world," they added. Wells Fargo's exit was first reported by Bloomberg News earlier on Friday. (Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri) Sign in to access your portfolio

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 800 points on Friday, buoyed by inflation data that helped the market rebound from the losses earlier this week. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is regarded as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose a modest 0.1% in November compared to the previous month. On an annual basis, the PCE price index reflected a 2.4% inflation rate — slightly above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%, but notably below analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.5%. The cooler inflation data is expected to ease concerns about persistent price pressures, raising hopes that the Fed may reduce interest rates more than twice in 2025. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 796 points or 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 1.8% each. AI stocks rebounded on Friday morning, emerging as the top-performing stocks. Nvidia (NVDA), which experienced a sharp sell-off earlier in the week, climbed 2.3%, trading at $133 per share. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Broadcom (AVGO) were up 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Bitcoin sunk below $92,000 early Friday before recovering some ground on the heels of the Federal Reserve signaling a slowdown in interest rate cuts for 2025. The leading cryptocurrency was hovering around $96,000 on Friday morning, down about 7.7% over the past day. Bitcoin has slumped more than 10% since the start of the week when it hit highs of more than $106,000. – Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Important AI News and Ratings for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynatrace, Inc.’s (NYSE:DT) stands against the other AI stocks. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have raised both opportunities and concerns, especially regarding its safety and the ethical implications of its widespread use. Establishing regulatory frameworks for AI is essential to ensure its responsible development, protecting against potential risks while maximizing its positive impact across industries. The Future of Life Institute released its 2024 AI Safety Index, evaluating the safety practices of leading AI companies including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, x.AI, and Zhipu AI among others. The review panel, consisting of prominent AI experts, found significant gaps in the companies' risk management and safety strategies, especially regarding their ability to ensure that advanced AI systems remain beneficial and under human control. Despite some positive steps in certain areas, the panel expressed concern that these companies are not adequately addressing the existential risks associated with AI development. The report highlighted the need for improved accountability, transparency, and safety frameworks, as competitive pressures seem to be overshadowing safety considerations. The index aims to provide the public with insights into AI companies' safety efforts and encourage better practices within the industry. READ ALSO: 10 Companies Hoarding Bitcoin Like There's No Tomorrow and 11 AI News That You Should Not Miss. In a CNBC interview, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and MIT professor, emphasized the need for AI safety standards, drawing a parallel to regulated industries like aviation and medicine. He highlighted the current lack of clear plans to ensure AI safety, especially as systems like chatbots and autonomous vehicles become more integrated into real-world applications. Tegmark advocates for policy changes to make AI companies prioritize safety, much like other industries, to prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. While the situation is concerning, he believes that proper regulation could lead to significant benefits. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company has been recognized as a Leader in both Cloud-Native Observability and Cloud-Native Security in the 2024 ISG Provider Lens report. The company earned top positions for its competitive strength and portfolio attractiveness, being placed at the highest point in the Cloud-Native Observability quadrant. Partha Chakraborty, Senior Lead Analyst at ISG Research commented: "By delivering critical AI-driven insights, Dynatrace sets a new standard for observability, enabling teams to better understand their IT environments. Additionally, the company has significantly advanced strategic industry relationships, solidifying its leadership in the security space. Leveraging the power of three AI techniques—causal, predictive, and generative—Dynatrace provides advanced protection against emerging risks, ensuring robust security for modern enterprises." Overall, DT ranks 7th on our list of important AI news and ratings for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

It also invests in early-stage AI innovations, advancing connectivity and intelligent computing across industries. As reported by Reuters on December 18, Qualcomm estimated potential annual savings of $1.4 billion in royalties to Arm by acquiring Nuvia, a startup purchased for $1.4 billion in 2021, as revealed during a Delaware federal court trial. CEO Cristiano Amon testified that the acquisition was justified by these projected savings and Nuvia’s critical role in Qualcomm’s strategy to strengthen its chip designs for PCs and smartphones, aiming to compete with Apple and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia after attempts to partner with the startup failed, leveraging its expertise despite Nuvia’s lack of a finished product and initial focus on servers. The trial involves Arm’s claim that Qualcomm used Nuvia’s technology without proper licensing consent. Overall, QCOM ranks 5th on our list of AI news that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While buzzwords like AI took center stage in 2024, millions of Americans kept collecting regular dividend checks to fight inflation and seek financial freedom.

The question received over 200 responses, but one answer stood out. In this comment, a Redditor said he retired at 35 in Southeast Asia and lives off dividend income from several funds. In a few other discussions, this investor said he is an Asian Australian who moved to Southeast Asia and lives off about $1,200 per month in income from the dividend funds he invested in. "Worked my guts out in my 20s, retired on a paradise beach in Southeast Asia in my 30s," he commented during a discussion on Reddit. "Honestly, it’s the best life, feels like a dream," he said on another occasion.

Title: Man secures €600,000 settlement over alleged brain injury from Christmas Day fall on sister’s driveway
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2024/12/20/man-secures-600000-settlement-over-alleged-brain-injury-from-christmas-day-fall-on-sisters-driveway/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T15:41:07Z
Full Content:
A financial consultant who alleged he fell and fractured his skull as he left his sister’s house on Christmas Day and ended up with a severe brain injury has settled a High Court action for €600,000. Anthony O’Riordan (81) was stretchered from the driveway of the house in Dalkey, Co Dublin after what is thought to have been a tumble as he attempted to get into a taxi on the driveway. His counsel, Bruce Antoniotti, instructed by Augustus Cullen Law, told the High Court Mr O’Riordan suffered a brain injury and has been left with cognitive deficits following the incident 12 years ago. Counsel said Mr O’Riordan had arrived with his wife and daughter at his sister’s house at 4pm on Christmas Day in 2012. The driveway where the fall allegedly occurred had a 9.5 degree slope. The O’Riordans were leaving about four hours later when he “disappeared from view” having apparently lost his balance after walking around the back of their taxi, counsel said. “We don’t know what happened and Mr O’Riordan does not remember the incident. We don’t know if he tripped, slipped or stumbled,” counsel said. The most likely explanation was that Mr O’Riordan stumbled, said Mr Antoniotti, noting the wing mirror of the taxi car broke off, which was consistent with somebody stumbling and grabbing the wing mirror. Mr O’Riordan, of Mount Merrion Avenue, Blackrock, had through his wife, Hilda, sued Irene and Robin Hennessy, of Knocknacree Road, Dalkey, over the incident. All of the claims were denied. He claimed he was negotiating the steep driveway and attempting to enter the taxi when he slipped and fell. He alleged there was a failure to ensure his safety, health and welfare while he was a guest on the premises and a failure to ensure that the cobble lock paving was cleaned with a power hose to ensure it was free from any build-up of grime liable to render the surface slippery, particularly in the winter months. It was alleged that Mr O’Riordan hit his head and was unconscious for about 20 minutes. He was diagnosed with a skull fracture and brain bleed that required surgery. Mr Antoniotti told the court that expert engineers on his client’s side were not critical of the driveway slope and said the rough surface was safe. A year and a half after the incident it was noted on inspection of the driveway that it was in pristine condition. Outlining the risk of further litigating the case, counsel said he had grave concerns and he could not say they would succeed if the case went to trial. Approving the settlement, Mr Justice Paul Coffey said there was no evidence as to how Mr O’Riordan fell and there was no criticism of the slope by the engineers. Noting the litigation risk, the judge said the offer was fair and reasonable. He said it must have been a very shocking event for the family and Christmas must now be a very difficult time for them. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A next-gen Ozempic falls short in a drug trial — and Novo Nordisk stock plunges 20%

Time Published: 2024-12-20T15:39:46Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO) released mixed clinical-trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Friday, leaving Wall Street disappointed. The pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, said its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug CagriSema fell short of expectations. The drug did not achieve the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by the company and analysts. Instead, patients in the phase 3 clinical trial lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s current weight-loss drug on the market, resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk stock fell over 20% on Friday morning following the news. CagriSema belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, which was made popular by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. That’s why several pharma companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss meds. Novo Nordisk was betting that by mimicking multiple hormones, it could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. Still, the trial did deliver some promising results. Novo Nordisk reported that 40.4% of patients taking CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 25% or more over the 68-week trial period. The company is expected to reveal results of a second phase 3 trial of the drug in the first half of 2025. Eli Lilly and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which are also developing next-gen weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 5% and 3%, respectively, on Friday.

Title: What's Next For FDX Stock?

A FedEx cargo flight arrives at Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport in Qingdao, east China's ... [+] Shandong Province, Nov. 11, 2024. TO GO WITH "Interview: FedEx Asia Pacific president upbeat about China's thriving logistics sector" (Photo by Li Ziheng/Xinhua via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) is expected to see higher levels after it announced the spin-off of its freight business. While this move was awaited, it bodes well for the stock, unlocking shareholder value. The division is estimated to be worth over $30 billion. [1] Although FedEx’s freight business accounted for only 10% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2024, it was far more profitable, with 20% operating margin, versus 2% for Express and 12% for the Ground segment. The spin-off will help FedEx focus on the core delivery business and improve its profitability. While FDX stock may see higher levels in the near term, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. FDX stock has fared well in recent years, with 66% gains since early 2023. This can be attributed to a 2x rise in the company’s trailing P/E ratio from 8x to 16x; partly offset by an 18% fall in adjusted earnings from $20.61 in 2022 to $16.92 now. The earnings decline is a result of lower revenues and margin contraction. FedEx’s revenue declined 6% from $93.5 billion in 2022 to $87.6 billion now, due to lower e-commerce volumes compared to the peak during the pandemic, rising costs pushing customers to cheaper alternatives, and a reduced international shipping demand, among other factors. The company’s adjusted net margin declined by 110 bps over this period due to higher operational costs, including labor and rentals. Notably, the increase in FDX stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 1% in 2021, -32% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the changes in the White House, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? After today’s expected rise following the spin-off development, we think FDX stock will be fairly priced. At levels of around $285, FDX stock trades at 17x trailing adjusted earnings of $16.92 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 16x over the last two years. Now, with the freight business spin-off, a rise in valuation multiple for FDX seems justified, and the stock may see higher levels. We currently estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, aligning with its current levels. We will soon update our model to reflect the impact of the spin-off. While FDX stock looks fairly priced, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

We recently published an article entitled Why These 10 Stocks Jumped Yesterday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Centessa Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ:CNTA) stands against the other stocks that jumped yesterday. Broader indices haven't been performing very well since the Fed's not so surprise revelation about the number of expected cuts in 2025. Nevertheless, several stocks on Thursday posted notable gains. Lab technicians in safety glasses and lab coats conducting a clinical trial of a new pharmaceutical. On Thursday, Centessa Pharmaceuticals (CNTA) finished the week stronger, with its share price posting a 6.3 percent increase to close at $17.55 apiece. According to news reports, analysts were bullish on the company’s stock price, receiving a higher price target from hedge funds. According to Leerink Partners, it upgraded its price target for the company to $24 apiece and maintained an “outperform” rating, reflecting an optimistic view on the company's ORX750 program, for the treatment of narcolepsy. Leerink Partners also raised its sales projections for Centessa's total sales by 4 percent to $1.3 billion in 2032, as well as its earnings per share by 18 percent to $5.21 from $4.42. Centessa similarly received a higher price target and a “buy” rating from financial services giant Guggenheim to $28, reflecting a positive outlook for the company. Overall CNTA ranks 8th on our list of the stocks that jumped yesterday. While we acknowledge the potential of CNTA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock is tumbling 21% today after individuals who received the company's experimental weight-loss drug shed many fewer pounds than expected. Specifically, the weight of patients who received Novo's anti-obesity drug, CagriSema, declined by an average of 20.4% in 68 weeks, versus the 25% average weight loss that Novo had expected the treatment to produce. A closeup shot of a laboratory technician handling a medical device used for fertility treatments. The company, however, stated that if all the patients who were tested had complied 100% with the treatment requirements, their mean weight loss would have been 22.7% and 40% of the trial participants would have shed at least 25% of their weight. Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Cencora (COR) ‘Always Wins’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cencora (NYSE:COR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of pills in a pharmacy, representing the high quality medications of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 45 Cencora (NYSE:COR) is one of the biggest pharmacy distributors in America. Recent events surrounding the pharma and healthcare benefits management industry have placed its shares on the backfoot. Cencora (NYSE:COR)'s stock up 6% over the past month as investors reevaluate consumer perceptions of the benefits industry. The sentiment surrounding its sector has not been helped by President-elect Trump's blunt statements of 'destroying' the healthcare middleman. On a firm-specific level, Cencora (NYSE:COR) has benefited from its portfolio of specialty drugs that help treat diseases like cancer. These drugs are pricier than other medications, and they enable pharmacies to post robust margins. Cramer believes that taking on giants like Cencora (NYSE:COR) will be quite hard as they've withstood similar attempts in the future. According to him: "Cencora. It used to be a, had a different name. You cannot attack Cencora. They are Teflon. Cencora always wins." Overall COR ranks 17th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of COR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock Prices May Fall On More Inflation, Slower Growth, Bitcoin Risk
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/12/20/stock-prices-may-fall-on-more-inflation-slower-growth-bitcoin-risk/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:51:45Z

With the U.S. government careening toward a shutdown this weekend and a key inflation report due today, stock futures — led by a 1% drop in Nasdaq-100 futures — were down, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this drop foreshadow declining stock prices in the next few years? Lacking a crystal ball, my prediction is yes. That’s because the scenario that strikes me as most likely will send stock prices down for four reasons: If you are not prepared to wait out a long period of stock market decline and a gradual recovery, taking equity profits could be a wise move. After two failed efforts to fund the government through March 2025; absent a deal today, the government could shut down at 12:01 a.m. on December 21. The economic consequences of such a shutdown would be significant. For example, “millions of federal employees and military service members” could be furloughed and Americans relying on federal assistance could face service disruptions, noted Seeking Alpha. Moreover, an extended government shutdown could cause flight delays since some TSA employees and air traffic controllers might call in sick, reported Axios. Leading the fall are technology stocks and bitcoin as investors await an inflation report that could send stocks down further. As semiconductor industry stocks — such as ASML, TSMC, AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia — fell, bitcoin’s price dropped 12% from its peak to $95,000, the Journal reported. Fortunately for bulls, a report on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures index — was better than expected. The PCE rose 0.1% in November — less than the expected 0.2%, according to CNBC. Some economists forecast tariffs imposed by President-Elect Donals Trump could revive inflation. Trump has announced a variety of tariff proposals — some linked to conduct of the countries whose goods would affected. During the election campaign, he pledged to impose 20% tariffs on all U.S. imports, reported the Journal. Following the November election, Trump also Executives of companies that import goods — which would likely be faced with higher costs when they pay the tariffs — have so far failed in their efforts to quash the Trump tariffs, noted the Journal. Economists envision tariffs could boost inflation. If tariffs push up consumer prices, businesses and individuals might be primed to react by hoarding products or paying more, they argue. Tariffs could go up “in the context of an economy where the embers of inflation are still smoldering,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told the New York Times. “It can rekindle.” On December 18, the Dow plunged 1,100 points after the Fed signaled fewer 2025 rate cuts than investors expected. If inflation rekindles, the Fed could stop cutting rates — or even raise them. “Today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting. He later added, “From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts,” according to the Wall Street Journal, Investors did not take into account how the Fed’s forecast might change in light of the election results. One economist concluded the Fed’s slower rate of interest rate cuts was a result of uncertainties related to tariffs and immigration policies. “This wholesale change in their views are clearly tied to uncertainty and risks around as-yet-enacted tariff and immigration policies and have far less to do with changes to the economic landscape,” Inflation Insights Founder Omair Sharif told the Journal. Economists are uncertain about the rate of economic growth. “It is a very uncertain outlook, and most of that uncertainty comes from potential changes in policy,” Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen told the Times. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street economists forecast gross domestic product growth will slow from 2.5% in 2024 to 2% in 2025. While rising stock prices and higher home prices could boost consumer spending — which accounts for 70% of economic growth, tariffs and stricter immigration policies could increase prices. Such stagflation — slower growth and higher prices — is the worst case scenario of one economist. “Trade and immigration policy could be extremely disruptive to the economy,” American Enterprise Institute economist Michael Strain told the Times. Strain envisions a stagflation scenario in which prices — of imported goods, groceries, restaurant meals, and homes — rise as economic growth slows. The reason? “Steep new tariffs discourage investment, mass deportations limit employers’ ability to find workers and mounting deficits drive up borrowing costs,” reported the Times. Finally, just as subprime mortgage-backed securities found their way into the financial mainstream — contributing to the 2008 financial crisis — there is a risk of bitcoin and other risky tokens doing something similar in the future. Bitcoin more than doubled in 2024 and popped 40% since November 5 on “hopes that a second Trump administration will usher in a golden age for digital currencies,” reported the Wall Street Journal. Individual investors are pouring cash into exchange traded funds linked to cryptocurrencies. Such ETFs — notably from Fidelity and BlackRock — have attracted $36 billion of new money since their launch — with their assets totaling about $116 billion, the Journal noted. ETFs get paid to accumulate assets in classes investors desire. “Asset managers’ jobs are to build products where there is demand from their clients so they can charge fees on it,” ETF Action Founder Mike Akins, told the Journal. “Let us not forget they also had no problem packaging up subprime mortgages and delivering them to their clients.” Could the inherent volatility of bitcoin and other risky tokens clip those investors’ wings and cause another financial crisis? The involvement of Fidelity and BlackRock gives me little comfort about the safety of bitcoin as an investment. After all, Akins’ comment reminds me how Lehman Brothers — which accumulated a highly leverage portfolio of subprime mortgage-backed securities — was a respected investment bank until Sept. 15, 2008 when it filed a $639 billion bankruptcy. The median Wall Street forecast sees a 9% rise in the S&P 500 in 2025, according to MarketWatch. While I hope I am wrong, tariffs, inflation, higher-than-expected interest rates, slower economic growth, and bitcoin volatility risk could make that forecast look overly optimistic. One Community.

Years ago, these index reconstitutions had very little impact on trading. Not anymore. The explosion of index-based ETFs has changed all that. Today, roughly $16 trillion is indexed to the S&P 500. The largest Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), has $321 billion in assets, and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Index mutual fund (IVNQX) has about $100 billion in assets, so we are talking well north of $400 billion in additional assets pegged to the Nasdaq-100. Bottom line: what stocks are added to or deleted from these large indexes matters a lot. If you doubt that being included in a large index matters, just ask Palantir Technologies. It apparently believes it is very important. On November 14, the company issued a three-sentence (!) press release announcing that it was transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market. Palantir concluded with this: "Upon transferring, Palantir anticipates meeting the eligibility requirements of the Nasdaq-100 Index." Can't make it any plainer than that. And Palantir got its wish. It's being added to the Nasdaq-100 at the close of trading on Friday. Two companies are being added to the S&P 500: Apollo Global Management and Workday. Qorvo and Amentum are being removed. Most people think the S&P 500 is the 500 largest companies in the United States, but it's more complicated than that. There are a number of requirements that have to be met to get into the S&P 500, including a minimum market capitalization of $18 billion. However, there is no obligation to mechanically include only the 500 largest companies by market capitalization: "Constituent selection is at the discretion of the Index Committee and is based on the eligibility criteria," S&P Global's methodology paper says. For S&P, adding Apollo (financials) and Workday (technology) are relatively safe choices. At $96 billion and $70 billion in market cap, both are squarely in the large-cap segment of the market. Still, many investors were hoping that Coinbase Global, which has a similar market cap to Workday ($68 billion) would be added to the S&P 500. It certainly qualifies based on market capitalization and profitability (it's been profitable the last four quarters). But Coinbase is a far more volatile stock than either Apollo or Workday. Coinbase did not make the cut. It's not clear why, but perhaps because the S&P Index Committee was concerned about the volatility. Coinbase is one of the most volatile of all stocks. This year alone, it has moved from a low of $117 to about $350, a 200% move. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but Coinbase was down 9% the day after the S&P inclusion announcement was made, and the cryptocurrency platform was excluded. Sometimes just determining where a stock should be classified can be a big issue, especially when big money is involved. Going into the Nasdaq-100 are MicroStrategy, Palantir and Axon Enterprise. Going out are Illumina, Super Micro Computer and Moderna. To enter the Nasdaq-100, a company has to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market, have a free float of at least 10% and, while there is no minimum or maximum market capitalization requirement, the annual reconstitution (determining who goes in and out), is loosely based on market capitalization: "The Nasdaq-100 Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies," Nasdaq says in its Index Methodology paper. Note the requirement that any entrant be a "non-financial stock." Based on market capitalization, MicroStrategy has certainly earned its spot in the Nasdaq-100. It has been a monster this year, up over 400%, and now sports a market cap of about $80 billion. That alone would put MicroStrategy in the top half of the Nasdaq-100 by market value. Like Coinbase, it is a very volatile stock (trading range in 2024: $50 to $500). More interesting is the fact that MicroStrategy is listed as a technology stock, but given that about half its value is in bitcoin (it owns 439,000 bitcoin with a current value about $42 billion), is it accurate to call it a tech stock? Chairman Michael Saylor has said he wants to run MicroStrategy as a "bitcoin bank." Should we take him at his word? Should MicroStrategy be classified as a financial stock, which would make it ineligible to be in the Nasdaq-100? For the moment, it's classified as a technology stock. Whether it stays there is uncertain. There's this thing called the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), which is the system developed to categorize public companies into specific industries and sectors. There are periodic reviews to make sure companies are in their appropriate sectors. But that is for another day. For the moment, Bitcoin fans are loving it. Their darling is in the Nasdaq-100. Whether index fans will love it is yet to be determined. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: A Teenager’s Lawsuit: Taking on the Global Food Giants. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:03:02Z

In a bold move, 18-year-old Bryce Martinez from Pennsylvania has taken a stand against some of the world’s largest food corporations. Martinez has filed a groundbreaking lawsuit against 11 major food companies, including household names like Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Kraft Heinz, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. This legal action brings to light the growing concern over UPFs, which are foods that have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients. These products, ranging from sugary cereals to packaged snacks and soft drinks, have become staples in many households, particularly appealing to children and teenagers. Martinez’s lawsuit argues that these companies have engaged in practices reminiscent of the tobacco industry, prioritising profits over the health of young consumers. His legal team contends that the food giants have exploited children’s vulnerability to marketing and their natural preference for sweet and salty flavours. It argues that these companies have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses, making it difficult for young consumers to resist or moderate their intake. The case details Martinez’s personal story, describing how he regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood, unaware of the potential long-term health consequences. His diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at 16 came as a shock, prompting him to investigate the root causes of his health issues. This lawsuit raises important questions about the food system in the face of rising childhood obesity and diabetes rates. It challenges the food industry’s long-standing defence that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. Martinez’s lawyers argue that when it comes to children, this notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics and the addictive nature of these products. The case also highlights the growing awareness of the link between diet and long-term health outcomes. Public health advocates have long warned about the potential dangers of a diet high in UPFs, but this lawsuit brings these concerns into the legal arena in an unprecedented way. The case draws parallels to the landmark tobacco lawsuits of the past, which resulted in significant changes to how cigarettes were marketed and sold. If successful, Martinez’s lawsuit could have similar far-reaching implications for the food industry, potentially leading to stricter regulations on food marketing, more transparent labelling practices and a shift in public perception of UPFs. Moreover, this case may inspire other individuals or groups to take similar legal action, potentially opening the floodgates for a wave of lawsuits against food companies. This could force coopted governments and the industry to reckon with their role in the global obesity epidemic and other diet-related health issues. While Martinez’s lawsuit focuses on the direct health impacts of UPFs on individuals, it’s crucial to understand this case within the broader context of the global food system. This is something I have been drawing attention to for many years, offering a critical lens through which to examine how the industrial food system, driven by profit motives, perpetuates health crises, environmental degradation and socio-economic harm. The rise of UPFs is emblematic of a food system shaped by capitalist imperatives. These foods, often laced with harmful chemicals and produced using toxic agrochemicals, are not only detrimental to health but also highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are deeply intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where corporations profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases caused by these products—a ‘win-win’ scenario for them but a devastating one for public health. A complex web of influence shapes global food policies and scientific research. Any talk about corporate influence and lobbying must include the role of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Despite claiming to be an independent scientific organisation, the ILSI functions as a powerful lobby group for the food industry. The ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders, often at the expense of public health. We have a food system where corporate lobbying exerts significant influence over policies and ensures harmful practices remain largely unchecked. The proliferation of UPFs has been linked to rising rates of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, exacerbating these health issues. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. High-level ‘experts’ and scientists with ties to major food corporations have argued against demonising UPFs, despite overwhelming evidence linking them to poor health outcomes. Addressing the harms caused by UPFs requires more than individual lawsuits — it demands a rethinking of how food is produced, marketed and regulated. Bryce Martinez’s lawsuit against food corporations represents a critical challenge to a system that thrives on ‘sickening profits’. This case is part of a larger struggle against a global food system that prioritises corporate wealth and power over health and food sovereignty. Whether through legal action or the work of grassroots movements, dismantling and rejecting this harmful system is essential for creating a healthier and more equitable future. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Middle East – Towards Endless Chaos?
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/middle-east-endless-chaos/5875360
Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:00:45Z
Full Content:
With the Ashkenazi-Zionist-Israel rapid expansion towards a Greater Israel, the sudden fall of Syria, the silence of Iraq, Iran scared to intervene, when Russia is folding up its tents in Syria and is getting the hell out of there — what else, but chaos? See also this analysis by Paul Craig Roberts. Well, the West’s unquestioned support for Israel, or what is still called Israel, though in the hands of mass murderers going by the name of Ashkenazi-Zionist – no original Jews, what can be expected from the region, other than an ever-faster downfall into full chaos? Chaos is usually what the rulers want. That is what Washington manages best. The US-Pentagon-NATO have a long history of letting chaos reign for control. This time though it seems to be different. The chaos is happening because of the West’s collective inaction; possibly negligence of their own interests. Just to be sure, Syria has not collapsed because of an “internal” civil war. There NEVER was a civil war; a civil war as we know by its true term where the local people rise up against their ruler. That never happened. Never listen to western media, which would like you to believe that Bashar al-Assad was fighting against a country full of Syrians who disliked him. That is a load of bull***t, as strong as it comes. Mr. al-Assad’s Syria was infiltrated since before the year 2000, still during his father Hafez Assad’s reign by US-UK-Israeli created terror groups, which lasted up to this day, plus new ones, to which Turkey later also contributed. Today they are called ISIS, IS, al-Qaeda, and finally by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or “Nusrah Front,” al-Qaeda’s former branch in Syria. For sure there are others. For now, HTS seems to be in control of Syria, if anybody is. Turkey, the flip-flop nation, a so-called NATO heavyweight claiming to be also friends with Russia – but when it comes down to it, Turkey under Erdogan is a traitor of everyone. Erdogan has dreams of grandeur, to bring back the Ottoman Empire. Should he ever be trusted? Washington wanted to dominate Syria for decades. Why? Her oil riches are much larger than is being officially estimated, her geographic strategic situation is unique to control the region – and not least, Syria is part of the Zionists’ dream of becoming the Greater Israel, the Land for the Chosen People. One can only wonder, what kind of God would choose such horrifying people? Syria is central to the downfall of the entire Middle East. That descent into chaos has started long ago, but accelerated to warp speed in the past weeks. It may go on for an undetermined period of time. It will affect Iran, though Iran, a new BRICS country and part of the Chinese Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), is expected to have Russian and Chinese support. However, recent events have shown that none of this can be taken for granted. So, for practical reasons Iran is on her own, internally still torn apart between the adherents of western values and those who trust the east. Of course, the western faction is heavily paid, infiltrated and trained by CIA and associated secret services to foment resistance and, if needed, facilitate assassinations of (western) undesirable leaders. And what about the Saudis? They are selling their hydrocarbons to China in Yuan, an indication that they would lean towards the East, China. However, when a year ago they were offered a place in the new BRICS, though they had officially accepted, but as of today they have not fulfilled any of the conditions laid out for the BRICS members. For example, they are adamant not letting go of the US dollar, not meaning de-dollarization, but trading among each other in their respective currencies. De-dollarization was never a condition for BRICS membership. But the sheer fact of being a member of the BRICS, pulling them closer to China and Russia, scares them. Remember, they are full with US military bases – a tit-for-tat – when they agreed in the 1970s as head of OPEC to trade hydrocarbons only in US dollars, Washington promised to “protect” them from potential enemies by dotting their country with US bases. The very bases from which the US is aggressing her chosen enemies, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world. The population of the Middle East is about half a billion people (2024 estimate), and growing. That is only about 6% of the world’s population but extremely rich in natural resources, including energies. . . Does anybody expect these people just to let go, being overrun and their resources – the world’s energy – being stolen by supremacists, who call themselves the Chosen People, without a fight? Not likely. What incoming President Trump will do to bring Peace to the Middle East is anybody’s guess. From the supposed key positions to be confirmed, with responsibilities for the Middle East, including his VP and Secretary of State – and others of course – the course of unquestioned support for Israel, or let’s call it by the true name, the Ashkenazi-Zionists, seems guaranteed. Mr. Trump has not made any indication that he wants Peace with Iran. That pits East against West in the Middle East which controls as it is today, between 55% and 60% of all known hydrocarbon reserves. Many countries around the globe depend on these reserves. For the foreseeable future the world’s economies are not going to be run by alternative “renewable” energy, like windmills or solar panels. By now, most people know that this is a joke. The climate hoax behind it is also about to collapse. The Green Deal people will soon get a hefty blow. Financial giants like BlackRock / Vanguard are clearly distancing themselves from this lie. Syria was a shining light in the region. But for most, she was unexpectedly overrun with apparent ease. All prepared for over 30 years, already when Hafez al-Assad was in power, the US started meddling. They intensified their interference in the early 2000 with a supposed pipeline from Qatar through Syria, which was probably planned by the US in connivance with Qatar, knowing that Syria would never allow it to protect her ally’s, Russia, gas market in Europe. But it gave the US yet another argument to further destabilize Syria. Chaos, upheaval and destruction; murdering of the worst kind in Syria of anybody who can still be linked to Bashar al-Assad. Human rights abuse, torture no end. Listen to this remarkable discussion between Mike Robinson and Vanessa Beeley about the events of the past week in Syria, including Vanessa’s escape from the terrorists (50-min podcast): Alternatively, you may listen here. The west is cheering, and the rest of the world is just looking on. Now the total downfall, total chaos of the Middle East is almost a given. Will Trump want to find a solution? The world needs a peace-loving leader from the East or from the West. Not a globalist, because globalists want Power not Peace. The current chaos is what the west wants – the US, UK, Europe, Israel and even Turkey. But it is doubtful that chaos in the Middle East would be in the long-term interest of the self-proclaimed masters of the universe. Somalia may be a good example of man-made chaos and kept as continued chaos. For decades Somalia has followed a similar pattern as is now inflicted in the Middle East. When it gets out of hand, and risks to spread to other areas and countries, inconvenient to the west, the US air force comes in on a flash, dropping a few bombs until the chaos becomes normal and manageable again. Will President Trump leave Syria to the old terror groups set up by the US et al. in the first place – and new ones to be created, which arm themselves largely from the weapons shipments to Ukraine, of which at least 70% goes directly to the black market, already reported on over a year ago by BBC and CNN? Some analyst-pundits predict that 30 to 50 years from now, the Middle East may become a nuclear-contaminated, uninhabitable, literally untouchable piece of land. Let us hope this can be avoided. If a genuine peace-leader, either from the west or the east, were to intervene in the Middle East by stopping the Zionists’ march towards a Greater Israel, restoring old frontiers, giving back Palestine to the Palestinians, there is a chance that the Middle East could become a viable partner to the rest of the world — with the hydrocarbon reserves continuing driving the world economy, towards a civilization of shared values and shared benefits. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Nvidia’s (NVDA) Run:AI Deal Isn’t A ‘Killer Acquisition’, says EU

Nvidia just received good news from Europe as The European Commission approved its acquisition of the Israeli firm Run:ai. The acquisition was announced in April but received a setback when European regulators took notice in October and decided to investigate the merger. Almost all tech companies continue to be under heavy scrutiny of late as regulators don’t want a handful of companies to take control of global technological development, especially at a time when a sensitive technology like Artificial Intelligence is in the early stages of development. In this particular case, it was the Italian regulators that flagged the buyout, using what they refer to as a ‘killer acquisition’ card (Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulations). A killer acquisition, according to the commission, is when a large company buys out a smaller company with the intention of shutting down the target company’s innovation or preventing it from becoming a future competitor. This is a complex issue in Europe and one that is likely to be heard more often than before in the future. But for now, Nvidia is safe and can go ahead with the buyout. The investigation was based on whether the acquisition would disrupt the GPU supply and GPU orchestration software market. As things stand, the startup doesn’t have any significant market share in the orchestration software market. An orchestration software plays the same role as the conductor in an orchestra. It helps manage and automate interactions between various components of a data center, including servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and applications that are running on the data center. The commission also noted that customers will still be able to access the services of Run:ai’s competitors. Even though the details of the deal were never made public, a rough estimate of the acquisition cost stands at $700 million. Nvidia will now be able to reduce the number of GPUs needed to complete a task by making multiple workloads run in parallel using Run:AI’s software. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pointed to another rough day on Wall Street Friday after the House of Representatives voted against a Trump-backed spending bill, further increasing the odds of a US government shutdown this weekend. Investors also digested key inflation data that showed a deceleration in price increases during the month of November after the Federal Reserve lowered the number of cuts it expects next year. Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

After multiple delayed reviews, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally given its regulatory greenlight the first spot exchange-traded funds tracking both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The approval extends the access of traditional institutional investors to the two largest crypto assets through spot-based investment products. According to a Dec. 19 notice, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Hashdex Crypto Index US ETF, which will trade on the Nasdaq stock market. The Wall Street top financial cop also greenlighted the Franklin Crypto Index ETF to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. “The proportion of bitcoin and ether to be held by each Trust will be based on free-float market capitalizations,” the notice reads. Franklin Templeton’s updated filing, submitted earlier on Wednesday, was approved on an “accelerated basis” due to compliance with existing commodity-based trust share structures. The SEC also stated that the proposals satisfied the criteria of the Exchange Act, which requires ETF providers to have sufficient rules to deter fraudulent and manipulative actions and protect investors, among other requirements. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, observed in an X post that it would be “interesting” to see if other issuers, including Wall Street giant BlackRock, will seek to introduce similar investment products following the SEC’s recent approval. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” Geraci added. The regulatory green light comes amid a Federal Reserve-spurred crypto market rout. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen over 7.5% on the day to $94,301 as of press time. Solana’s SOL, ETH, and Cardano’s ADA have dropped as much as 17.2%. Meanwhile, the OG meme coin Dogecoin has tumbled by 20.6% over the last 24 hours at a current price of around $0.2861.

Title: How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65

The Nvidia Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... [+] United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock fall by about 50% to levels of around $65 in the near term from the roughly $130 level it is at currently? We believe this is a real possibility. Nvidia has seen its business boom, led by the surging demand for its graphics processing units which have emerged as the de facto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications. However, there are multiple risks on the horizon. These include a potential cooling of AI training-related demand, mounting competition, and less attractive valuation multiples assigned by investors, due to slowing growth and less favorable monetary policy. We spell out the key risks for Nvidia in more detail and break down how the stock could fall by over 50% from current levels by looking at three metrics, namely the company’s revenue growth, margins, and price-to-earnings multiple. See our counter scenario on Nvidia Stock upside to $300. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. While AI has been all the rage, quantum computing could be the next big thing. See What’s Driving D-Wave Quantum Stock? and also Palantir Stock: Buy, Sell, Or Hold? Nvidia’s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia’s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, growth is slowly cooling off. Nvidia’s sales expanded by about 122% in the most recent quarter. There remains a possibility that growth could cool further with sales potentially even declining versus current levels in the medium term. Here’s why. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the considerably front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments yet. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see capital spending on GPU chips cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The long-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. To be sure, Nvidia may well remain the leader by far in inferencing as well, but there’s certainly an opening for rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain market share with chips such as AMD’s MI300 chips or Intel’s Gaudi AI accelerators. Nvidia’s top-end chips such as the H100 might be considered as overkill for simpler inference tasks, considering their high power consumption and upfront cost. There are signs that the big supply-demand mismatch seen through the early phase of the generative AI wave is easing. Microsoft which is Nvidia’s largest customer for GPUs, recently indicated that it was no longer supply-constrained for GPUs. The fact that Nvidia’s largest customer has sufficient chips to run its AI efforts suggests that the frantic “fear-of-missing-out” phase of GPU demand may be well behind us. Moreover, if demand stabilizes due to the above factors just as supply catches up, Nvidia may face pricing pressures or slower sales growth particularly if large customers rethink their inventory requirements. Now Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this year (FY’25) to about $129 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 10% over the next two years, due to the factors above, revenue could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to just about $165 billion in FY’27. Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY’19 to about 49% in FY’24 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia’s net income change. However, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are Nvidia’s biggest customers - are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. Competition will make Nvidia’s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. Earlier this month, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. Amazon is also marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that it uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as searching. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business and margins. Should you Sell Nvidia and buy Intel Stock? The gains from NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and potential changes in the AI landscape, what’s the downside for Nvidia stock? If we combine about 1.2x revenue growth (up 20%) between FY’25 and FY’27, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30% from current levels, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by about 15% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 15%, the P/E multiple is bound to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia’s position as a growth stock. Moreover, changes to U.S. monetary policy could also impact high multiple tech stocks to an extent. During its meeting earlier this week, the Central bankers signaled a slower pace of rate cuts ahead. Policymakers reduced the number of quarter-point cuts they expected for 2025, from an average of four back in September to just two presently. This could be a sign that the era of very low interest rates seen through Covid-19 is behind us. If Nvidia’s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 44x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock to about $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3 - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia’s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction.

Title: How innovation died at Intel: America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer faces an uncertain future and lawsuits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel's (INTC) fall from grace seemed to happen all at once. Shares of the once iconic chipmaker plummeted 60% in 2024. The company posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report. Its market cap has dropped 80% since 2000 — when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world. In November, an ascendant Nvidia (NVDA) replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A month later, CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned after taking the helm in February 2021. And on Wednesday the company was hit with yet another lawsuit filed by shareholders — this time seeking damages related to substantial losses from its struggling foundry division. But company insiders and industry analysts tell Yahoo Finance that Intel's dramatic crash is the result of a slow deterioration spanning more than two decades. “They had a God complex; they were super arrogant,” a former high-level executive who worked at Intel for more than 20 years told Yahoo Finance. “They felt like they had such a large competitive advantage that they could never do anything wrong.” The cause of Intel’s decay? A culture of complacency, short-term thinking, and lack of execution, all while its rivals got better. Today, Intel is hemorrhaging share in the very market it created, losing customers to AMD (AMD), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance. The x86 architecture underpinning Intel and AMD's products is, in turn, losing share to British chip designer Arm (ARM), according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Those chips altogether — CPUs, or central processing units — are existentially threatened by the rise of AI-focused GPUs, or graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia. And its fledgling foundry business is bleeding cash while competitors snatch fat contracts leveraging machine technology that Intel once funded. In 2024, Nvidia's stock is up 173%, while Arm, Broadcom (AVGO), and TSMC (TSM) clocked 93%, 101%, and 92% gains, respectively. Yahoo Finance spoke with half a dozen Wall Street analysts and experts and more than a dozen current and former employees (including high-level executives who were at the company for over a decade) for an inside look at Intel's failures and its future as America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. The employees were granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Intel spokesperson said, "We are executing with rigor on our plan to rebuild product and process leadership and improve our profitability. The work we are doing to strengthen our product portfolio, combined with our disciplined focus on driving returns on our foundry investments, supports our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable financial performance and unlock shareholder value.” As the rise of Arm-based chips and AI GPUs eroded Intel's standing, Pat Gelsinger promised to turn things around by launching a foundry business — leveraging Intel's manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers. The move was intended to bring back bold, innovative thinking — a "Grovian" mindset, referring to its famed former CEO Andy Grove. Some say it was Gelsinger’s best bet. “I think it's the right move because without looking outside the company and pursuing external customers, it's a shrinking company,” Hari said. Others were skeptical of the approach. Multiple analysts and insiders said the decline of Intel’s product business handcuffed its ability to fund Gelsinger’s aggressive capital spending and hiring sprees — which gave way to layoffs that depressed morale. Several employees commended what they described as Gelsinger’s brilliance and good character: One posted on LinkedIn about Gelsinger helping his grandson access medications to treat a fatal genetic disease. Others contended that Gelsinger set expectations too high, then acted more as a cheerleader than executor and refused to listen to input that didn’t align with his vision. Gelsinger’s stated target when he became CEO was to have Intel’s foundry generating $15 billion in revenue by 2030 — roughly double the $8.5 billion Samsung generated last year after nearly two decades of operation, according to Gartner data cited by Rasgon. In its most recent quarter, Intel’s net loss totaled $16.6 billion due to substantial losses in its chip manufacturing division. “Intel has not demonstrated that they can execute on foundry … because they don't have a track record and the track record that you've seen from their internal execution has been so flawed,” KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. “It's hard for anyone to commit any major mission-critical applications for them. And as a result of that, Intel is not going to pick up any sort of meaningful business.” Its last hope to right a sinking ship has been called into question. Under Gelsinger, Intel staked its fate on a new advanced manufacturing process called 18A — which the company’s corporate vice president Bruce Andrews told the Financial Times in November would “bring [the company] back to technological leadership.” The process would allow Intel to manufacture the most advanced AI chips with tiny components tens of thousands of times smaller than the size of a human body cell. Intel initially said it would begin high-volume production with its 18A process in the first half of 2025, then moved that target to the second half of next year, according to its third quarter earnings call. Internal testing of 18A earlier this year reportedly showed it wasn’t ready for high-volume production. A current employee at one of Intel’s fabs told Yahoo Finance there are “a lot of issues” making chips with the 18A process. They said that Intel is not ready to take on external customers and that communications between teams that should take days often take weeks as employees avoid responsibility for mishaps. Intel declined a request to comment on 18A, but pointed to recent commentary from its temporary co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus stating that 18A is on track to roll out by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, Intel has already purchased at least $760 million worth of machinery for its successor manufacturing process to 18A, called 14A. Gelsinger was ousted on Dec. 1 by Intel’s board, which has been criticized as “extremely weak” and lacking “hardened semiconductor people” by sources Yahoo Finance spoke to. Notably, the board added two leading semiconductor experts days after Gelsinger's exit. Intel’s technology is, in large part, responsible for the digital revolution. Its co-founder Bob Noyce has the greatest claim to the founding of Silicon Valley, according to semiconductor expert Chris Miller, author of “Chip War.” The company invented the world’s first microprocessors (i.e. computer chips) and the x86 architecture (a critical blueprint for designing computer chips). Its other co-founder, Gordon Moore, created “Moore’s Law,” a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. But after the dot-com bust, Intel invested in multiple projects that never materialized or failed to reach their potential. Two former executives told Yahoo Finance that innovative efforts were often killed if they didn't immediately contribute to revenue or risked cannibalizing existing products. One former high-level executive, who worked within several divisions, said Intel didn't support the team working on low-power Atom chips for mobile phones in the early 2000s. It sold its license for Xscale, then Arm's most advanced architecture for mobile chips, to Marvell (MRVL) in 2006. Paul Otellini, who served as CEO from 2005 to 2013, also passed on making chips for the initial Apple iPhone. Instead, Intel bet on Nokia — “a spectacular failure in terms of strategic decision making,” a former executive said. Its manufacturing division opted to use a technique called multiple patterning rather than investing in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines, which use incredibly complex technology from Dutch company ASML (ASML) that was only made possible by funding from Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s. TSMC and Samsung (005930.KS) successfully adopted EUV lithography first, vital to today's advanced chipmaking. Meanwhile, a former high-level executive said Intel had 10 EUV machines worth more than $1 billion in 2019 that it wasn't fully utilizing. Six former executives pointed to poor leadership as the source of many problems. They said Gelsinger's predecessors Brian Krzanich (known as “BK”) and Bob Swan prioritized short-term thinking over long-term technology strategies. The two served from 2013 to 2018 and 2018 to 2021, respectively. Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, it scrapped a project codenamed Larrabee, led by then-chief technology officer Gelsinger, which aimed to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD’s graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU. Three former executives say Koduri had a strong vision but was weak on execution. Koduri told Yahoo Finance, "As member of executive leadership team, I did bear the accountability of overall execution. Being criticized given my responsibility is true but, given the factors at play, is unkind to the engineering team that executed against all odds." At the same time, Intel acquired Habana Labs to develop another type of AI chip called an ASIC accelerator. But the effort wasn't prioritized due to internal politics, according to an executive who helped oversee the acquisition. “Their focus on Nvidia, who is the real enemy, was simply not there,” the source said. “They were like …crabs fighting amongst themselves.” To add insult to injury, Intel missed opportunities to acquire Nvidia and invest in OpenAI. Meanwhile, rivals were improving rapidly. TSMC began manufacturing iPhone chips in 2014, and Apple ditched Intel after creating its own MacBook chips using Arm's architecture. Nvidia spent nearly two decades developing the technology used in its AI chips before they took off in earnest. ASML spent 17 years creating its EUV lithography systems that gave it an effective monopoly over the tech required to make Nvidia chips. By the time generative AI sparked a new era of tech boom, Intel had been left in the dust. Chipmaking is becoming an increasingly important national security issue as US-China relations deteriorate. The US government is betting on Intel, sinking nearly $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding into the company’s existing and future foundries. But the money adds to Intel's conundrum: Its product business would be better off outsourcing all chipmaking to TSMC, Hari said, but that would leave its manufacturing division with no revenue. Analysts from Citi, KeyBanc, Raymond James, and others say Intel should spin off or divest its foundry business, but it has to maintain a 50.1% stake to keep its CHIPS Act funding. “There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the [CEO] slot looks in for a tough ride,” Rasgon wrote in a client note. Intel's revenue for the upcoming quarter is expected to fall more than 10% year over year to $13.8 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, and earnings per share are projected to drop 77% to $0.12. The company named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs, with Holthaus heading the newly formed Intel Products division. Two former high-level executives critiqued the move, with one saying Holthaus has "no technical skill." " To put these co-CEOs in shows you they had no succession plan," Rasgon told Yahoo Finance. He said the CEO " everybody wants" to see is Lip-Bu Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, who is reportedly a candidate. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization. Zinsner and Holthaus did not respond to Yahoo Finance's requests for comment. During UBS's Technology and AI Conference in Arizona on Dec. 4, Zinsner said Intel remains committed to its foundry business. " [We] still want to be a world-class foundry, want to be the western provider of leading-edge silicon to customers," he said. One former executive said the best pick for Intel's permanent CEO should be a " hardcore" chips expert who understands the technology. Another agreed — but indicated the person needs to be an outsider. "Nobody in the Intel Technology Development Group, who's either at the top level or one level down, would even have a seat at the table anywhere in the first three levels of management at TSMC," said the former executive who worked in Intel's foundry. While the government is funding the expansion of TSMC’s and Samsung’s foundries in the US, the vast majority of those companies’ manufacturing capacity is in their home countries of Taiwan and South Korea, per Miller. That's seen by some as a national security risk in case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. But "that doesn't automatically make Intel the solution," Rasgon said. " We can throw all the money we want at Intel, it doesn't necessarily fix the problem," he added. Nearly 80% of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance, including Rasgon, have a Hold rating on the stock, with an average price target of $24 over the next 12 months. "I don't envy the new CEO," one former executive said. "How many leading-edge silicon providers can the world afford? Is it two or is it three? If it's three, then you'd say, 'OK, as long as they get their manufacturing technology up, it'll be OK.' If it's two, then ... who's going to die as a foundry, Intel or Samsung?"

Title: How innovation died at Intel: America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer faces an uncertain future and lawsuits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel's (INTC) fall from grace seemed to happen all at once. Shares of the once iconic chipmaker plummeted 60% in 2024. The company posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report. Its market cap has dropped 80% since 2000 — when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world. In November, an ascendant Nvidia (NVDA) replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A month later, CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned after taking the helm in February 2021. And on Wednesday the company was hit with yet another lawsuit filed by shareholders — this time seeking damages related to substantial losses from its struggling foundry division. But company insiders and industry analysts tell Yahoo Finance that Intel's dramatic crash is the result of a slow deterioration spanning more than two decades. “They had a God complex; they were super arrogant,” a former high-level executive who worked at Intel for more than 20 years told Yahoo Finance. “They felt like they had such a large competitive advantage that they could never do anything wrong.” The cause of Intel’s decay? A culture of complacency, short-term thinking, and lack of execution, all while its rivals got better. Today, Intel is hemorrhaging share in the very market it created, losing customers to AMD (AMD), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance. The x86 architecture underpinning Intel and AMD's products is, in turn, losing share to British chip designer Arm (ARM), according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Those chips altogether — CPUs, or central processing units — are existentially threatened by the rise of AI-focused GPUs, or graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia. And its fledgling foundry business is bleeding cash while competitors snatch fat contracts leveraging machine technology that Intel once funded. In 2024, Nvidia's stock is up 173%, while Arm, Broadcom (AVGO), and TSMC (TSM) clocked 93%, 101%, and 92% gains, respectively. Yahoo Finance spoke with half a dozen Wall Street analysts and experts and more than a dozen current and former employees (including high-level executives who were at the company for over a decade) for an inside look at Intel's failures and its future as America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. The employees were granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Intel spokesperson said, "We are executing with rigor on our plan to rebuild product and process leadership and improve our profitability. The work we are doing to strengthen our product portfolio, combined with our disciplined focus on driving returns on our foundry investments, supports our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable financial performance and unlock shareholder value.” As the rise of Arm-based chips and AI GPUs eroded Intel's standing, Pat Gelsinger promised to turn things around by launching a foundry business — leveraging Intel's manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers. The move was intended to bring back bold, innovative thinking — a "Grovian" mindset, referring to its famed former CEO Andy Grove. Some say it was Gelsinger’s best bet. “I think it's the right move because without looking outside the company and pursuing external customers, it's a shrinking company,” Hari said. Others were skeptical of the approach. Multiple analysts and insiders said the decline of Intel’s product business handcuffed its ability to fund Gelsinger’s aggressive capital spending and hiring sprees — which gave way to layoffs that depressed morale. Several employees commended what they described as Gelsinger’s brilliance and good character: One posted on LinkedIn about Gelsinger helping his grandson access medications to treat a fatal genetic disease. Others contended that Gelsinger set expectations too high, then acted more as a cheerleader than executor and refused to listen to input that didn’t align with his vision. Gelsinger’s stated target when he became CEO was to have Intel’s foundry generating $15 billion in revenue by 2030 — roughly double the $8.5 billion Samsung generated last year after nearly two decades of operation, according to Gartner data cited by Rasgon. In its most recent quarter, Intel’s net loss totaled $16.6 billion due to substantial losses in its chip manufacturing division. “Intel has not demonstrated that they can execute on foundry … because they don't have a track record and the track record that you've seen from their internal execution has been so flawed,” KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. “It's hard for anyone to commit any major mission-critical applications for them. And as a result of that, Intel is not going to pick up any sort of meaningful business.” Its last hope to right a sinking ship has been called into question. Under Gelsinger, Intel staked its fate on a new advanced manufacturing process called 18A — which the company’s corporate vice president Bruce Andrews told the Financial Times in November would “bring [the company] back to technological leadership.” The process would allow Intel to manufacture the most advanced AI chips with tiny components tens of thousands of times smaller than the size of a human body cell. Intel initially said it would begin high-volume production with its 18A process in the first half of 2025, then moved that target to the second half of next year, according to its third quarter earnings call. Internal testing of 18A earlier this year reportedly showed it wasn’t ready for high-volume production. A current employee at one of Intel’s fabs told Yahoo Finance there are “a lot of issues” making chips with the 18A process. They said that Intel is not ready to take on external customers and that communications between teams that should take days often take weeks as employees avoid responsibility for mishaps. Intel declined a request to comment on 18A, but pointed to recent commentary from its temporary co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus stating that 18A is on track to roll out by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, Intel has already purchased at least $760 million worth of machinery for its successor manufacturing process to 18A, called 14A. Gelsinger was ousted on Dec. 1 by Intel’s board, which has been criticized as “extremely weak” and lacking “hardened semiconductor people” by sources Yahoo Finance spoke to.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Tiger Global's 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other stock picks. Even as the venture capital efforts of Tiger Global Management come under increased scrutiny on the back of reportedly disappointing post-pandemic performance, the 13F portfolio of the fund seems to be performing exceedingly well to taper over these concerns. From the beginning of 2023 through to the end of the first quarter of 2024, the public long positions of the fund returned more than 80% to investors. These were dominated by prominent stakes in hyperscalers riding the AI boom. The rate of return posted by the fund was more than double the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 over the period. In contrast, a recent report by news publication Bloomberg reveals that the sixteenth private markets fund of Tiger Global, which set out with a target to raise more than $6 billion in funding back in 2022, closed with $2.2 billion in funding earlier this year. Tech news platform TechCrunch reports that the VC efforts of Tiger Global are suffering from a reputation of making bad bets during the pandemic. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Even though perfectly-timed bets on tech stocks are the claim to fame for Tiger Global in the past few years, a team from the fund recently noted in an investor letter that 30% of its exposure sits in businesses other than the AI-driven tech sector. Per the fund, these positions have roughly doubled over the last fifteen months with an 80% hit rate. Compared to these astute bets, the venture capital efforts of the company paint a grimmer picture. For example, a recent report by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System reveals that the paper losses on the fifteen private markets fund stood at more than 15% at the end of June 2024. This fund had raised more than $12.7 billion back in 2021 to invest in high growth areas. Data from PitchBook Benchmarks shows that the steep losses of this fund place it in the bottom 10% of all venture funds raised in 2021. However, there is still time for some of these investments to bear fruit in the long term. The investment team at Tiger Global is certainly losing no sleep over these numbers. In a letter to investors, the fund has noted that the private holdings of the fund generated positive returns in the first quarter of 2024. This year, the VC arm of Tiger Global has invested in many prominent startups, including Waymo, OpenAI, Scale AI and Wiz. The Tiger Global team stressed in the letter that a meaningful portion of the private exposure of the public fund is concentrated in global market leaders who are performing well and awaiting attractive opportunities to go public. The team further added that it was also encouraged by the signs of life in the IPO market following relative dormancy over the last two years. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Tiger Global Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) develops and operates proprietary technology applications worldwide. Even though the fund trimmed its stake in the company by 14% in the past few months, the firm is still one of the top long term stock picks of Tiger Global. It has featured in the 13F portfolio of the fund constantly since the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, Tiger Global owned close to 2.6 million shares in the ride hailing firm worth close to $200 million, representing 0.83% of the portfolio. Just like Tiger Global, Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc.(NYSE:UBER). Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently termed the firm as one of its top stock picks for 2025. In an investor note, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan said Uber's risk-to-reward balance was among the most attractive heading into 2025. Sheridan highlighted that Uber was mired in a series of short-term debates, including discussion on pricing inflation and competition impact on mobility growth, as well as medium/long-term industry concerns over the impact of autonomous vehicles on supply/demand if not outright disintermediation. Against that backdrop, we see a company that can continue to deliver on its February 2024 Investor Day commitments despite the rise of autonomous vehicles, countered Sheridan. Overall UBER ranks 9th on our list of Tiger Global Management's long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) a Cheap NYSE Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NYSE Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) stands against other cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now. The stock market appears poised for another year of impressive returns, likely extending into 2025. However, concerns about high valuations persist. To gain insight into this, Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business, recently joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on December 14. Damodaran recognized that it’s tough to keep up after two years of returns over 25%. He mentioned that if the market stays stable until the end of the year, it would be similar to the high points seen in the 1950s and mid-1970s. However, he was doubtful about being able to keep this strong performance going, as it’s challenging to continue rising after such big gains. When asked if the market is overvalued, Damodaran said that while prices are high, they haven’t reached the level of a bubble yet. He compared the current situation to the late 1990s but clarified that he doesn’t plan to sell all his investments. Instead, he is hesitant to invest cash right away because staying in cash might mean losing out on potential gains. He also mentioned that while there may be limited growth in price-to-earnings ratios in 2025, there could still be good returns due to better-than-expected earnings growth from new government policies. Damodaran believes that a return of 8% to 10% would be satisfactory for him, as he prioritizes preserving wealth over aiming for very high returns. The US stock market currently presents a mixed valuation picture. According to Morningstar, Large growth stocks have experienced significant price appreciation. However, their current valuations may not fully reflect the inherent risks associated with high growth expectations and potential competition. Consumer defensive stocks tend to be less volatile during economic downturns, but the current valuations may be inflated due to a perceived safe-haven status. Utilities may be currently overvalued relative to their historical performance and future earnings potential as interest rates rise. The industrial sector may be overvalued due to concerns about potential economic slowdowns and rising input costs, although some sub-sectors may offer value. Conversely, the communication services sector may present attractive opportunities for investors. While facing challenges such as increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, certain companies within this sector may be undervalued relative to their long-term growth prospects. The energy sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years. However, with increasing global energy demand and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, certain segments of the energy sector may be undervalued at current prices. Markets are constantly evolving, influenced by various factors such as economic growth, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Damodaran’s insights reflect a cautious view of market prospects heading into 2025, emphasizing careful investment strategies amid high valuations. We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top NYSE-listed stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15 that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. Current Forward P/E as of December 16: 12.5 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in the oil and gas industry. It focuses on upstream operations, which encompass the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. It is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. Its third-quarter 2024 earnings of $8.6 billion were driven in part by the successful integration of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company in the US which is primarily focused on the Permian Basin in Texas. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (NYSE:XOM) Upstream segment’s year-to-date 2024 earnings doubled compared to 2019 to reach $10.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. This is attributed to the acquisition of Pioneer, which added 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-quality production to the company’s portfolio. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) leverages its technology and Pioneer’s Permian Basin acreage for efficiency gains. Industry-leading laterals (including a recent 18,250-foot well and planned 20,000-foot well) reduce well counts, minimize surface impact, and improve capital efficiency. This drives Upstream success and strong shareholder returns. Overall, XOM ranks 6th on our list of cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of XOM, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Time Published: 2024-12-20T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: C21’s most read stories of 2024

As we bring down the curtain on 2024 with our final newsfeed of the year, this countdown of our 40 most-read news stories highlights an industry hyper-focused on threats, opportunities and money. Amazon Prime’s The Rings of Power failed to halt job losses at the streamer I’ll be honest, dear reader, sometimes you guys break my heart. That exclusive we spent weeks on, that story we fought with the lawyers over, that line we spent months double sourcing, that saucy bit of industry gossip we worked so hard to stand up… then I pull up our most read stories at the end of the year and proudly top of the pile is a news brief about a Turkish drama being renewed for a sixth season. That is, thankfully, not the case for 2024. In fact, this year’s top 40 countdown of our most read news stories re-affirms our editorial priorities when we sit down every morning at 06.30 (slightly later if QPR have won the night before) and start putting together our daily newsfeed. Those priorities, other than ‘have we got this exclusively?’, can most simply be categorised into one of three piles: Is this a threat? Is this an opportunity? Is this about money? Just about every one of the stories on our top 40 countdown this year fits one of those categories. The most clear and obvious threat, all year, was job losses. We started the year in New Orleans listening to factual producers talking “Survive to 25” and, sure enough, it’s been a bloodbath out there. “Amazon axing ‘several hundred’ jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios” at number one, “500 more jobs to go at BBC as BBCS sales suffer in a ‘challenging’ market” at number 10, Paramount’s ongoing cuts and merger chat at 12, and 19, myriad crises in Canada (30), and New Zealand (40). There were late year entries for the looming spectre of AI, most notably OpenAI’s Sora launch at Content London and the subsequent fall out which saw Simon Mirren label the tech “the greatest IP theft in history” (7) and the outright panic among natural history filmmakers in particular at WildScreen the month before (6). AI continued to make the headlines in 2024 AI could of course be an opportunity as well. Embattled, skint production companies able to save huge amounts of time, resource and money on the wage bill by having the tech do the dog work. Minority voices may also be more empowered to tell their stories with the boundaries of money and commissioners stripped away. Still though, individual execs moving around feature heavily in our countdown as always. Has my favourite commissioner just lost her job, and what does that mean for my prospects at that network? Are they moving to a bigger, better network that I haven’t worked with before and now have an ‘in’ at? Or, perhaps you lot are just nosey, gossipy sorts. Either way André Renaud heading to Warner Bros from BBC Studios (2), Charlie Irwin stepping up as Jonno Richards leaves the forever merging/separating Fremantle labels Talkback and Thames (11), Elizabeth Randell at BBC Studios Kids & Family (14), Alexandra Finlay’s departure at A+E Networks (16), Rola Bauer’s latest movements (21), and new gigs for Channel 4 alums Carline Horlick (29) and Phil Harris (32) show this is still a people business – the machines haven’t taken over just yet. Money looms large over this list. More so than the content, which is really only represented by a handful of stories mostly about Netflix (4th, 22nd, 31st, 34th). Who’s got it, who don’t got it, and how can I get some? Problems facing studios space in the UK (5), companies like Anton/Blackrock splashing cash (24), financials at Channel 4 and Netflix (26 and 27) and the latest state of British exports and copro market (36) all rated highly. It’s the economy, stupid. Threat, opportunity, money. Your success or otherwise in 2025 will likely depend which of those three piles we find ourselves placing the majority of stories about your company… The top 40…

Title: Greystar buys Dublin student housing scheme for around €150m

A US-headquartered property investor has acquired the largest purpose-built student accommodation development in the Republic for around €150 million, marking the biggest residential property deal of the year. Greystar, the South Carolina-anchored property investment company, has agreed to buy the Michael O’Flynn-developed Point Campus scheme in Dublin’s docklands from German asset manager DWS. The deal marks Greystar’s first foray into the student housing market in the Republic and the €150 million price tag makes it the largest single residential property deal in the Republic in 2024. The second biggest was DWS’s €97.5 million deal for the 207-unit Hayfield apartment project in Killiney. In a statement on Friday, Greystar said the fully occupied 966-bed Point Campus development will be operated by its student housing platform Canvas, which currently operates beds in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain. Claire Solon, managing director of Greystar Ireland, said the group is “excited to enter the student accommodation market” in the Republic. “We believe the business is well positioned to benefit from strong ongoing demand from Irish and international students, given the undersupply of high quality and professionally-managed accommodation.” Originally developed by Mr O’Flynn and global fund giant BlackRock in 2016, Point Campus was acquired by Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS in 2020, reportedly for some €172 million. In addition to the bed spaces, the building includes a cinema, a gym, a common room and a roof terrace and is adjacent to the Point Square shopping centre and the 3Arena in the north docklands. Greystar has been involved in several high-profile property deals, including its 2022 acquisition of Dalguise House in Monkstown, South Dublin for around €30 million. The firm subsequently applied for permission to build 488 apartments on the site. An Bord Pleanála approved a scaled-down scheme in February, ordering the removal of 101 units from the plan. Market dynamics in the Republic remain extremely favourable for purpose-built student accommodation investors, with Dublin alone experiencing an acute shortfall of between 25,000 and 65,000-bed spaces relative to demand, according to estimates. However, the industry voiced its concern earlier this year after the Government legislated over the summer to effectively ban the practice of large-scale student landlords offering 51-week-only leases at their properties. The new law, which means student housing operators must also offer standard 41-week leases to students, more in line with the typical academic year, followed a decision by some large-scale operators to switch to a 51-week-only lease model. The change by operators was criticised by the then-minister for higher education Simon Harris and Sinn Féin’s higher education spokeswoman Mairéad Farrell as well as student unions and the representative body for Ireland’s university sector. An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act, effectively banning companies from offering only lengthier leases, was passed by the Dáil in July, prompting threats of legal action from some companies.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: CagriSema demonstrates superior weight loss in adults with obesity or overweight in the REDEFINE 1 trial

December 20, 2024 05:41 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from REDEFINE 1, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 1 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to the individual components cagrilintide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once-weekly. The trial included 3,417 randomised people with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and a mean baseline body weight of 106.9 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks compared to a reduction of 11.8% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.1% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.3% with placebo alone. In addition, 40.4% of patients who received CagriSema reached a weight loss of 25% or more after 68 weeks, compared to 6.0% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 0.9% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 20.4% compared to a reduction of 11.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 14.9% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.0% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.” The results from the second pivotal phase 3 trial, REDEFINE 2, in adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight are expected during the first half of 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby help people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. Additional phase 3 trials are ongoing. REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,400 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – a 72-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

Title: How Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lost its glow amid layoffs and pivots
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-layoffs-restructuring-pivots-struggling-celebrity-brand-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Gwyneth Paltrow took a measured tone earlier this year when she discussed Goop, her newsletter turned e-commerce company, onstage at a Forbes event. She didn't brag about the nine figures the brand had raised or its latest product release. Instead, she said she was proud Goop was still in business. "Some years we're down, then we're back up," she said. "I'm proud that we're still alive and kicking." That might seem surprising for a company that was valued at $433 million in 2020 and was a trailblazer for what a celebrity brand could be. But it's reflective of a company that — despite its name recognition and pop-culture footprint — has undergone several painful pivots in recent years. In September, Goop laid off nearly 20% of its staff, including its chief technology officer and its vice president of content. A few weeks later, it laid off about 6% of the remaining employees. Goop's recent cuts come as the company shifts focus to its beauty, fashion, and food businesses. It's the latest in a series of strategy changes over the past several years. Changes in focus are normal for a startup. Still, after 16 years of existence, the company isn't profitable and continues to struggle to build a firm foundation apart from Paltrow. The company's once buzzy supplement regimens generated $100,000 in sales on the day they launched in 2017. Now, only one of the four initial regimens is still offered online, and for a discount. A Goop spokesperson told Business Insider that any new supplements it launched would be part of its beauty business. Julia Hunter, a Goop board member and the former CEO of Jenni Kayne, addressed some of the company's struggles in an interview with Puck, published after BI sent Goop a series of questions for this story. "The company is doing very well from a revenue perspective, butoperating expenses have continued to grow," Hunter said. "I know that it's unpopular to let people go, but they hired a lot of people that they probably shouldn't have." On the content side, Goop has recently cut many editorial positions, including the vice president of content, the head beauty editor, and several other editors. A review of Goop's website shows few new articles, and its book imprint hasn't published a new release in over a year. The magazine ran two issues before folding, and while there were reports that Goop's Netflix series, "The Goop Lab," was renewed, it hasn't materialized. Paltrow's importance to the brand is evident in product launches, two former Goop employees told BI. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation; their identities are known to BI. When she's part of a launch campaign, Goop calls it an "A launch," and the performance of the advertising on social media "quadruples," one of the former employees said. Performance often drops off once she's no longer involved, this person added. Last month, a video featuring Paltrow that promoted Goop's newest release, a retinol serum, drew 1,100 likes on Instagram. The next day, a second post about the serum — which didn't include Paltrow — got fewer than 275 likes. "Brands need to find viable business models, rather than simply a celebrity face," Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital, said of A-list entrepreneurs. The celebrity brands that have grown to be the largest — like Kim Kardashian's Skims, Rihanna's Fenty, and Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty — have moved beyond their founder's image. Skims, which is valued at $4 billion, has made using models from popular culture a core part of its marketing strategy, for instance. Goop's founding story has become lore to a certain type of aspirant. In 2008, Paltrow was sitting in the kitchen of the London house she shared with her then-husband, Chris Martin, when she decided to write a newsletter for "family, friends, and friends of friends." The issue featured a recipe for banana muffins and photos shot on Paltrow's BlackBerry. "It was one of the first of its kind to leverage a curated lifestyle of a celebrity," Stacy Jones, the CEO of the branding agency Hollywood Branded, told BI. "It is aligned to her own personal brand in a very unique way that hadn't been done to that extent before." Before long, Paltrow was earning small checks from advertisers and began dreaming of a media empire. Paltrow hired media veterans from Meredith and Condé Nast to run the publication. There was a lifestyle website with travel guides and interviews on alternative medicine. Paltrow launched a publishing imprint, Goop Press, in 2015 and a magazine in partnership with Condé Nast in 2017. Conferences promised to be the next big thing for the brand when the In Goop Health Summit series kicked off in 2017, offering (mainly) women the promise of looking and feeling like Paltrow for the four-figure ticket price. In 2020, as streaming entered its golden age, she scored a deal with Netflix. But Goop suffered in recent years amid a broader digital media downturn. "Advertising business as a big part of revenue started to decline, and that was probably the biggest shift to revenue of the last several years," Hunter told Puck, adding that going forward, editorial would be "integrated with social media." Paltrow still posts regular episodes of the Goop podcast, and after a few years off because of the pandemic, the In Goop Health Summit returned last year. That said, Goop's media projects appear to have been largely shut down, as many of the staffers behind them were affected by the recent cuts. As Goop's media initiatives fell short, its e-commerce ambitions — or what the company dubbed "contextual commerce" — took center stage. The core of its e-commerce business has ebbed and flowed over the years. First, it pushed skincare, then fashion, then wellness. Now, it's back to beauty and fashion. "It's a lot of testing" of different verticals, the second former employee said. In May, Goop brought in outside consultants, led by Hunter, to help streamline the organization and reduce payroll. Then, in September, Goop announced its latest pivot, saying it would double down on fashion, beauty, and food. These aren't new initiatives for Goop, but the company has touted their recent growth. G. Label, the company's in-house clothing line, launched in 2016. The company told BI that the brand's sales were up 45% this year compared with the same period last year, but it declined to share the revenue numbers. The two former employees said they felt G. Label had historically underperformed partly because it was initially designed to fit Paltrow, who, at a slender 5-foot-9, has a much different figure from that of the average American woman. "We were just putting together whatever Gwyneth felt like wearing," the first former employee said. They added that the company revised the line in the past year using a new, standard-fit model, which they said had helped its sales. The Goop spokesperson said a new designer had been hired for G. Label in the past year and revamped the line. Goop's first foray into beauty was also in 2016. A few of the products have repeat customers — the neck peptide serum is a top seller — but there isn't a breakthrough hero product. Some recent efforts to expand the beauty offerings haven't taken off. Last year, the company launched Good Clean Goop, a moderately priced line, in Target and Amazon. Since then, the company has discounted a number of the brand's products, including the Daily Juice Cleanser and the Healthy Aging Serum. Puck reported in June that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target. The brand has not posted on social media in more than a month. The two former employees said Goop's contract with Target would end at the beginning of next year. Then there's Goop Kitchen, the "food" piece, which is not part of the core company. The Goop spokesperson said Goop Kitchen was set up as a joint venture and called it a "separate commercial entity." They declined to share what ownership stake Goop has, if any. Goop has publicly touted growth statistics — like a 25% sales increase for Goop Beauty and a 45% increase for G. Label. The former employees said these figures were driven in part by an influx of paid ad spend. The Goop spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is profitable. Hunter told Puck it wasn't. Whether Goop's latest efforts to boost revenue and cut back on staff are enough to turn the company around remains to be seen. Paltrow, for her part, has hinted that she wants Goop to thrive without her. "I don't think I can have this job forever," she told The New York Times last year. "I think it would be nice to return my investors' money, and I really want to do that. That's important to me." Jump to

Title: PitchBook: Enterprise tech momentum in 2025 will be fueled by AI growth and crypto revival

UPDATED 00:01 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 by Duncan Riley The enterprise technology market is set to undergo transformative changes in 2025, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, crypto and vertical integration, according to the annual 2025 Enterprise Technology Outlook report from PitchBook Data Inc. To no one’s surprise, given the massive growth in the sector through 2024, the report leads with AI and machine learning. OpenAI set a high-water benchmark for AI startups, reaching a $157 billion valuation. 2024 also saw private companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and SpaceX, hit or surpass $100 billion valuations. PitchBook used the term “centicorn” to describe them. The report predicts that 2025 will see the rise of more “centicorns” in the AI sector, with private companies such as Anthropic PBC, CoreWeave Inc. and Databricks Inc. set to follow OpenAI’s trajectory. Anthropic, backed by Amazon Web Services Inc. and others, is on track to exceed $1 billion in revenue by leveraging its privacy-focused models to capture a significant share of the generative AI market. Likewise, CoreWeave’s hardware-centric business model is forecast to achieve a 230% revenue increase in 2025, driven by demand for inference computing. Another contender for centicorn status, Databricks, recently raised $10 billion on a $62 billion valuation and is predicted by PitchBook to be a strong candidate for a $100 billion valuation in 2025. The developments highlight the expanding market opportunities and investor confidence in AI as a key driver in enterprise innovation. On the cryptocurrency front, PitchBook forecasts a resurgence in venture capital funding, with annual investments projected to exceed $18 billion in 2025. The forecast marks a significant recovery from the more subdued levels over the last two years, when funding hovered at about $9.9 billion annually. The report attributes the revival in the cryptocurrency sector to growing institutional involvement from major players such as BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose regulatory credibility and established networks are driving broader market confidence. The report also notes a shift in investment priorities within the crypto ecosystem. PitchBook believes that generalist VCs will reenter the market in 2025 with a focus on startups with clear use cases in decentralized finance, Web3 infrastructure and consumer-facing applications. The renewed interest is anticipated to result in larger funding rounds and higher valuations, especially for late-stage investments. For the enterprise software-as-a-service market in 2025, the report comes back to AI, specifically the rise of autonomous AI agents in reshaping operations and customer engagement. AI agents, autonomous systems powered by AI designed to perform specific tasks or make decisions with minimal human intervention, are expected to streamline workflows and automate complex tasks across sectors such as human resources, analytics and customer relationship management. Integrating into existing SaaS ecosystems, agents are expected to allow businesses to drive efficiency while enhancing the quality of customer interactions. PitchBook believes that AI agents will particularly disrupt customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning platforms, where AI agents are already delivering real-time, personalized support and decision-making capabilities. SaaS vendors are increasingly adopting AI agents to create tailored, industry-specific solutions that boost customer loyalty and reduce operational costs. Other trends forecast for 2025 in the report include a growing role for regulatory technology in enterprise fintech mergers and acquisitions, driven by its niche specializations despite underfunding in the sector. Consolidation in DevOps is also anticipated next year as major SaaS providers acquire startups to streamline fragmented markets and enhance competitive offerings. Additionally, insurance technology is noted as seeing increased vertical integration, with companies adopting seamless models that combine products, insurance and services to improve customer experiences and operational efficiency.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

December 19, 2024 19:35 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI) publicly traded securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until February 17, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. Captioned Krivenok v. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz, No. 24-cv-10926 (C.D. Cal.), the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit charges Kaspi.kz and certain of Kaspi.kz’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-joint-stock-company-kaspi-kz-class-action-lawsuit-kspi.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Kaspi.kz provides payments, marketplace, and fintech solutions for consumers and merchants in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing Kaspi.kz to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (ii) Kaspi.kz engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; and (iii) certain of Kaspi.kz’s executives have links to reputed criminals. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit further alleges that on September 19, 2024, Culper Research issued a report entitled “Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money for Criminals and Kleptocrats.” On this news, the price of Kaspi.kz American depositary shares fell nearly 19% over two trading sessions, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Kaspi.kz publicly traded securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit.

The video, which is housed on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF page on BlackRock’s website, spends three minutes walking viewers through the evolution of money and key fundamentals of Bitcoin. One of those fundamentals is Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed token supply. While the video explains the pros of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, a caption simultaneously cautions viewers with a disclaimer: “There is no guarantee Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” That’s a sore spot for Bitcoin maximalists, who hold Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a nearly sacred tenet that ensures the cryptocurrency’s status as “hard money.” The caption remains for approximately five seconds, eventually fading away as the narrator elaborates on the benefits of a fixed supply, never addressing the potential change. Most crypto observers might have missed it if not for MicroStrategy founder and massive Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor sharing the video on his X account on Tuesday. BlackRock explains #Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/X2fPl8tL2s — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 17, 2024 And despite being just a footnote in the video, crypto observers have now latched onto the disclaimer and raised alarms. “This is the problem with tradfi,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko commented on X, referring to traditional finance and Wall Street. “They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them,” he posted. He then challenged both BlackRock and Saylor to commit to running their own full nodes—that is, the software that operates the Bitcoin network—and guarantee they would only ever support the fork that maintains a fixed 21 million supply. “They need to become the decentralized network, not be investors of it,” Yakovenko said. This is the problem with tradfi. They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them. What blackrock and saylor needs to commit to is that their own full nodes will always guarantees 21m supply and they will only call the fork that their full nodes follow Bitcoin.… https://t.co/h4oHMQyse7 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) December 19, 2024 Part of the reason this has got Bitcoiners and other crypto users so worked up is because it isn’t the first time BlackRock has made such a disclaimer. The company included a note in its June 2023 ETF filing which indicated that “a hard fork could change the source code to the Bitcoin network, including the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap.” Some of the more paranoid in crypto began speculating immediately that BlackRock might use its newfound power as one of the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world to influence changes to the network, including the BTC supply. Commenting yesterday on the new ad, author and philosopher Steve Patterson said on X: “You really think your little fucking node running on a Raspberry Pi is going to prevent Blackrock from uncapping the supply of Bitcoin?” Are these concerns unfounded? Probably, but it’s got the Bitcoin community talking, including Blockstream founder Adam Back and early dev Peter Todd (who HBO recently suggested could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself). A hard fork would require a majority of the Bitcoin miners, or those producing blocks and verifying transactions, to agree on new supply mechanics—something most in crypto suspect will never happen. Still, Todd today reminded the community that it is technically possible. “Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can,” he posted on X. I wrote an entire article on tail emission: https://t.co/ChNUpifYUo Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can. — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) December 19, 2024 Nevertheless, Bitcoin stakeholders agreeing to change something as fundamental to Bitcoin’s core as its fixed supply would appear to run counter to the financial incentive that exists to maintain the status quo. So why would BlackRock continue to make it an issue? Responding to criticism regarding the “silence” from Bitcoin OGs on BlackRock’s perceived misstep, Back said: “Obviously their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and they don’t have control.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Time Published: 2024-12-19T22:36:59Z

Mo Shaikh, co-founder and outgoing CEO of Aptos Labs, has announced his decision to step down, marking a new chapter for the blockchain company. Shaikh, who has been deeply involved in the blockchain space since 2016, co-founded Aptos Labs three years ago with Avery Ching. Together, they aimed to create a scalable, resilient blockchain foundation to support fair and efficient products for the future. In a heartfelt post on X, Shaikh expressed his pride in what the company has achieved. Aptos has grown to become one of the most robust ecosystems in the blockchain space, trusted by over a thousand builders and innovators around the globe. The platform, which leverages the Move programming language originally developed for Facebook’s Diem project, has successfully raised $400 million in venture capital funding from top-tier investors like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Mastercard, Google, and PayPal. Shaikh acknowledged the contributions of early builders and partners who have helped shape the ecosystem, including Merkle Trade, Thala Labs, Kyd Labs, Econia, MyCo, and Aave, among others. He emphasized the importance of the collaboration between Web3 and Web2, which Aptos is at the forefront of driving. Reflecting on his departure, Shaikh noted his true passion for building companies from the ground up and the pride he feels in Aptos Labs’ world-class team. While stepping back from the daily operations, he will remain a strategic advisor to the company and continue to support its mission as Aptos’ most established layer-1 blockchain. Over the coming months, Shaikh plans to take time to reflect on the future of blockchain technology and explore ways to evolve financial systems to maintain Aptos’ leading role in the space. As Aptos enters its next phase of growth, Ching will take over as the CEO, a decision Shaikh says he is confident will drive the company towards even greater success. In his own post, Ching expressed excitement and determination to lead Aptos Labs into its next phase of growth. “Supporting and growing the ambitious Aptos builders and community, pushing the boundaries of innovation in Web3 technology, and high-velocity pioneering products are my immediate priorities,” Ching wrote. The start of Ching’s leadership marks a new era for Aptos, as the company aims to continue driving innovation and scaling possibilities across the ecosystem. Notably, Shaikh’s departure and Ching’s appointment come at a pivotal time for Aptos, as it remains at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, poised to shape the future of decentralized finance.

getty If increasing net worth is on your list of 2025 resolutions, re-evaluating your growth stock portfolio may be the first action item. You can fill the gaps with companies that have proven growth track records and strong outlooks. Seven promising stocks to consider are introduced below. Growth stocks are equity shares likely to outperform their peers and the broader market. Outperformance can happen when a company successfully delivers an innovative solution to a sizable audience. Companies that unlock this growth puzzle tend to keep doing it. To be clear, past growth performance does not guarantee future success. But it does show a leadership team's ability to see big opportunities, implement solutions and create value. For that reason, my screening criteria for growth stocks includes historic growth metrics and future performance expectations: Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and get unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. The table below shows seven top growth stocks that meet the above parameters. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Let's take a closer look at each of these fast-growing companies. Data comes from company reports and Stockanalysis.com. Eli Lilly is a drugmaker offering treatments for diabetes, weight loss, plaque psoriasis, anxiety, fibromyalgia and other conditions. Eli Lilly has business momentum, thanks to Mounjaro and Zepbound, two formulations that treat diabetes and obesity, respectively. Both drugs are versions of the compound tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 drugs have been popular since competing product Ozempic became the weight-loss answer for Hollywood A-listers. Ozempic is technically a diabetes medication, but its maker Novo Nordisk markets a related product called Wegovy for weight loss. Demand for Ozempic, Wegovy and the Eli Lilly treatments have outpaced supply, causing shortages in the U.S. Lilly is addressing the shortage by investing billions in production capacity. The company has also completed clinical trials showing its Zepbound treatment is more effective for weight loss than Wegovy. Since 2020, LLY's EPS has varied from $5.80 to $6.90. Analysts expect 2024 and 2025 EPS of $13.32 and $22.24, respectively. ServiceNow offers a workflow automation platform for enterprise technology management. The platform is sold on a subscription basis to Fortune 500 companies and others. In the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow had subscription growth of 22.5%—beating the high end of the company's guidance. Customers are responding well to ServiceNow's AI-focused messaging. The company is positioning its Now platform as an essential AI-powered resource for digital transformation. The company's investments in efficiency-enhancing generative AI features are also paying off. Examples include industry-targeted AI solutions for financial services, telecommunications and more. ServiceNow is also incorporating agenic AI into its platform. Agenic AI is an emerging AI innovation that can complete complex tasks, learn and make decisions without human intervention. Analysts expect NOW to produce 2024 and 2025 EPS of $14.06 and $16.87, respectively. The company delivered $8.42 in EPS in 2023 and $1.60 in 2022. Shopify manages and sells a commerce platform that customers use to manage inventory and sell products online and offline. Shopify generates about $8 billion in annual revenue with a leading 28% market share in the e-commerce platform segment. Like ServiceNow, Shopify invests continually in platform features to enhance efficiency and productivity for customers. In Shopify's case, the customers range from solo entrepreneurs to big brands. Recent enhancements include the launch of generative AI to respond to customer queries and the expansion of sales tax management to the entire EU. The company has a great growth track record, expanding sales from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $7 billion last year. Analysts expect EPS of $1.29 in 2024 and $1.54 in 2025, both sizable upticks from the $0.10 earned in 2023.

MercadoLibre manages the top e-commerce marketplace and one of the largest online payment platforms in Latin America. MELI is often called the "Amazon of South America." Both companies operate dominant e-commerce marketplaces in their regions and have delivered strong returns to shareholders for a decade. MercadoLibre does not have a cloud computing business like Amazon, but it does have a popular digital payment solution, Mercado Pago. Between 2019 and 2023, MercadoLibre grew annual revenues from $2.2 billion to more than $14.4 billion. The bottom line increased from a $3.71 loss per share to earnings of $19.47 per share, with steady operating margin growth along the way. Analysts expect the growth pattern to continue. Strengthening economic conditions in Argentina is one reason for optimism. MercadoLibre has a strong position there in e-commerce and payments, with no formidable competitors. The 2024 and 2025 EPS predictions for MELI are $36.10 and $47.92, respectively. Monolithic Power Systems designs and sells power circuits that control voltage to servers, AI and storage applications, vehicle components, home appliances, communications infrastructure and more. Monolithic has revenue exposure to three transforming industries: automotive, AI and 5G. This positioning helped the company raise its stock price from about $384 in 2021 to a high of $940 last October. However, the MPWR stock price has since dipped to the $590s. The prompt was a report speculating that Nvidia canceled its backlogged orders of a Monolithic product due to performance issues. Monolithic denied the speculations, but investors have not been convinced. The pullback may create an opportunity to buy this growing company. A Citi analyst thinks so. Analyst Kelsey Chia initiated coverage on MPWR with a buy rating and a price target of $700. Chia cited strength in AI and automotive, arguing that the opportunity available will outweigh any market share loss for Monolithic with Nvidia. Analysts expect MPWR to produce 2024 EPS of $14.35, up from $8.76 in the prior year. The 2025 EPS outlook is $16.89. Shift4 Payments provides integrated payment processing solutions to merchants in the U.S. and internationally. Shift4 Payments has steadily grown sales from $731 million in 2019 to more than $3 billion in the 12 months before September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company produced record cash flow, signed new hospitality and gaming customers, expanded geographically and raised its full-year sales and Ebitda outlooks. With strong sales, a $33 billion backlog and three acquisitions to integrate, Shift4 Payments has momentum. Acquisitions of POS companies Revel and Vectron expand the company's network of merchant customers, driving revenue and creating cross-sell opportunities. Those are a few reasons why analysts believe FOUR will produce EPS of $3.75 in 2024 and $4.71 in 2025—marking significant earnings improvement from $1.42 in 2023. Corcept Therapeutics develops treatments for metabolic, psychiatric and oncologic disorders. The company has one marketed product, a cortisol receptor blocker called Korlym. Corcept's pipeline includes Phase III and Phase IV treatments for Cushing's Syndrome and a Phase III treatment for ovarian cancer, among other things. Korlym has produced steadily growing revenue since 2019—including 48% revenue growth and 46% diluted net income per share growth in the third quarter of 2024. Conditions look good for the growth to continue. The company recently announced positive results from the treatment phase of its Catalyst study: Korlym reached its primary endpoint in patients with Cushing's Syndrome and hard-to-control type 2 diabetes. An earlier phase of Catalyst showed Cushing's is more common than previously thought. Corcept has also seen positive clinical trial results from a Phase III study of relacorilant, another treatment for Cushing's Syndrome. The EPS expectation for Corcept in 2024 is $1.39, which compares favorably to 2023 EPS of $0.94. For 2025, analysts believe the company will produce EPS of $1.79. You can wish for a prosperous new year, but strategic actions may get you there quicker. Start by reviewing your growth stock portfolio and replacing the duds with companies poised to shine in 2025.

Title: Could Bitcoin Become DeFi’s Collateral of Choice? Lombard Finance Says So
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/could-bitcoin-become-de-fi-s-collateral-of-choice-lombard-finance-says-so
Time Published: 2024-12-19T22:12:03Z
Full Content:
A war for on-chain market dominance may be brewing. The question: What will be the collateral of choice in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy? As of press time, DeFi protocols across all ecosystems have locked in almost $126 billion in value, according to DeFiLlama data, inching closer every day to their 2021 high of $175 billion. The majority of those pledged funds take the form of ether (ETH) and derivatives like yield-producing staked ether liquid tokens (stETH) and wrapped eETH (weETH), with wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and stablecoins as a whole competing for fourth and fifth place. But the team behind Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol Lombard Finance intends to shake things up with LBTC, a new liquid bitcoin token. The idea, according to Lombard co-founder Jacob Philips, is to dethrone ETH and stETH and install bitcoin as the collateral of choice in the entire on-chain economy. “On centralized venues, bitcoin is the prime collateral. There's no question about this. Why is it not the case in DeFi?” Philips told CoinDesk in an interview. “Bitcoin only does one thing well, and it's being a rock-solid store of value. It is the perfect collateral. There's no reason that we shouldn't be building DeFi on top of bitcoin.” Bitcoin has had a formidable year, surging 124% since January 1 thanks to political tailwinds in the U.S. and the massive success of its almost year-old spot exchange-traded funds. Ether, for its part, has underperformed significantly by “only” rising 48% in the same period of time, despite being four times smaller in terms of market capitalization. With demand for bitcoin increasing by the day — and ever-increasing chatter about a potential U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve under the incoming Trump administration — it isn’t crazy to think the asset could play a bigger role on-chain. That, in turn, could transform the way DeFi as a whole operates. “Bitcoin is going to be the next big source of liquidity for every DeFi protocol, on every chain. It’s just a massive influx of net new capital,” Philips said. Noting that bitcoin has a market cap close to $1.9 trillion, he said: “Even if we only get a fraction of that, it would still put a ton of new activity into the ecosystem and make DeFi more efficient — maybe even get to the point where DeFi protocols, through passive liquidity, rival the liquidity on centralized exchanges.” A big difference between bitcoin and ether is that you can lock in the latter asset on the Ethereum network — a process called staking — to help secure the blockchain, and earn interest, paid in ETH. At press time, staked ether offers a 3.19% yield annually, according to CoinDesk's composite ether staking rate (CESR) index. The Bitcoin network doesn’t offer such capabilities, but Lombard aims to provide a yield-bearing bitcoin token through Babylon, a protocol designed to let users stake bitcoin in order to secure other blockchains. It goes like this: Users give Lombard some bitcoin, Lombard stakes these coins through Babylon, then it mints one LBTC token for each BTC staked. These LBTC tokens follow the ERC-20 standard, meaning they can be used across Ethereum and all of its protocols. That interest rate on LBTC will be paid by the blockchains secured through Babylon, or so the theory goes. Nine different projects — Corn, BOB, Cosmos Hub, Nubit, Fiamma, Manta, LayerEdge, Chakra and Pell — have started or completed integration to Babylon’s blockchain development environment, or devnet, so far, Coleman Maher, growth lead at Babylon, told CoinDesk. These integrations should go live next year, after Babylon’s own layer 1 goes live. Babylon isn’t giving out any staking rewards right now, but that hasn’t prevented the protocol from accumulating $5.4 billion in value, making it the 10th biggest protocol by value locked across all of DeFi, according to DeFiLlama. So why are people so eager to lock up their bitcoin on Babylon? Possibly because it’s running a points program, meaning that early depositors could eventually receive an airdrop. The Babylon team did not comment on whether a token would ever be issued. Out of the $6 billion staked on Babylon, over $1.4 billion was plugged through Lombard to create LBTC tokens. In the absence of Babylon-issued staking rewards, these tokens aren’t providing any yield yet. “Users aren't choosing to hold ether or bitcoin based on staking yield alone,” Philips said. “There are much broader reasons why they're choosing one or the other," such as the potential U.S. bitcoin reserve and regulators’ views towards the two assets. "And the yield is a little bit of a cherry on top.” It’s important to note that DeFi users already can use bitcoin as collateral (although without any yield) thanks to wrapped bitcoin. At press time, wBTC’s market capitalization stood at $12.9 billion. That’s only 22% away from its 2021 all-time-high, despite concerns that wBTC’s issuer, crypto custody and trading firm BitGo, is sharing custody of the underlying bitcoin with BiT Global, an entity partially owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. Sun has been accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S. Even so, as of December 6, wBTC only accounted for $5.7 billion worth of collateral in some of the largest DeFi protocols, per Lido data, whereas $14.5 billion in ETH was being used, and $11.1 billion worth of stETH. Even "wrapped ether," or eETH — a relatively new liquid token that allows users to benefit from EigenLayer restaking rewards at the same time as native ETH staking yield — provided $5.8 billion in collateral. In fact, stETH and weETH have been slowly eating into other coins’ market share, to the point that ARK Invest stated in a recent report that the entire DeFi economy was reorganizing itself around stETH and the benchmark yield provided by staked ETH. Other tokens — like Solana’s SOL or Avalanche’s AVAX — offer higher interest rates for staking, the implication being that these assets, being more volatile, are riskier to hold in the long run. Stablecoin lenders have also felt pressure from stETH’s ascent, ARK Invest said, with Sky (SKY) (formerly MakerDAO) increasing locked DAI’s interest rate, while rewards for lending stablecoins on Aave (AAVE) and Compound (COMP) have grown, because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins than lend stablecoins directly. Not to mention the various tokenized money market funds being developed by financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, which could end up allowing DeFi users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills and use such tokens as collateral. So LBTC is facing tough competition. But Philips says the token can succeed where wBTC has struggled thanks to that extra little push afforded by its yield. “Staking yield will be generated in time. The LBTC yield is expected to be in the range of the ETH staking rate,” he said. “Lombard’s initial goal is just to get people to take their bitcoin out of the coldest of cold storage, and just take the most primitive step into on-chain finance. And then we'll show you the battle-tested protocols, safer than your bank, that exist out there,” Philips added. “It's possible that the yield could dry up. LBTC as an asset, producing any amount of yield, would still be an attractive asset.” The pitch has certainly been met with interest. Lombard raised $16 million this summer from a number of heavy-hitters, including Polychain Capital, Franklin Templeton and Nomad Capital. Philips said that entities already familiar with DeFi had been the most enthusiastic. “Anybody who has dabbled in crypto already, it's an easy pitch to get them onboard for bitcoin staking. Or at least they're very open to the conversation.” Tom was sucked into crypto in 2020 and is very much enjoying the ride. Now a markets reporter for CoinDesk, he previously wrote for DL News about bitcoin ETFs, the Federal Reserve, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University and can usually be found in Costa Rica. He holds BTC, ETH and SOL above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000.

Mo Shaikh, co-founder of Aptos Labs, announced that he's stepping down as CEO of the company. Aptos is a layer-1 blockchain that claims to offer enhanced scalability, security and transaction speeds. The platform leverages a unique blockchain programming language called Move, which was originally created for Facebook’s shuttered "Diem" project. In a lengthy post on X, Shaikh, who co-founded Aptos with Avery Ching three years ago, expressed pride in the progress made by the company, which included raising a mammoth $400 million in venture capital funding and building "one of the most robust ecosystems, trusted by over a thousand builders and innovators around the globe." For as long as I can remember, I’ve been passionate about building systems that empower people—fairer, more open systems. Since 2016, I have been deeply involved in the blockchain world, both exploring and contributing to its transformative social and economic potential. Three… Ching, Shaikh said, will assume the role of CEO and lead the company into its next phase of growth. In his X post, Shaikh acknowledged the work of Aptos' partners and investors, including firms like BlackRock, Google, Mastercard and PayPal. "None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support of our incredible investors. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Dragonfly, Blocktower, Haun Ventures, Hashed, IRONGREY, a16z, Apollo, Coinbase, Parafi, Scribble, PayPal, Franklin Templeton, and the amazing angels who believed in our vision," he wrote. Shaikh said he will remain with the company as a strategic adviser and plans to take time to reflect on the future of blockchain and financial systems. "I will always remain a champion of Aptos and its mission," he wrote, adding that he will "look forward to continuing to help Aptos maintain its role as the world's leading blockchain."

Title: Jim Cramer on Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): ‘I See Things Going Back To Normal For Eli Lilly’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-eli-lilly-company-212211526.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently reflected on how investors often overlook obvious opportunities, particularly with cult stocks, which in hindsight appear to be clear success stories. He discussed how, sometimes, the fundamentals that guide traditional investing can hold investors back from seizing these opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that many investors, himself included, have missed out on these types of stocks and emphasized that it’s important to examine why these opportunities were missed to avoid making the same mistake again. He mentioned that, early on, he and others mistakenly believed that fundamentals were always the key to making sound investments, only to realize that in certain situations, that’s not the case. Cramer highlighted that in the case of cult stocks, the stock price can sometimes move independently of the company’s underlying performance. These stocks can experience long-term growth due to a fiercely loyal shareholder base, and as a result, they may not follow traditional market behavior. He explained that while meme stocks might follow similar trends, cult stocks have staying power and can defy expectations. “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus Shifting the focus to the healthcare sector, Cramer noted that although the market has seen significant gains in recent weeks, it has become increasingly difficult to find promising investment opportunities. However, he believes that healthcare could be the place to look as 2025 approaches. Cramer explained that healthcare stocks have significantly underperformed this year, trailing behind the broader market, which has created an opportunity. “Now, it's hard to bet on healthcare when the Fed's cutting rates because these are textbook slowdown stocks and thrived when the economy was not doing so hot, but the election was also a clear negative catalyst for the group.” He noted that President-elect Trump’s potential appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is a major concern for the industry, especially given Kennedy’s reputation as a vaccine skeptic. Cramer also warned that if the second Trump administration attempts to dismantle Obamacare, it could lead to many Americans losing access to affordable health insurance, which would add further risk to healthcare stocks. Despite these concerns, Cramer believes that, at some point, all the negative factors will be factored into healthcare stocks, and that moment is fast approaching. He stated that the damage done to healthcare stocks, particularly in biotech and pharmaceuticals, has been severe, but he sees an opportunity as these stocks have become too cheap relative to their long-term potential. “With so many groups hitting new highs, I think it's worth taking a step back and putting money to work in one of the most hated groups out there, healthcare. These stocks have simply gotten too cheap given its prospects, especially Eli Lilly, Vertex Pharma, and Bristol-Myers.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 16. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An array of pharmaceutical pills with the company's logo on the bottle. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106 Cramer noted that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is being careful with its promotion and predicted that the company will be back to its full strength soon enough. “Eli Lilly is at the top of the list. Now we own this one for the Charitable Trust and it's earned, it’s nearly [at] $740 billion market cap. But with the stock in the high $700s, it has pulled back almost 20% from its highs in late August. As recently as late October, this stock was still sitting in the low $900s. But Lilly got hit real hard after reporting a seemingly not-so-hot quarter. And then it got hit again after the election, reportedly on an idea that RFK Jr. is not a fan of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Lilly's Mounjaro. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), a leading global pharmaceutical company, is recognized for its extensive range of treatments, particularly in the areas of diabetes and obesity. The company has gained significant attention for its diabetes medication Mounjaro and its companion drug for chronic weight management, Zepbound. These products have rapidly become key drivers of its growth. Reporting its third quarter, the company stated that U.S. sales of both Mounjaro and Zepbound were impacted negatively due to a reduction in inventories within the wholesaler channel. It should be noted that the sales of both drugs were still strong. Mounjaro alone was responsible for 27.3% of the total revenue, reflecting a remarkable 121% growth compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Zepbound also made a substantial impact, accounting for more than 11% of the revenue in that period. The company’s CFO, Lucas Montarce, mentioned during the earnings call that wholesalers had reduced inventories of diabetes and obesity medications, describing this as a temporary issue. Looking ahead to 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) revised its earnings forecast, expecting a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, down from its prior projection of $16.10 to $16.60. This change is largely due to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings. Lastly, the company is anticipating data from late-stage trials on its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, with results expected in April 2025, according to a top executive at the company. The pill belongs to a class of medications called incretins, which are designed to replicate the effects of the GLP-1 hormone. This hormone helps control blood sugar levels, slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach, and reduces appetite. Overall LLY ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

$1 Billion Share Repurchases Completed During QuarterFull-Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Outlook RevisedFedEx Completes FedEx Freight Assessment, Will Pursue Full Separation and Create a New Publicly Traded LTL Company MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the second quarter ended November 30 (adjusted measures exclude the item listed below): Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP) As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP)Revenue $22.0 billion $22.0 billion $22.2 billion $22.2 billionOperating income $1.05 billion $1.38 billion $1.28 billion $1.42 billionOperating margin 4.8% 6.3% 5.8% 6.4%Net income $0.74 billion $0.99 billion $0.90 billion $1.01 billionDiluted EPS $3.03 $4.05 $3.55 $3.99This year's and last year's quarterly consolidated results have been adjusted for:Impact per diluted share Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024Business optimization costs $1.02 $0.44Our second quarter results demonstrate that our efforts to transform our operations are working. The Federal Express segment delivered operating profit growth despite several headwinds, including the continued weak U.S. domestic demand environment as well as the expiration of our U.S. Postal Service contract, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief executive officer. I am proud of the team for continuing to deliver solid service to our customers throughout the Peak season, as we create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Consolidated operating results were negatively affected by lower-than-expected FedEx Freight revenue and profit, as sustained weakness in U.S. industrial production continued to pressure less-than-truckload industry demand. The lower FedEx Freight results were mostly offset by cost reduction benefits at Federal Express from DRIVE program initiatives and higher base yields at each transportation segment. Federal Express segment adjusted operating results improved during the quarter, driven by cost reduction benefits from DRIVE, higher base yield, and increased international export volume. These factors were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract for transportation services on September 29, 2024, and U.S. domestic package demand weakness. FedEx Freight segment operating results decreased during the quarter due to fewer shipments, lower fuel surcharges, and reduced weight per shipment, partially offset by higher base yield. Last year's second quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of facilities. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting second quarter results by $0.07 per diluted share. The company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during fiscal 2025, for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the company's 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on-hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion. FedEx Freight Assessment Earlier today, FedEx announced that its Board of Directors has concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The separation is expected to be achieved in a tax-efficient manner for FedEx stockholders and executed within the next 18 months. Additional information can be found in the related press release at investors.fedex.com. Outlook FedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2025 mark-to-market ("M™") retirement plans accounting adjustments. As a result, FedEx is unable to provide a fiscal 2025 earnings per share ("EPS") or effective tax rate ("ETR") outlook on a GAAP basis and is relying on the exemption provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). It is reasonably possible that the fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. FedEx is revising its fiscal 2025 revenue and earnings forecasts, and now expects:Approximately flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase;Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share; andETR of approximately 24.0% prior to the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, compared to the prior forecast of approximately 24.5%.FedEx is reaffirming its forecast of:Permanent cost reductions from the DRIVE transformation program of $2.2 billion; andCapital spending of $5.2 billion, with a priority on investments in network optimization and efficiency improvement, including fleet and facility modernization and automation.These forecasts assume the company's current economic forecast and fuel price expectations, successful completion of the planned stock repurchases, and no additional adverse economic or geopolitical developments. FedEx's ETR and EPS forecasts are based on current law and related regulations and guidance. I remain confident FedEx will continue to grow earnings this year despite the challenging demand environment, as we focus on transforming operations and improving revenue quality, said John Dietrich, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. We are resolute in our strategy to prudently manage our capital expenditures, and expect to deliver on our commitment to return $3.8 billion to stockholders this fiscal year. Corporate Overview FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. With annual revenue of $87 billion, the company offers integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network.

The financial section of this release is provided on the company's website at investors.fedex.com.RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses.

(NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the second quarter ended November 30 (adjusted measures exclude the item listed below): Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP) As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP) Revenue $22.0 billion $22.0 billion $22.2 billion $22.2 billion Operating income $1.05 billion $1.38 billion $1.28 billion $1.42 billion Operating margin 4.8% 6.3% 5.8% 6.4% Net income $0.74 billion $0.99 billion $0.90 billion $1.01 billion Diluted EPS $3.03 $4.05 $3.55 $3.99 This year's and last year's quarterly consolidated results have been adjusted for: Impact per diluted share Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 Business optimization costs $1.02 $0.44 Our second quarter results demonstrate that our efforts to transform our operations are working. The Federal Express segment delivered operating profit growth despite several headwinds, including the continued weak U.S. domestic demand environment as well as the expiration of our U.S. Postal Service contract, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief executive officer. I am proud of the team for continuing to deliver solid service to our customers throughout the Peak season, as we create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Consolidated operating results were negatively affected by lower-than-expected FedEx Freight revenue and profit, as sustained weakness in U.S. industrial production continued to pressure less-than-truckload industry demand. The lower FedEx Freight results were mostly offset by cost reduction benefits at Federal Express from DRIVE program initiatives and higher base yields at each transportation segment. Federal Express segment adjusted operating results improved during the quarter, driven by cost reduction benefits from DRIVE, higher base yield, and increased international export volume. These factors were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract for transportation services on September 29, 2024, and U.S. domestic package demand weakness. FedEx Freight segment operating results decreased during the quarter due to fewer shipments, lower fuel surcharges, and reduced weight per shipment, partially offset by higher base yield. Last year's second quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of facilities. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting second quarter results by $0.07 per diluted share. The company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during fiscal 2025, for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the company's 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on-hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion. FedEx Freight Assessment Earlier today, FedEx announced that its Board of Directors has concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The separation is expected to be achieved in a tax-efficient manner for FedEx stockholders and executed within the next 18 months. Additional information can be found in the related press release at investors.fedex.com. Outlook FedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2025 mark-to-market ("M™") retirement plans accounting adjustments. As a result, FedEx is unable to provide a fiscal 2025 earnings per share ("EPS") or effective tax rate ("ETR") outlook on a GAAP basis and is relying on the exemption provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). It is reasonably possible that the fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. FedEx is revising its fiscal 2025 revenue and earnings forecasts, and now expects: FedEx is reaffirming its forecast of: These forecasts assume the company's current economic forecast and fuel price expectations, successful completion of the planned stock repurchases, and no additional adverse economic or geopolitical developments. FedEx's ETR and EPS forecasts are based on current law and related regulations and guidance. I remain confident FedEx will continue to grow earnings this year despite the challenging demand environment, as we focus on transforming operations and improving revenue quality, said John Dietrich, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. We are resolute in our strategy to prudently manage our capital expenditures, and expect to deliver on our commitment to return $3.8 billion to stockholders this fiscal year.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2025 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2025. Our fiscal 2025 ETR forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures.

Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet

Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet

Time Published: 2024-12-19T21:05:23Z
Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet.

Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter.

According to Philip Tong’s family, Amazon’s One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent.” Tong died in an emergency room hours after a One Medical telehealth provider advised him to buy an inhaler to treat symptoms including shortness of breath and coughing up blood. Share Options A California family sued Amazon-owned telehealth provider One Medical and a local hospital and physician, alleging they were “reckless and negligent” in their care of a 45-year-old man who died after seeking help via an online appointment. According to the complaint, 45-year-old Philip Tong scheduled an online appointment with Amazon One Medical on Dec. 18, 2023. Tong complained of shortness of breath and said he was coughing up blood and that his feet had turned blue. One Medical advised him to purchase an inhaler. Hours later, Tong visited the emergency room at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, where he collapsed and died. Tong’s wife, Suzanne, and his two daughters filed suit Oct. 1 in Alameda County Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Amazon One Medical, Alta Bates Summit and Dr. Aurelia A. Cheng of medical malpractice and wrongful death. The plaintiffs allege One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent” in its treatment of Tong, by “failing to appropriately undertake to care for or recommend care, order testing and providing proper treatment for the plaintiff.” At the time of his appointment, Tong had been sick with flu-like symptoms for about a week and was suffering from “uncontrolled diabetes, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, infection and sepsis,” according to the lawsuit. The case remained under the media’s radar until The Washington Post reported the story Wednesday. According to the Post, this “appears to be the first wrongful-death suit to be brought against One Medical, which Amazon acquired in February 2023.” The Post cited Suzanne’s remarks from her husband’s Dec. 28, 2023, funeral: “No one expected a 45-year-old man who had the flu to suddenly be dead … And to have him taken so quickly, so unexpectedly — there are no words.” The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages to be determined at trial. A hearing in the case is scheduled for March 2025. Your support helps fund this work, and CHD’s related advocacy, education and scientific research. Donate Now Training of telehealth providers ‘in its infancy’ In a statement cited by the Post, Amazon One Medical spokesperson Samantha Kruse said the company is “prohibited by law from discussing patient records.” “We care deeply about every patient we serve, and the quality and safety of our care are our highest priorities,” Kruse said. “We’re proud of our extensive quality and safety measures, and of the health outcomes we help our patients achieve. We take concerns about our care extremely seriously, and we’re committed to continuous improvement.” Legal experts told The Defender the case will come down to what the evidence will demonstrate about causation. “The timing and delay will be a factual issue and will impact causation and harm,” California-based healthcare attorney Rick Jaffe told The Defender. “The medical records, including the recording of the intake call, could sink or save both facilities.” Jaffe added: “Once a patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and recent splitting-up blood, and a diagnosis of sepsis, there’s no role for online medical care other than to say to go immediately to the ER, which is what the patient did apparently.” Pediatrician Dr. Michelle Perro told The Defender that while telehealth provides certain benefits to patients, it can’t replace physical examinations in cases like Tong’s. She said: “While clearly telehealth has many advantages in terms of increasing patient access to care, a foundational tenet of the practice of medicine is doing a thorough physical exam … Although practitioners may not be trained in telehealth, any provider should be able to realize the gravity of Mr. Tong’s reported symptoms. “Upon reviewing the health history of Mr. Tong and establishing the seriousness of his complaints, there should have been an immediate prompt to have him come in for an in-person assessment directly to an urgent care or emergency setting.” Noting the increased prevalence of telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender, “The ‘pandemic’ continues to degrade our quality of life.” Flores said he doesn’t oppose telehealth for routine issues. In California, physicians are still held to the same standard of care, he said. “But, in instances when, as alleged in the complaint, the deceased was simply told to take an inhaler even though he was coughing up blood, was short of breath and had blue feet, this practice of medicine becomes a travesty.” Jaffe, who suggested that telehealth is “all about triage and screening,” said there “have to be systems in place where even the telephone operators have to be trained to make quick and accurate screening of patients and moving them to an ER or urgent care center.” He said the discovery process for the lawsuit should focus on that training and those systems. “The recorded call will be very important, and perhaps the critical piece of evidence,” he said. Simon Rowland, a researcher with consumer health company Haleon and expert in telehealth and malpractice, told the Post that few telehealth providers receive special training in issuing remote diagnoses to patients. “Training in that area is in its infancy,” Rowland said. “It’s a clinical scenario that people need to understand better in terms of the risks and benefits.” For Patrick M. Wood, author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse Of Global Transformation,” telehealth’s reliance on standardized protocols will hurt patient care. “Standardized protocols and ‘best practices’ will always marginalize human judgment in those cases that fall outside their scope, often with devastating consequences,” Wood told The Defender. ‘Profit motive can lead to grave errors’ According to the Post, Amazon has pushed to expand its presence in telehealth since it finalized its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in 2023. This includes efforts to combine One Medical’s services with those offered by its own telehealth service, previously known as Amazon Clinic, the Daily Mail reported. Amazon also operates an online pharmacy, Amazon Pharmacy, which arose out of its acquisition of PillPack in 2018 for $750 million, according to the Daily Mail. At a recent Amazon media event, One Medical CEO Trent Green said the company plans to increase online primary care services, including making telehealth appointments available on nights, weekends and holidays, the Post reported. “By building, testing, and scaling new models of care delivery we can help reduce costs, improve outcomes, and fundamentally transform health care,” Green said. According to the Daily Mail, One Medical has more than 800,000 members and operates over 200 medical offices in more than 20 markets. Amazon’s foray into healthcare previously encountered obstacles. According to the Daily Mail, Haven — a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — aimed at lowering employee healthcare costs, was discontinued in 2021.

According to the Post, “As One Medical has grown under Amazon’s ownership, it has sometimes struggled to adequately care for its more vulnerable patients.” In February, Amazon One Medical announced layoffs, including of some of its clinical staff, and moved more of its patient care and communication online. The layoffs included clinical reception staff who were replaced by an Arizona-based call center. According to the Post, One Medical employees said this “put patients at risk.” In June, leaked documents revealed that Amazon One Medical staff repeatedly mishandled urgent calls from patients experiencing life-threatening symptoms. The Post reported that current and former employees have alleged “pressure to improve productivity” increased after Amazon’s purchase of One Medicine. “Virtual providers’ schedules were so tightly packed, one former employee said, that two different patients reported having telehealth visits with health-care providers who were clearly calling from their cars,” the Post reported. Jaffe said he expects “more of these cases to be filed against online companies as the telehealth model expands and more players come into the market.” Perro voiced concerns about the encroachment of non-medical organizations into healthcare. “The constant push for medical providers to see more patients and quickly make assessments driven by the profit motive can lead to grave errors.” Wood suggested that “so-called ‘evidence-based medicine’ paved the way for the technocratic takeover” of healthcare starting in the 1990s, forcing out human-based medicine. “Bad outcomes like this case are a marker of evidence-based medicine, which empowers technocrats to overuse technology at the expense of common sense.” Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D., based in Athens, Greece, is a senior reporter for The Defender and part of the rotation of hosts for CHD.TV's "Good Morning CHD."

Title: Micron (MU) Tumbles after Guidance Comes in Way Below the Street’s Outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The shares of Micron (MU) are sinking 16% after the company provided significantly weaker-than-expected guidance for its current quarter. Micron develops and markets computer memory products. In fiscal Q2, the company's current quarter, the company expects its adjusted earnings per share to come in at $1.33 to $1.53. Analysts' average estimate was $1.92. Similarly, Micron predicted that it would generate Q2 sales of $7.7 billion to $8.1 billion, versus the mean estimate of $9 billion. Further, it provided adjusted gross margin guidance for Q2 of 37.5%-39.5%, versus analysts' average estimate of 41.3%. Micron blamed the guidance misses on weak consumer-oriented markets. The company's chips are widely utilized in PCs and cell phones. However, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the firm is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” For Q1, its previous quarter, Micron generated adjusted EPS of $1.79, versus analysts' mean outlook of $1.77. Additionally, its sales soared 84% year-over-year, driven by high demand for its products from data centers and the strong performance of its high-bandwidth memory offerings. However, many banks cut their price targets on MU stock in the wake of the guidance misses. Bank of America, for example, lowered its rating on the shares to Neutral from Buy and slashed its price target on the shares to $110 from $125. The bank reported that there is "downward pressure" on prices for Micron's memory products due to "weakness in PC and phone markets." While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Crypto And Digital Assets Shine At ADFW24: Abu Dhabi, the Capital Of Capital Connectors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2024/12/19/crypto-and-digital-assets-shine-at-adfw24-abu-dhabi-the-capital-of-capital-connectors/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T19:45:27Z
Full Content:
ADFW24 Main Stage In its third iteration, Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) 2024, saw over 20,000 conference delegates, twice the number of 2023, convene from December 9 to 11 at the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) campus at ADGM Square on Al Maryah Island in Abu Dhabi. ADFW convenes many of the world’s innovative capitalists from banking, asset management, and fintech on par with Davos or Milken’s LA Conference. The number of events running across the week covered themes like economics, capital markets, blockchain, investment, fintech, family offices, sustainable investing, and Islamic Finance, to name a few. Speakers included the chief executives of Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Citigroup, BNY, Lunate, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Aldar. Monday of the conference, the first day, is a veritable who's who to rub shoulders with on the intimate ADGM campus while recovering from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix F1 celebrations the evening before. In addition to the cadre of CEOs, legends like Ray Dalio can be found circulating alongside rising statesmen like Eric Trump, grabbing the attention of many for selfies. Trump's crisp and eloquent narrative on the utility of bitcoin as a strategic reserve to be used to pay down national debt in both open and closed door sessions also impressed many. ADFW24 saw eight global institutions, representing $635 billion announce they are setting up shop in Abu Dhabi, building on the $450 billion in commitments during last year’s ADFW23, and confirming ADGM’s status as the region’s fastest growing global financial centre. H.E. Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi, Member of Abu Dhabi’s Executive Council & Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) and ADGM commented, “These milestones reflect the heart of what makes Abu Dhabi so special—a shared vision of progress, partnership, and possibility. The growing number of global financial leaders and innovators choosing ADGM is a testament to the trust they place in our infrastructure, robust regulations, commitment to excellence and Abu Dhabi’s reputation as the world’s safest and most dynamic jurisdiction for asset and wealth management. "As we welcome these new partnerships, we remain dedicated to driving the growth and diversification of the ‘Falcon Economy’ and creating opportunities that resonate across industries and borders. It’s an exciting moment for ADGM, Abu Dhabi, and all those who are part of this remarkable journey.” Chris Hughes, the editor-in-chief of ADFW, and his team must take a bow again this year on another outstanding ADFW, which grows from strength to strength. Hughes kicked off the afternoon session on the first day of the conference with a video interview with Larry Fink, chairman and ceo of Blackrock, recorded for the event. On this year's growth of ADGM, Fink commented, “It's been a long journey watching how Abu Dhabi has matured as an economy. The constant innovation that I'm seeing from the economy and from the leadership. And Abu Dhabi has really positioned itself to become a leader over the next 20 years. Its psychology was different, and now it's blossoming into this magnet of opportunity. With that strength, it is now becoming a foundation for innovation.” Hughes followed with a live fireside chat with Jaap Kalkman, the group chief investment officer of ADQ, one of the Emirates three sovereign wealth funds which include Mubadala and Adia, collectively managing $1.7 trillion in assets - Abu Dhabi is ranked as the world's the top city for sovereign wealth fund capital. ADQ has launched a new report, "A New Era of Capital Flows in a Polycentric World", in collaboration with ADFW and ADGM, and with Stern at NYU Abu Dhabi serving as academic advisor. The report explores the idea that the world is on the brink of a new era of capital flows. What is clear from listening to policymakers and asset allocators at ADFW is that Abu Dhabi is positioning the hub as a connector to the world's major financial centres. Hughes, one of the most connected people in the global financial services sector, said, "2024 was quite a year. Starting with Global Roadshows to far away places like the US, China, France, Switzerland, U.K. and more, to an unprecedented influx of investors setting up in the Capital, we finished the year by producing the breakout launch edition of Abu Dhabi Business Week for 12,500 people, and the biggest ever edition of Abu Dhabi Finance Week." There were a number of announcements that caught the attention of the global blockchain community. With the Bitcoin Mena conference running at the same time down the road and CZ popping in for a visit, the prevalence of crypto and digital assets left its mark on ADFW. Many market pundits have concluded that stablecoins are the the killer app in digital assets delivering the fiat on and off ramps to Web3.0. Paxos announced it has partnered with Standard Chartered to strengthen supporting the Global Dollar (USDG) and Lift Dollar (USDL) in Singapore and the UAE. Adam Ackermann, head of treasury and portfolio management at Paxos, said: “As the stablecoin industry continues to attract the world’s leading enterprises, it’s more important than ever to ensure they have access to sophisticated, institutional-grade products. Standard Chartered’s commitment to risk management, compliance and operational efficiency across its world-class banking solutions is critical to Paxos as a regulated stablecoin issuer.“ Circle announced plans for expansion and partnership with Binance on USDC to accelerate crypto adoption and their MENA hub in Abu Dhabi. Commenting on the partnership, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, said, "The partnership demonstrates the maturation of our industry, with the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, with 250 million end users, and USDC, the world's most trusted regulated digital dollar." ADGM Polygon Labs announced a collaboration focused on developing international disclosure standards that ensure transparency, security, and trust within the Web3 and broader blockchain ecosystem. Rebecca Rettig, Peter Kerstens, Elise Soucie Watts. and Lawrence Wintermeyer Rebecca Rettig, of Polygon Labs commented, "It's been pretty amazing to work with the government here, and see how they are thinking about things, both to have regulatory guard rails, and to have innovate companies in the space." eToro announced that has partnered with ADX, the region's stock exchange, to expand investment opportunities in the UAE. eToro’s users will be able to invest in a number of ADX-listed companies across various sectors, including energy, real estate, banking, finance, technology, and healthcare. ADX is one of the world’s fastest-growing exchanges that ranks among the top 20 globally in terms of market capitalization. Yoni Assia, co-founder and ceo at eToro, commented, “We are excited to announce our partnership with the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, enabling eToro users to trade ADX-listed stocks. Since our founding in 2007, we’ve built a global, multi-asset investment offering and today offer our users from 75 countries the ability to trade in equities from more than 20 stock exchanges.” Fintech.TV and Finstreet are joining forces to empower investors with the knowledge and insights necessary to navigate the complexities of today's financial markets. Finstreet is a global financial markets infrastructure business, designed to revolutionize the way capital is allocated, wealth is created, and investments are managed across global markets. FintechTV founder and ceo Vince Molinari broadcasting live to NYSE from ADFW24- Commenting on the collaboration, Vince Molinari, founder and ceo of FintechTV said, "This collaboration will focus on promoting Finstreet’s vision and developing cutting-edge content together that addresses the most pressing challenges and opportunities facing investors." Fintstreet received its ADGM green light to launch a blockchain platform for digital multilateral trading facility (MTF), central securities depository, and a private financing platform in September. Zodia Markets got the green light during ADFW24 and was granted permission to operate as a regulated virtual asset brokerage in ADGM, while the Aptos Foundation expanded into ADGM with plans to use its office as a base for expanding across the region. ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), the progressive Emirates regulator, has recently announced new frameworks dedicated to crypto and digital assets. The FSRA is run by ceo Emmanuel Givanakis, a 10 year veteran of ADGM with a pedigree in policy and law, and an eye for innovation in conduct regulators. The FSRA's former ceo is Richard Teng, now the ceo of Binance. Givanakis commented, "We have recently released our fiat-reference token framework which is a stablecoin framework, we have a lot of firms from North America wanting to issue stablecoins from ADGM. This week, we have come out with a consultation paper for our virtual asset framework, and how we are going to enhance it. "Abu Dhabi and its economy are growing, and the global influence is helping it to internally diversifying itself, and outwardly projecting itself to the world."

Title: Cramer Impressed by GE Vernova (GEV) Performance Post-Spin-Off Amid Clean Energy Demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 Stocks That Jim Cramer Recently Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to talk about the incoming Trump administration’s tariffs. Coupled with the Fed’s data-driven interest rates cycle, tariffs have created quite a stir on Wall Street as investors are wary of them contributing to inflationary pressures and making the central bank hesitate when it comes to reducing rates. He believes that one of the key issues surrounding tariffs is the interconnection between the US and China. Cramer shared that “I know many business people have talked to President-elect Trump and they’ve said, ‘It’s not as simple as steel. Steel’s a hundred thousand people, I mean some of these companies have three hundred, four hundred thousand people themselves. I think the problem is we’re so intertwined and a lot of people felt, you know what, when President Trump, or when he was President Trump, you basically felt you were supposed to go from China to Mexico. Seemed like a good deal. And Mexico seemed like, favored.” Since then, Cramer shared that the sentiment around Mexico has changed. According to him, the same people are now wondering “Why did we go to this country that apparently doesn’t like.” He also shed light on the relationship between China and Mexico and shared that “China and Mexico are strange bedfellows. China’s been flooding the country with autos! And, what we did was we moved all of our auto production down there! Also Germany, you go to Puebla, and it’s Volkswagen!” He added that this makes implementing tariffs tricky as “it’s just that the cars go back and forth, and back and forth, where, where do we put the tariff on? Where to we take it off?” However, while the market might be worried about the broader impact of tariffs, businesses are also excited about growing merger and acquisition activity. Cramer outlined that “very quickly, people just say, you know what, look, tariffs are so convoluted that something has to happen. But the idea that they can talk to other companies and maybe combine, they want that so badly.” Apart from his takes on stocks, some of Cramer’s most controversial views are of cryptocurrencies. While he doesn’t advocate completely shunning them, the tight-knit crypto community either panics when he’s bullish for Bitcoin due to the well-known inverse Cramer effect or wonders why he doesn’t advocate holding more crypto as part of a portfolio. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer shared some of his latest thoughts about crypto: “I’ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world’s lunacy. But for years now, I’ve also been saying Bitcoin’s a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don’t want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer reiterated that there’s more to investing than simply “just owning cryptocurrencies.” In fact, he believes that buying stocks can potentially lead to an investor making more money than buying cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin’s part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history,” believes Cramer. “Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Another Mad Money episode saw him stress that he has held Bitcoin for years as Cramer shared: “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do—not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let’s dispel the idea that I’ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.” To make our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about, we listed down stocks he commented on during at latest episode of CNBC’s Squawk on the Street and tweeted about. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Copyright: bee32 / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a fresh company formed after the spin-off of General Electric’s energy division earlier this year. Since the spin-off, the shares have gained 157% to make it one of the best-performing stocks of the year. Cramer referred to GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) as part of his remarks for Honeywell as he was impressed by the firm’s performance after the split. GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) benefits from the growing demand for clean energy, particularly from AI data centers. The firm has been focused on refocusing efforts away from its wind generation business to better cater to the rising demand for clean energy. Commenting on GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV), Cramer shared that the firm’s CEO benefited from its surprising exposure to data centers: “Well he got the break that Vernonva turned out to be data center. A data center. But then you have to go throw cold water on it.” Overall, GEV ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) Faces Criticism from Cramer Amid High R&D Spending and Revenue Struggles

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 Stocks That Jim Cramer Recently Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to talk about the incoming Trump administration’s tariffs. Coupled with the Fed’s data-driven interest rates cycle, tariffs have created quite a stir on Wall Street as investors are wary of them contributing to inflationary pressures and making the central bank hesitate when it comes to reducing rates. He believes that one of the key issues surrounding tariffs is the interconnection between the US and China. Cramer shared that “I know many business people have talked to President-elect Trump and they’ve said, ‘It’s not as simple as steel. Steel’s a hundred thousand people, I mean some of these companies have three hundred, four hundred thousand people themselves. I think the problem is we’re so intertwined and a lot of people felt, you know what, when President Trump, or when he was President Trump, you basically felt you were supposed to go from China to Mexico. Seemed like a good deal. And Mexico seemed like, favored.” Since then, Cramer shared that the sentiment around Mexico has changed. According to him, the same people are now wondering “Why did we go to this country that apparently doesn’t like.” He also shed light on the relationship between China and Mexico and shared that “China and Mexico are strange bedfellows. China’s been flooding the country with autos! And, what we did was we moved all of our auto production down there! Also Germany, you go to Puebla, and it’s Volkswagen!” He added that this makes implementing tariffs tricky as “it’s just that the cars go back and forth, and back and forth, where, where do we put the tariff on? Where to we take it off?” However, while the market might be worried about the broader impact of tariffs, businesses are also excited about growing merger and acquisition activity. Cramer outlined that “very quickly, people just say, you know what, look, tariffs are so convoluted that something has to happen. But the idea that they can talk to other companies and maybe combine, they want that so badly.” Apart from his takes on stocks, some of Cramer’s most controversial views are of cryptocurrencies. While he doesn’t advocate completely shunning them, the tight-knit crypto community either panics when he’s bullish for Bitcoin due to the well-known inverse Cramer effect or wonders why he doesn’t advocate holding more crypto as part of a portfolio. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer shared some of his latest thoughts about crypto: “I’ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world’s lunacy. But for years now, I’ve also been saying Bitcoin’s a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don’t want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer reiterated that there’s more to investing than simply “just owning cryptocurrencies.” In fact, he believes that buying stocks can potentially lead to an investor making more money than buying cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin’s part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history,” believes Cramer. “Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Another Mad Money episode saw him stress that he has held Bitcoin for years as Cramer shared: “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do—not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let’s dispel the idea that I’ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.” To make our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about, we listed down stocks he commented on during at latest episode of CNBC’s Squawk on the Street and tweeted about. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) is the embattled biotechnology company that rose to global fame during the coronavirus pandemic. The firm’s fall from grace is the sharpest example you’ll find of the tough conditions in its industry. Pharma firms spend billions of dollars and years developing drugs. The heavy time and money investment means that their drugs have to generate value for years as well in order to recover costs and create space for developing new treatments. However, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic. It is aggressively investing in R&D, with TTM expenses being $4.8 billion. While investing in growth is good, the spending is just $200 million short of the firm’s revenue. Cramer isn’t too happy with Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) as he shared: “Moderna, I guess is one of the great fizzles I’ve ever seen.” Overall, MRNA ranks 14th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer in a lab coat examining a state-of-the-art semiconductor chip. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), a chip maker for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD, attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. Its advanced microprocessors have fueled business for TSMC immensely, keeping the hopes up of investors, especially after ASML cut down guidance. On October 17, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, Bob O’Donnell, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the position of TSMC. He shared that ASML cutting its guidance has more to do with challenges in China and much less with the semiconductor industry. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid financial performance, emphasizing that the company beat earnings and raised its guidance for 2025, suggesting that TSMC is a “much better bellwether” of AI. Overall, TSMC expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30% due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also plans to spend nearly $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects revenue from AI chips to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: BlackRock’s iShares ETF Makes History with Unique Blockchain-Backed Municipal Debt Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-ishares-etf-makes-history-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T18:30:05Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, successfully acquired municipal debt through a transaction that exclusively utilizes blockchain technology. According to a Bloomberg report, this marks the first instance of municipal bonds being purchased, settled, and held entirely on a blockchain platform. Per the report, the bonds were issued earlier this year by the city of Quincy, Massachusetts, and were underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The transaction was facilitated through an application on JPMorgan’s private, permissioned blockchain platform, known as Digital Debt Service. Interestingly, this approach not only streamlines the bond issuance process but also enhances transparency and security in municipal finance. BlackRock’s acquisition was made through its actively-managed exchange-traded fund, the iShares Short Maturity Municipal Bond Active ETF (MEAR). Since its inception in 2015, MEAR has attracted approximately $750 million in client assets. As part of this historic deal, BlackRock has taken a total position of $6.5 million in the Quincy bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pat Haskell, head of BlackRock’s municipal bond group, expressed optimism about the transaction, stating: The use of blockchain throughout the lifecycle of bonds is just one example of the potential for this technology to transform capital markets. This transaction marks a significant moment for the municipal bond market and is a testament to BlackRock’s dedication to innovation. The prospectus for MEAR was recently updated to permit the fund to invest in municipal bonds settled through JPMorgan’s blockchain application, as indicated in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission dated December 17. However, investors are cautioned about potential risks, including lack of liquidity and the possibility of errors or limitations inherent in the underlying computer code of the application. In recent years, several issuers and underwriters have explored the feasibility of blockchain technology in the municipal bond market. Notably, the board of trustees at Michigan State University considered a deal that would have utilized a proprietary digital assets platform developed by Goldman Sachs, highlighting a growing interest in integrating blockchain solutions within traditional finance. In the realm of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock has garnered significant attention, particularly due to ongoing inflows throughout the year. Notably, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has outperformed its gold ETF in terms of assets under management (AUM). According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, it took BlackRock’s gold ETF 20 years to reach $33 billion in AUM. In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF has nearly doubled that figure in less than a year, approaching the $60 billion milestone. This development occurs amid notable volatility in Bitcoin’s price over the past 48 hours, as traders anticipated the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate cuts. During this period, despite Bitcoin briefly falling below the $100,000 mark, BlackRock seized the opportunity to purchase $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, despite losing the key $100,000 milestone, Bitcoin has managed to recover this level and is currently trading at $101,240. However, the market’s leading crypto still posted losses of 2.3% in the 24-hour time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: All 7 Blackstone holiday videos ranked
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-holiday-videos-rankings-explanation
Time Published: 2024-12-19T17:31:45Z
Full Content:
Blackstone released its first satirical holiday video in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the company-wide holiday party, a tradition that was canceled because the firm had grown too large. Now, it's a viral sensation. Eight million people have viewed last year's video featuring Blackstone executives doing their best to match the success of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour with a pop song about alternative investments. It made headlines, with the Daily Mail questioning whether it was "the most cringeworthy corporate video ever." This year, the company doubled down on the singing (and introduced line-dancing) in its most ambitious (and outlandish) holiday video yet. It also featured 200 employees, up from just 20 in 2018, a testiment to the video's popularity within the firm. Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, joked that his role in producing the video has made him a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue. "People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'" Gillespie told Business Insider. "People are really into lobbying to be in it." If you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018. This video came out in December 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom "The Office," but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene one Blackstone executive has a hard time recognizing a colleague with out-of-control long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?) While it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to "I'm Walking on Sunshine," kicking off the tradition of holiday video songs, which have featured prominently since. Still, it's a bit stuck in the pandemic era, hence its place at No. 7. The conceit of this holiday season is fake news station "BX TV News" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.) Schwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos as the sincere elder statesman to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. But then, he notes that there is a secret hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana-Jones-referencing journey to find the scroll with the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video. The video successfully makes a number of self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company has been going with "The Office" theme for four years, hence its ranking. The budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo. The key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives "'Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm." The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, "I make one call to the FCC and they'll cancel this clown car."Employees chant "end it," and celebrate as they think Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. But instead, it's clear that 2022's BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call is still a weekly requirement at the firm. Scranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom "The Office" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like "The Office," there is hand-held camera work and plenty of "candid" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson. This video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic. The 2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of "The Office" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments. This is video that broke into the wider world, spawning more than a few mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series that's main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: "Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock." Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing some glittery fringe top. The 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone' absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence" Gray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads which still show up in holiday videos, and on some people's desks. We agree that that the mascot joke works, hence its ranking. This video also ends with one of the best Steve Schwarzman gags of the series, when it's revealed that Schwarzman has been the mysterious person inside Mr. Stone the whole time. After last year's reception, leaned in to the cringe with a metaverse-like exploration of Blackstone executives as reality television stars that ends in a country song-and-dance routine. It features appearances from famous friends. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which was originally created within Blackstone before spinning out in the 1990s, gets in a joke about how the two firms get confused for each other. An extended "Real Housewives" bit includes some shade from Jenna Lyons, "Real Housewives of New York" star, fashion designer and executive creative director at Fundamental Co, a branding agency spun out of Blackstone last year.The highlight, however, was billionaire founder and CEO Steve Schwarzman playing Kendall Jenner attempting to cut a cucumber, which has to be one of the most mind-bending images ever put on screen. (We are still struggling to fully process it.) Gray told BI that the turn to country was inspired by Beyonce's own embrace of the genre this year on "Cowboy Carter", which came in the wake of her 2016 snub by the Country Music Awards. And just like Beyonce, some of the firm's best work comes when they don't let the critics stop them. Jump to

Title: Health Insurance Execs Should Live in Fear of Prison, Not Murder
URL: https://theintercept.com/2024/12/19/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-insurance/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The U.S. political system is owned by corporations despised by the American people. Luigi Mangione is the result. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is a profoundly revealing moment in American politics. Not only has it opened the floodgates of public anger at health insurance companies, but it has also demonstrated just how avoidant most U.S. politicians are when it comes to acknowledging that anger or doing anything about it. The surge of online excitement surrounding the man accused of murdering Thompson, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, is a symptom of a much larger problem: an oligarchic U.S. political system that repeatedly fails to respond to the needs of the people. In the absence of effective government, vigilante violence becomes much more likely. Mangione has found popularity precisely because the man he is accused of killing ran a company that routinely boosted profits by pushing its customers closer to illness and death. Earlier this year, a U.S. Senate committee investigated UnitedHealthcare and determined that the insurance company frequently denied nursing care to patients who were recovering from falls and strokes in order to boost its profits. Health news platform Stat reported that a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary called NaviHealth systematically denied care for seriously ill seniors. Thompson himself was facing a class-action lawsuit for insider trading amid a Department of Justice investigation. Of course, it is easy to treat UnitedHealthcare’s abuses as the actions of just one evil company run by a handful of bad men. But these companies are owned by Wall Street. Institutional investors and shareholders reward and punish corporate executives based on the profits they generate and the share prices they produce. In causing harm to so many Americans, Thompson was meeting the demands of his corporate board members and the even wealthier interests that they serve. These profits generated by denying Americans medical care are in turn converted into campaign contributions and lobbying dollars that block our political system from doing anything about it. In 2023 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s political action committee reported donating $2.95 million to federal campaigns and spending $16.62 million on lobbying expenses. Meanwhile, the top federal recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group executives and employees was Kamala Harris. Perhaps this is why Harris flip-flopped on abolishing private health insurance during her first of two failed runs for president: she knew just how much money was on the table. Harris, of course, isn’t the only major recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group employees in 2024. The Democratic National Committee received $103,022; the Republican National Committee received $207,125; and the Trump campaign took in $144,297. And UnitedHealth Group is not alone. A quick review of other major health insurance companies demonstrates that each of them has spent heavily in recent campaign cycles to maintain a political system that responds to their corporate interests, while undermining the health of the American people. Perhaps this is why prominent Democratic politicians like Pennsylvania’s Sen. John Fetterman and Gov. Josh Shapiro were so quick to condemn the murder of Thompson, while saying little or nothing about the thousands of people who have been denied coverage for their medical care by UnitedHealthcare under Thompson’s management. And perhaps this has something to do with why New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a statement regarding the murder of Thompson and personally joined a virtual convening of some 175 corporate representatives who were concerned about their safety, but has said nothing regarding the insurance abuses of UnitedHealthcare. With Republicans about to control all three branches of the U.S. government, any real accountability for health insurance companies, including criminalization of their abuses, is highly unlikely. But even under the best of circumstances, we shouldn’t expect much from our status quo political system. The high-water mark of health care reform in recent American history was the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare.” Obama’s signature achievement was originally a conservative Heritage Foundation plan previously implemented by former private equity executive Mitt Romney when he was the governor of Massachusetts. And even this market-friendly approach was later disavowed and attacked by Republicans. But despite these tremendous hurdles — or because of them — a clear public rage exists that would be foolish to ignore. For progressives seeking to reboot the Democratic Party, this is the time to turn public outrage at UnitedHealthcare into tangible pressure that breaks the back of business-as-usual. It is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. In evaluating the present moment, it is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. The hysterias over the so-called war on Christmas, transgender access to bathrooms, critical race theory, “all lives matter,” and “they’re eating the cats” are all examples of moments when conservatives have created controversies or flipped the script on real-world events to shift headlines and distract the public from the actual problems of concentrated power and wealth in America. Republicans have long been better at this than Democrats, because Republicans use their meme wars to punch down and target the powerless, while Democrats are usually too fearful to punch up and target the corporate elites who fund their campaigns while driving many of America’s ills. But unlike many Republican attacks, the problems with health insurance are real, and public concern is quite broad. A recent Economist/YouGov poll revealed that 62 percent of those polled blamed health insurance companies for problems with the health care system, and the same percentage blame corporate executives. Democrats would be foolish to let the public’s focus on UnitedHealthcare dissipate, but as the 2024 elections revealed, Democratic Party leaders have a long track record of such foolishness. Given that Republicans will soon hold a trifecta in Washington, and that many Democrats are too fearful of their paymasters to bluntly criticize the corporate classes, how can we push our political system to hold health insurers and Wall Street accountable? One answer might be found in abandoning any hope of seeking immediate redress through our legislative process. Instead we should treat health insurance companies, their dominant shareholders, and the politicians who serve them in the same way that one would treat a repressive government that one is trying to reform — or overthrow. In this context, our tools of battle become cultural delegitimization, demand radicalization, economic pressure, and (nonviolent) political war. Our goal should be to build an American political culture in which health insurance executives and their companies are viewed and treated the same way that child molesters and drug cartels are. They should be ostracized, stigmatized, and demonized. By doing so, we will shift American politics and create a more hospitable environment for pursuing the long-term accountability that health care reformers seek. This cultural delegitimization can be accomplished through a series of campaigns that target health insurance executives, demonize employment in their businesses, and create a broader negative environment in which no one wants to be associated with them. When it comes to finding opportunities to stigmatize these individuals and corporations, there are likely to be many opportunities to choose from. One recent example? Even as Thompson and UnitedHealthcare were denying sectors of the public access to valuable medical coverage, they were allowed to “sportswash” their reputations by serving as sponsors of the 2026 Special Olympics USA Games. The next time a philanthropic or community initiative unrolls a red carpet for a health insurance executive, there should be a dramatic public backlash. We must shift the Overton window far enough that legislative reforms and accountability become the moderate position in American politics. This means speaking bluntly and directly about what should happen to predatory health insurance executives, their corporations, and their enablers. Health insurance CEOs who implement denial of coverage practices to boost profits should go to jail. Health insurance companies that enable this behavior should face revocation of their corporate charters. And shareholders and investors who financially benefit from these ugly profits should be made directly and criminally liable. Finally, the thousands upon thousands of people who have been unjustly denied coverage for their medical services should be introduced to a new concept: reparations. Every entity that profits from predatory health insurance practices should be made to face economic costs. Corporate accountability campaigners and health insurance exchange experts should put their heads together to determine the best ways to undermine abusive health insurance companies’ access to new customers and policy holders. In addition, investors in UnitedHealth Group and other abusive health insurers should face direct pressure to divest from these companies. Investment funds, retirement funds, university endowments, and other major investment players should all be pushed to take their money elsewhere. As documented by Derek Seidman in Truthout, the top two shareholders of UnitedHealthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group “are the world’s two biggest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard,” which oversee a combined total of over $20 trillion in assets. Not only that, but BlackRock and Vanguard are also the top two shareholders of each of the top four U.S. health insurers. Both investment firms should face public demands to stop building their wealth off of the suffering of the thousands of people denied coverage for their medical needs. Finally, the days of prominent politicians taking money from UnitedHealth Group must come to an end. It’s not hard to imagine a large number of senior citizens signing on to a demand that politicians should not take money from health insurance companies that are denying older Americans health care coverage. With elections for the next Democratic National Committee chair coming up in February 2025, now is the time to push the DNC to stop taking money from UnitedHealth Group and other major health insurers. Politicians who stay silent on these demands and who refuse to bluntly criticize health insurance executives and companies should face electoral boycotts in which voters commit to voting against them. In a fairer world, Brian Thompson wouldn’t have been murdered. He would already have been put behind bars. Health insurance executives profiting off of human suffering should live in fear. But what they should fear is jail, not murder. We don’t want to live in a society where private individuals become judges, juries, and street executioners based simply on their own determinations of morality or crime. That is the world in which anti-abortion activists kill doctors and nurses. It is the world where white supremacist gunmen assume Black community members are “criminals” to be executed. In the space between illegal vigilante violence and deference to a broken political system is a vast opportunity for constructive and sustained political disruption that eliminates the “safe space” for business executives who profit from the destruction of human life. One can easily condemn the murder of Thompson while simultaneously condemning who Thompson was and what UnitedHealthcare is known to have done. Denying countless people access to the medical coverage they needed has caused significant pain and suffering, and may have even caused many unnecessary and early deaths. That it took a murder of a health insurance CEO for us to be talking about this reveals just how broken our political, legal, and media systems are. Health insurance executives, investors, and the politicians who they purchase should all fear social ostracism, financial collapse, and political defeat. This is entirely possible if the political rage of the American public is combined with a strategic road map that turns that anger into action. The fundamental question is whether or not progressive leaders and health care reformers have the courage to turn this moment into something of lasting significance.

IN LOCAL NEWS: • Controversial oil transport and storage company, Zenith Energy—you know, the one that could cause a Portland environmental catastrophe that could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster—was previously given the green light by the city to continue their clearly dangerous operations. But now? The DEQ has slammed the brakes on that process and is requiring the company to get a new air quality permit to remain in compliance with local agencies. This could afford the new, incoming city council and mayor time to put in place a new, stricter plan for Zenith—but will they? Our Taylor Griggs has the story. • Portland State University is currently struggling with what they say is a $18 million budget deficit, which is why they say they made the decision to lay off 17 non-tenure track faculty members. And while this is far less severe than their previous plan to lay off 94 workers, PSU's professors union is pointing to a financial report from an outside expert that reportedly shows that the university is in much better financial shape than they're letting on. Kevin Foster digs into the details in this interesting report. With an $18 million budget gap, Portland State University is cutting 17 academic staffers. That's less than what was anticipated in October, but PSU's professors union says an independent financial review shows stable reserves, and no need for layoffs. PSU says it's bound by accounting guidelines.⁠[image or embed] • Good news: Multnomah County's successful plan to help homeless Black people by sheltering them in a Portland motel just got a little better. The county has leased an even bigger motel—one with 65 rooms, and with a 10-year lease—in North Portland to house people of color, which will be run by the Urban League of Portland. For those naysayers who love to bitch and moan about the county at every possibility, you may want to take note of this stat: "In a one-year period from July 2023 to 2024, 55% of people exiting the shelter moved into permanent housing. Others moved into drug addiction treatment, behavioral health services or other medical programs. Only 3% returned to the street, officials said." That's progress, buddy. • More good news: The Community Cycling Center—the long running nonprofit that fixes and resells bikes to the community for cheap as well as offering bike education for kids—has found the funding it needs to stay afloat after being in danger of shutting down. When the center said it needed $349,000 to continue operating, the community was like, "We'll do you one better," and raised a whopping $389,000—$40 grand more—which will keep the good work flowing for the foreseeable future. Good work, Portlanders! 👏 Portland Thorns defender Becky Sauerbrunn, a three-time NWSL champion and a two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup winner, has announced her retirement.

The hornets, which are very large and are known for killing 42 people and seriously injuring 1,625 in China in 2013, had slowly been making their way across the US border—but were stopped thanks to the diligence of science and neighbors who put traps in their yards. That said, researchers are remaining vigilant to ensure the little stinging fuckers don't return. Looking for the perfect vinyl gifts for those music lovers and collectors in your life?

Musk tweeted over 100 times in a day in his attempt to sway congress (and their voters back home) to kill the deal, often spreading the type of bullshit misinformation that he and his fellow conspiracy theorists are so good at. Elon Musk’s congressional meddling had many Democrats referring to him as “President Musk” Wednesday—a jab sure to get under the notoriously spotlight-obsessed president-elect’s skin.[image or embed] • In another courtroom win for Trump, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis has been disqualified from the ex-and-future president's criminal racketeering case—which could stymie the state's chances for prosecution. Willis had been accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an attorney that was hired to lead the election interference case against Trump, and while one judge had initially allowed her to continue, that decision has been overturned. The only good news? Trump's indictment trial will continue despite the defense's best efforts to have the charges dismissed. • Union members at seven Amazon distribution centers across the US have walked off the job, after claiming that the company has refused to recognize their union and enter into bargaining. While the walkout is happening during the busy Christmas delivery season, Amazon officials contend deliveries will stay on time—though may be slowed a bit in major cities. • Luigi Mangione, the suspect/internet hero indicted in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is waiving extradition and will be traveling to New York City from Philadelphia where he will face murder and terrorism charges. Mangione's attorney expects the suspect to plead not guilty. what[image or embed] • In order to calm the panicking citizens of New Jersey, the FAA is declaring a temporary ban on all drone flights over the state, which have recently been freaking out citizens and wandering into military and commercial flight paths. [I will now translate this news blurb for the aliens who are waiting off New Jersey's shore, and planning their eventual attack and enslavement of the human race: "Bleep, bleep, blorp, bloop... bleep, BLEEP, bleep, blorp, bloop."] • And finally... while a "Santa vs. Grinch" movie currently doesn't exist, IT SHOULD, and this would be a fantastic trailer for it.

Title: Is it too late to buy bitcoin? Why some Wall Street experts say no — and 4 ways to start investing now.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-price-start-investing-wall-street-trump-2024-12

Full Content:
If you go by some of the many cautionary investing adages — like "buy low, sell high" or Warren Buffett's "be fearful when others are greedy" — it may be tough to argue that bitcoin is a good buy right now. The days when bitcoin traded at mere fractions of a cent are long gone. The cryptocurrency's price is anything but low, at least relative to what it was, especially after a 55% rally to over $108,000 following Donald Trump's reelection. But some market experts are taking the opposite philosophy with bitcoin and believe it's a fine time to buy, thanks to favorable fundamental trends. "We believe it is the period leading up to large-scale adoption where the biggest future return potential could lie," Samara Cohen, the chief investment officer of ETFs and index investments at BlackRock, wrote about bitcoin in a recent note. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth, shares this view. "We're basically in the beginning, even though $100,000 seems like a high number," he told BI. He recommends investors allocate about 1% to 10% of their portfolios to crypto, depending on risk tolerance. Cannon has seen inklings that other governments, such as Argentina, could adopt bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, sending the cryptocurrency's price even higher. "You want to get there before the big money is there," Cannon said. In other words, don't sit out on the bitcoin rally just because you think the ship has already sailed. Bill Miller IV, the chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Miller Value Funds, likens bitcoin to "digital gold" due to its scarce and decentralized nature. But the recent overwhelming interest in bitcoin is hardly a guarantee of its success. It's famously volatile and prone to dramatic price drops — hence why bitcoin bulls like BlackRock recommend exercising discretion and educating yourself on the risks when investing. But as institutional investors continue to pile in and talks about establishing a national bitcoin reserve swirl in Washington, it's increasingly apparent that the asset is being legitimized in the investing landscape. Luckily for investors, there's never been a more convenient time to be bitcoin-curious. As the cryptocurrency has gained steam in the past few years, mainstream brokerage firms have picked it up. You can purchase bitcoin directly through some online brokerages such as Fidelity, Robinhood, and Interactive Brokers. For those without $100,000 to drop on a bitcoin, these exchanges offer the opportunity to purchase fractional shares. However, others, like Charles Schwab and E-Trade, don't provide that option. If you want to hold bitcoin directly but can't buy it through your traditional brokerage account, fear not. There are several centralized crypto exchanges that provide a platform for buying and selling bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. Some bitcoin purists prefer buying on a decentralized exchange, similar to how some gold investors prefer buying bullion. "If you own bitcoin on a centralized entity, you force someone else to buy it on your behalf, but you don't actually hold the bitcoin," Miller said. Decentralized exchanges facilitate peer-to-peer trading without a broker, adding an extra layer of privacy and security. However, a decentralized exchange isn't the most beginner-friendly way to invest, as they have complex fee structures and don't permit exchanges between fiat and crypto. The first spot-bitcoin ETF debuted in the US in January 2024. A spot ETF provides investors with an accessible way of gaining exposure to bitcoin on a fully regulated traditional exchange. The funds hold bitcoins in a secure digital vault managed by registered custodians and issue shares to correspond with the number of bitcoins held. Bitcoin futures ETFs, which hold bitcoin futures contracts instead of actual bitcoins, are another investment vehicle. However, because they hold financial derivatives, these ETFs might not follow the price of bitcoin as closely as a spot ETF and can experience increased volatility due to the risks associated with futures contracts. Bitcoin ETFs are Cannon's go-to recommendation for new investors in the crypto space, as investors don't have to worry about directly holding bitcoin in a cryptocurrency wallet: "It's just like if they bought a stock," he said. He likes BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in particular. Other examples of bitcoin ETFs include the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Similar to how central banks stockpile gold, some of the market's biggest companies are building up their bitcoin reserves, even if their business operations have nothing to do with bitcoin. John Haar, the managing director of the bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, has seen investors increasing their bitcoin allocation indirectly by buying these companies' stocks. The business intelligence company Microstrategy (MSTR) is the most notable example in the market right now. Other companies adding bitcoin to their balance sheets include the biotech company Semler Scientific (SMLR) and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet (MTPLF), Haar said. Investors can also get bitcoin exposure by going straight to the source and buying stock in bitcoin-mining companies, Haar added. As a decentralized asset, bitcoin depends on a network of users to keep a record of transactions and verify new ones. Bitcoin miners use crypto software and hardware to solve complex puzzles and confirm the addition of blocks to the public ledger. Haar pointed to two examples: Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Mara Holdings (MARA). These companies operate data centers to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and provide auxiliary cryptocurrency services.

Title: Homelessness in NZ: The Christmas reality is there’s no room at the inn for Kiwis needing help

Rotorua homeless couple Elaine Sawyer and Anaru Hauiti have been sleeping rough this year. Photo / Andrew Warner THREE KEY FACTS Central to the Christmas message is that everyone needs a home – an article of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet as Christmas approaches this year, the coalition Government has announced that to meet their target for reducing Emergency Housing Special Needs Grants, the number of people in emergency housing will be reduced. Also, the availability of transitional housing will possibly be cut. It’s hard for anyone to know the number of people and families affected for sure, because they aren’t collected or reported. Moreover, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), which manages the public housing waiting list and the Emergency Housing Special Need Grants, are placing barriers in the way of those who are urgently seeking housing. There are credible reports that to verify applicants seeking housing because they are victims of domestic violence, staff at MSD Community are encouraged to phone the abusive partner to confirm that their partner did not contribute to the violence. Community advocates report that the criteria for state housing help are becoming less and less transparent and people are increasingly having to reapply. Community providers are increasingly having to turn away applicants, who are desperate for sustainable housing, but not counted in formal statistics as in need of housing. Meanwhile the Government does not have an alternative housing policy and keeps no record of housing need. There is no plan for providing alternative state or community housing elsewhere, at the scale required. Despite its record of significantly upscaling the building of high-quality housing in sustainable communities, Kāinga Ora - Homes and Communities has been denied any further capital funding. It has been directed not to do any further developments, and to restrict its scope to being a landlord only. To the dismay of community housing providers, Housing Minister Chris Bishop made it clear at the recent Community Housing Aotearoa Conference that the Government is not going to underwrite most community housing providers to build more community housing. Their capital in most cases will need to come from private equity, perhaps overseas investors like BlackRock, which has summarily liquidated SolarZero, despite receiving a large capital injection from Government. Frontline community staff are now increasingly having to help people – both adults and children – who are homeless and living in cars, or on the streets. Homeless numbers have increased, as the recently released Severe Housing Deprivation Study, based on the 2023 Census, showed. By contrast, in a recent evaluation of The Housing First policy, it was shown to be the most effective way to help people back into stable housing. It enables them to re-enter employment, and for their children to be registered with a GP and immunised, prosper at school, keep well, and turn up less frequently at accident and emergency departments. Most dispiritingly, we have seen this cycle before: we know what the outcomes will be. When Sir Bill English was the Minister for Housing New Zealand Corporation, the precursor of Kāinga Ora from 2014-2016, he called himself “the largest slum landlord in New Zealand”. Between 2013/14 and 2016/17 the Minister began the sale of state housing, which led to about a 5000 fall in the number of state houses, without any serious consideration of the consequences. Unsurprisingly, this led to a major increase in homelessness. He established Emergency Housing, which mainly used temporary accommodation to house the growing numbers of people left homeless as a direct result of the lack of new public houses. For all too many people — children, adults, single people and families — this Christmas there is still “no room at the inn”. Police described it as a family harm incident.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Micron stock (MU) plummeted more than 16% Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter despite burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence chips. The memory chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) as a major customer, said Wednesday it expects revenue between $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to guide for revenue of $9 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Micron’s outlook points to a trend across the chip industry: Sales of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence are growing quickly, while traditional chip sales slump. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units), which hyperscalers use in data centers to power both their customers' and their own artificial intelligence workloads. Blackwell demand is expected to soar in the upcoming year. CEO of Micron Technology Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement Wednesday that data center revenue, which includes Micron's memory chips used in GPUs, grew to more than 50% of the company's total revenue for the first time in its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 28. Meanwhile, its “consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term." For example, Micron said that while its HBM chips revenue rose more than 50% in the November quarter, revenue from its chips for mobile phones fell 19%. Mehrotra said Micron is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy following its earnings results and outlook. Arya said Micron's growing revenue from sales of its memory chips for AI isn't enough to offset pressures from weak demand for those used in personal computers and smartphones. Analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan, Raymond James, and TD Cowen, also lowered their price targets on the stock but kept their Buy ratings. While Micron said weak demand in the PC market is taking longer than expected to pick up, it pointed to a surging AI market opportunity for its HBM semiconductors used in AI chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Micron said it projects the market for HBM to grow to $30 billion in 2025, up from its prior forecast of $25 billion. The chipmaker sees its own HBM revenue soaring from several hundred million dollars in its fiscal year 2024 to multiple billions of dollars in 2025. “Perhaps what was most surprising is not MU's guidance, but the stock reaction AH [after the market close] given the well-understood weakness in near-term memory pricing,” TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note Thursday. Sankar reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $135. Micron shares stood at $87 at the market close Thursday. For its fiscal first quarter, Micron's earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the expected $1.76, while its revenue of $8.7 billion was in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

The Dow staged a rebound Thursday morning, following Wednesday’s 1,100-point plunge that marked its longest losing streak since 1974. The upturn came despite investor disappointment over the Federal Reserve’s conservative approach to rate cuts. Other major indices, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, also experienced gains after a sell-off on Wednesday afternoon. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 194 points or 0.4%.

Title: NVIDIA Asks Super Micro Computer (SMCI) To Investigate How Its Chips Were Illicitly Procured By China, Including The Issue Of Forged Server Serial Numbers

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We reported a few months back how NVIDIA's H100 GPUs, which remain under a strict US export control regime in relation to China, were readily accessible via Super Micro Computer's dealers within the Asian giant. Well, this issue has finally caught the attention of the authorities in the US. U.S. PROBES $NVDA CHIP SMUGGLING TO CHINA: INFORMATION The Commerce Dept has asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips ended up in China despite export restrictions, per The Information. NVIDIA instructed major distributors, including Supermicro and Dell, to conduct spot checks… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 19, 2024 To wit, The Information is now reporting that the US Commerce Department has formally asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips that remain subject to export controls were ending up in China. For its part, NVIDIA has asked its major distributors, including Super Micro Computer and Dell, to conduct spot checks on their regional customers. NVIDIA is particularly concerned as to how some of the end-users in China were purportedly able to forge server serial numbers to circumvent the restrictions imposed under the prevailing US export controls. Back in April, our own search on Baidu had yielded a number of posts, including one which promised a large shipment of NVIDIA's H100 chips "arriving in Hong Kong in two weeks, and can be picked up in Shenzhen or Zhengzhou." Some of the posts also included data sheets bearing Super Micro Computer's logo. Similarly, a post on ZOL at the time also referenced a promotion of H100 chips from Super Micro Computer. The listing on Zol is still easily accessible but whether the GPUs are with the poster cannot be verified. Of course, this development comes as the relation between NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer appear somewhat strained. Digi Times reported back in November that NVIDIA was redirecting some of its orders that were originally placed with SMCI to other suppliers. Similarly, during Super Micro Computer's Q1'25 earnings call, when asked by an analyst as to when Blackwell revenues would start showing up in SMCI's books, the company's CEO Charles Liang had bemoaned that "we are asking NVIDIA every day [for those chips]." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Hindenburg Research had leveled damning allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, detailing a litany of malpractices at the firm. Those allegations had then prompted the firm to delay the filing of its annual report for FY 2024 and the quarterly financial statements for Q1 2025. The Nasdaq exchange then concluded that this inordinate delay was inconsistent with its listing requirements. However, on the 06th of December, Nasdaq accepted Super Micro Computer's plan to regain compliance with the exchange's listing requirements, and granted a reprieve until the 25th of February 2025. Meanwhile, SMCI's relentless share price plunge has been sufficient to push the stock out of the Nasdaq 100 index. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

By Peter White Executive Editor, Television It’s been a weird year for the unscripted television business. Networks and streamers have been greenlighting fewer shows and producers are struggling, with numerous mid-size companies closing and layoffs across the sector and global outsourcing and budget issues becoming major talking points with the reality industry. Travis Kelce became a game show host, Alec Baldwin started filming a TLC reality series and Colin Jost is hosting a Jeopardy! spinoff. Blake Shelton and Taylor Sheridan have a new singing competition at CBS, which also is developing a new cooking show with Padma Lakshmi. Hulu breathed new life into reality with Mormon wives, Netflix is going full Willy Wonka, American Gladiators is returning, shows like The Traitors and The Floor are being renewed at quite the clip, and Meghan Markle still is getting attention at Netflix. Watch on Deadline RELATED: Renewed TV Series 2024: A Photo Gallery There were some interesting business models being explored including NBC’s international push with Destination X, Fox taking second windows for Amazon game shows and The CW making low-cost board game adaptations. But there were plenty of shows coming to an end including a swath of Nat Geo titles including Wicked Tuna, Hulu’s The D’Amelio Show and ABC’s Lucky 13. Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules is looking for an entirely new cast. RELATED: 2024 TV Series Cancellations & Renewals There were also a lot of layoffs affecting unscripted execs at Netflix, Lionsgate, The CW, Lifetime, A&E, ABC and Amazon as well as high-profile departures at American Idol and America’s Got Talent, the exit of CBS’ Jack Sussman and the retirement of Warner Bros. Discovery’s Kathleen Finch. On a more positive note, Jeff Gaspin took over reality programming at Netflix. On a corporate level, Amazon looked to sell its unscripted production companies, Fulwell 73 is merging with Lebron James’ Springhill, All3Media completed its takeover by RedBird IMI but closed Maverick TV USA, Asylum Entertainment started investing in companies like Done+Dusted after receiving cash from Endeavor, Wheelhouse scored money from Jeff Bewkes and Kevin Tsujihara and Chick-Fil-A started a streaming service with reality ambitions. RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs So Far In 2024: From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN All well and good, but what’s next year going to look like? Deadline spoke with to close to 50 unscripted producers about their hopes and dreams for 2025. INVESTMENT IN LIVE PROGRAMMING More live event programming. This year we saw so many watercooler moments with The Roast of Tom Brady, Dancing with the Stars going viral with the TikTok generation and the Tyson-Paul fight. That nostalgic feeling of bringing everyone together for a shared cultural experience is important no matter what format or platform people are watching.Rob Mills, EVP Unscripted and Alternative Entertainment, Walt Disney Television (Hulu’s It’s All Country) RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming It’s clear platforms and networks know the value of live programming, but we’d love to see more investment in live content across genres, outside the worlds of sports and comedy. We’ve seen how great live shows can revive event programming, and more innovation in this space from producers and more backing from buyers could be a boon for unscripted.Lucilla D’Agostino, Head, Big Fish Entertainment & Evolution Media (Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules) INTRODUCE UNSCRIPTED TAX INCENTIVES IN CALIFORNIA We hope to see a renewed focus on innovation within the unscripted television industry in 2025, driven by three key changes. First, adopting fresh approaches to bring more original commissions to life, especially bold new American formats that push the boundaries. Second, meaningful subsidies in New York and Los Angeles — the two most important production hubs in the U.S. — are essential to ensuring the longevity of these cities, which are losing productions to cost-cutting pressures. Finally, a stronger commitment to sharing upside will inspire top talent across all disciplines of production to give their best, knowing their efforts are meaningfully rewarded in success.Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman, Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Television – Nonfiction (ABC’s Shark Tank) I think we are all eagerly hoping for a substantial California Film and Television Tax Credit to be approved in 2025. The unscripted industry could greatly benefit from a portion of that funding to incentivize companies to shoot in L.A. We have an abundance of exceptional above- and below-the-line talent right here, but many are being forced to leave their homes and families for extended periods to earn a living in other states or countries. Let’s keep our industry thriving locally. Come on, Gavin — make it happen! And … ad-funded content has enormous untapped potential to address some of the industry’s toughest challenges for both producers and networks. While there seems to be a growing appetite for it, there hasn’t been much to show for it yet. There are more conversations happening in this space than ever, and I’m hopeful we’ll see more of it come to fruition in 2025. Fewer episodes per season have also become a real challenge — especially for shows with tighter budgets — and small episode orders make it hard for production companies to stay profitable and limit opportunities to tell great stories. Larger episode orders would not only stabilize businesses but also unlock better economies of scale. More episodes equals better stories plus healthier businesses. DEI feels like it’s slipping away, but letting it die is bad business. We’ve got a deep pool of talent, behind the camera and on-screen, that deserves a fair shot. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion isn’t just about doing good; it’s good for the bottom line. Don’t pull the plug in 2025.Jennifer O’Connell and Rebecca Quinn, Co-CEOs, Velvet Hammer Media (The CW’s The Big Bakeover) If Gavin Newsom were to give tax incentives to at least unscripted union series, it would be a significant step toward bringing production back to Hollywood. Without such incentives, achieving a lower price point for these shows becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible.Jenny Daly, President, Critical Content (Netflix’s Sly) We strongly encourage tax incentives for filming unscripted content in Los Angeles. These shows are only as good as the individuals who produce them, and while B17 has tapped into an incredibly talented Canadian community of late, we would also love to utilize the brilliant minds here in L.A. who have contributed to our success over the past decade but currently face limited opportunities.Rhett Bachner and Brien Meagher, Founders, B17 Entertainment (Netflix’s History of Swear Words) TAKE BIGGER RISKS, BUY BOLDER IDEAS It would be wonderful if buyers were more willing to invest in unscripted ideas that have never been done before. At ESNA, we’re fortunate to have access to a wealth of fabulous IP across Banijay, and we thrive on innovating and reimagining concepts to find the “why now.” But when we look at the most daring scripted hits, they are almost always true original ideas. As we move into 2025, my hope for unscripted content is that when a truly great idea excites a buyer, they get to place a bet on it and make something that has never been done before.Sharon Levy, CEO, Endemol Shine North America (Fox’s MasterChef) In 2025, we’d like to see the unscripted community champion more bold and original concepts. While spinoffs and reboots have a valuable place, we’d like to experience a renewed focus on fresh ideas driven by creative risk-taking. By aiming to deliver content that feels genuinely new and exciting, we can meaningfully push the unscripted space forward for audiences and our creative partners. Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks, SVP Development Warner Horizon/Telepictures (ABC’s The Bachelor) We are optimistic about 2025 because there seems to be a real appetite in the global market for big ideas and a growing willingness to partner and collaborate on creating and launching them. We are excited about the new opportunities ahead with the new business models emerging.Allison Wallach, Head of Unscripted Entertainment, Fox Entertainment Studios (Fox’s The Masked Singer) I’m optimistic that 2025 will be the year of risk: buyers taking risks to commission the big, loud ideas they say they want; producers leaving their comfort zones to pull them off; and the industry at large taking a risk on figuring out a way to utilize the incredible talent pool in our country.Karrie Wolfe, Co-Head of Development, North Road’s Kinetic Content (Netflix’s Love Is Blind) The recognition that all our creative futures thrive with a little bit of risk. Great content and breakout formats don’t always get born from deep within a corporate machine that houses 130 labels with footprints in 26 countries. Some of the world’s greatest unscripted formats were created with a spark by a wipe board, pitched with an in-person run-through and then sold to executives and commissioners that were given the freedom and motivation themselves to take the occasional risk. Robin Ashbrook, Founder, theoldschool (Netflix’s Next in Fashion) The single best thing that could happen would be a huge hit show that was sold off paper, without tape, existing IP or big star names and unaltered by data or focus groups. A show that a network just flat-out believed in and took a punt on. Taking risks has never been harder, but it’s the only way to create something special. To get the industry’s courage back, we all need someone to trust their instincts on a totally fresh idea and, critically, turn out to be absolutely right.Glenn Hugill, Chief Content Officer, Wheelhouse (Netflix’s Buying Beverly Hills) I’d love to see the unscripted TV community take braver risks in 2025. Reviving classics will always have its place, but the real future is in creating fresh ideas that connect with audiences now and could become the iconic formats of tomorrow. At Eureka, we’re focused on pushing boundaries with new concepts, and if we all lean into more creativity and bold thinking, 2025 could be truly transformational for the industry.Chris Culvenor, Co-CEO, Eureka Productions (Netflix’s The Mole) For 2025’s unscripted genie, I have three wishes. Firstly, for networks, cablers and streamers to re-allocate budget for unscripted. Secondly, a commitment to developing brand-new and original competition, dating and social experiment formats; we need to keep unscripted audiences engaged. Finally, more! More budget, more commissions, more work for talented unscripted execs, creators, producers, crew and post staff.Julie Pizzi, CEO, Bunim/Murray Productions (MTV’s The Challenge) The unscripted industry was born from creative mavericks who challenged conventions and redefined what television could be. In 2025, I’d like to see us all lean further into that legacy — embracing bold, untested ideas and reigniting the magic that sparked this industry.Matt Sharp, CEO, Sharp Entertainment (TLC’s 90 Day Fiancé) I’d love to lose the word “unscripted” completely and tighten the community here in L.A. In many ways, producers who have been labeled as “unscripted” get the worst of all worlds, quickly relegated to either what’s considered perishable reality volume or precious documentary with a message. But the truth is we are creators, writers, directors, DPs, editors and the nimble problem solvers who work with every storytelling tool imaginable. What I mean is, we are the adaptable ones, the survival of the fittest. We are the ones who can do a lot with a little and we are the ones who should be leading the charge into the great unknown regardless of genre, bucket or past (habitual) Hollywood stigma. We will roll up our sleeves and get it done, so let’s embrace that and redraw the boundaries where creatives can retake control by doing and risk taking. Isn’t that how this business was built?Ari Mark, Co-Founder, Ample Entertainment (Netflix’s This is The Zodiac Speaking) Everyone knows the past few years have been challenging for everyone in the unscripted business — on both sides of the buyer/seller line. My greatest wish for 2025 is for decision-makers to take more strategic chances on new content. Embrace original ideas from creative thinkers who understand how to deliver a big content bang for smart bucks. We all understand that pre-existing IP can be a good choice, and it often works, but the biggest breakthroughs that boosted the bottom line for brands across the past decade have been fresh, risky, exciting new swings. Even in times of significant uncertainty, intelligent risks can be transformative.Gena McCarthy, Unconventional Entertainment (Hallmark+’s Celebrations with Lacey Chabert) One thing I hope will change in 2025 is the downward pressure on budgets, especially as viewership and cultural significance of unscripted projects are at an all-time high on many platforms.Ross Dinerstein, CEO, Campfire Studios (Netflix’s The Menendez Brothers) The game and competition format has been one of the strongest genres ever since it helped launch television in its infancy. Recently, we’ve seen our industry embrace this time-tested formula on both broadcast and streaming platforms. We’re excited for this genre to be revitalized. Gabriel Marano, Head of Television, Hasbro Entertainment (The CW’s Scrabble) Next year I’d love to see unscripted television fully embrace interactive content, such as choose-your-own-adventure formats and augmented reality experiences. These innovations would empower audiences to engage with shows in exciting new ways, creating a more immersive and personal connection. Additionally, I hope to see the continued expansion of successful franchise formats globally, as they provide a unique opportunity to bring diverse stories and perspectives to screens worldwide.Lashan Browning, Founder and CEO, Antoinette Media (MTV’s Love & Hip Hop) In 2025, I’d love to see the unscripted television community fully embrace bold storytelling, artistry and revelatory work that challenges long-held narratives. By championing untold stories from underrepresented voices and speaking truth to power, we have an unparalleled opportunity to engage audiences, spark essential conversations and inspire cultural change. Our industry thrives when we take creative risks, and I hope 2025 is the year we lean into this potential more than ever.Mary Robertson, Maxine Productions (ID’s Quiet On Set) I would like to see more buyers trusting their instincts to greenlight series and renewals. Instead, decisions rest in the hands of giant committees spanning a dozen departments and focus groups largely comprised of people paid $50 for the day to determine the fate of our industry. Leaders like Nancy Dubuc and Eileen O’Neill considered all of that but ultimately relied on their own instincts. They championed series that became hits by stepping outside the safety net of “research.” I miss those days because many hits were born from that decision-making process. The industry is filled with talented high-level executives – let’s empower them to say yes instead of scaring them into saying no.Steve Michaels, CEO, Asylum Entertainment Group (Discovery+’s Hillsong) With networks and platforms prioritizing those “undeniable’ shows” – the slam-dunks – it would be great to see more space for three-pointers: big, fun ideas that might be a bit riskier and more surprising but also offer more upside.Steven Weinstock and Glenda Hersh, Co-CEOs, Truly Original (Bravo’s Summer House) We’d like to see the industry take bigger risks (again) and embrace bolder, more original creative. We want to surprise audiences when they show up, regardless of platform. Fearlessness in finding and lighting up universes and talent defined unscripted for a long time and getting back to that would be a win for the business in every way.Matt Ostrom, Co-Founder, Magilla Entertainment (Discovery’s Moonshiners) The healthiest thing about the unscripted business right now is its embrace of big stories. Making sure that we all also look out for the smaller, lesser-known stories that can have just as big an impact on audiences will keep all of our work fresh, exciting and, best of all, unexpected.Aaron Cohen, Chief Creative Officer, Words + Pictures (HBO’s Murder in Boston) In our current market, some buyers have been more reliant on existing formats and older established IP. While we do benefit from some of this ourselves and understand its value and importance, I would love to see more of a willingness from networks/streamers to make more room for new riskier concepts, as it’s the only way to launch and discover new hits. Sandy Varo Jarrell, CEO, Bright Spot Content (Discovery’s Puppy Bowl) As storytellers, we’ll always bet on ourselves. But at some point, you just can’t do more with less money. Perhaps it’s time for networks to reimagine the traditional commission structure and embrace working with producers and talent to invent unique ways to fund and create content. And let’s take some risks! What we have been doing is not working, so why not be bold and try a new approach? Our greatest successes this year have been when our partners let us take some rights, shared revenue streams and allowed us to be more creatively nimble. Patrick Weiland, President, Intuitive Content (PBS’ Hope in the Water) We hope that in 2025, there is an even bigger and broader appetite across all networks and streamers for unscripted content, because nothing compares to compelling and authentic storytelling through real-life experiences.Eric and Shannon Evangelista, Co-Founders, Hot Snakes Media (ID’s The Curious Case of Natalia Grace) I’d like to see the business shift away from inflated development requests and instead put more trust in proven producers to deliver on great creative ideas. A more direct and efficient approach to proving a concept, on both sides — producer and buyer — could yield such tremendous results for the production community and bring about more opportunities for partnerships to flourish.Jessica Sebastian-Dayeh, President, Maven (Roku’s The Marriage Pact) Return to creativity. I would urge buyers to trust their most creative executives and lean away from relying so heavily on research during the greenlight process. Data and research provide insights into the past, they cannot predict the future. A talented producer with a creative mind will find your next big hit. Fourteen years ago, when I sold Dance Moms — a franchise soon to reach 300 episodes and counting — it wasn’t on anyone’s needs list. No one was looking for that kind of show. It took a network executive with gut instinct and a willingness to take a risk to roll the dice. Today, many of the most talked-about series come from abroad, where risk-taking and creativity are more prominent. We have some of the most talented producers in the history of unscripted television walking among us. There’s never been a better time to let them shine.Jeff Collins, Resilient Content In 2025, I’d like to see less fear in the marketplace and a return to buyers taking bold risks instead of betting solely on sure things. Many of the beloved franchises we enjoy today were born from networks taking unexpected swings, and our industry needs to embrace that spirit again to foster innovation and create a new generation of hit shows. This also means giving shows the time and space to grow — believing in the potential of talent or ideas to develop over time. We need to move away from the mindset that a show’s success is determined by its first outing. In today’s world of fragmented audiences, building loyalty and viewership over time is more critical than ever.Nick Rigg, Brass Monkeys Media PARTNERSHIPS, RIGHTS & COMMUNITY I like to think of the unscripted industry as a team sport. There are a lot of players who have key roles in creating a show, all with the same goal. In 2025, I’d like to see the industry and all its players working together and winning together as a community. By breaking the mold and finding new and creative ways to collaborate, we’ll not only survive until ’25, we’ll thrive.Toby Gorman, President, Universal Television Alternative Studio (NBC’s That’s My Jam) The recent shift in the market I believe has brought many in the unscripted community closer together than ever. Both network buyers and producers are feeling the effects, which I hope sparks a deeper sense of partnership and solidarity between both sides on every collaboration.Jimmy Fox, EVP Unscripted Development and Sales, Fremantle (ABC’s American Idol) I think what we all want is to see everyone back to work. Any innovative business models, partnerships or incentives that help keep productions Stateside would bring a significant lift to the industry.Adam Sher, President, ITV America (Peacock’s Love Island) This is not the first time co-productions have been on the table for networks in the U.S. – quite the contrary. Once upon a time, each U.S. linear network had dedicated executives with the word “co-production” in their title. They would go out to market and find a distributor willing to come in to help close financing. I don’t know how much of that is happening, but the producers need the networks to be more willing to open this back up in a real way. For their own survival, U.S. linear networks should build relationships with networks internationally to be able to make quick calls to trust partners and say, “Hey, do you want it? We love this but need $50,000 an ep to close financing.” I know that U.S. network-to-international network conversations are happening on a very small level, but they need to expand those conversations. The networks are relying on the producers and distributors to go out and find the money, but all options need to be on the table in the market — all hands on deck. JC Mills, President and Head of Content, Cineflix (History’s American Pickers) We as nonfiction professionals have always been a resourceful and resilient group, and I’m hoping 2025 is when we can put that mindset even more into action. I think the sooner we accept that the market is the market, the sooner we can see the opportunities that exist for us to thrive in this new landscape. The opportunities may not be in the places we’ve experienced them in the past, but there are opportunities in new places, genres and strategies that can position our industry for continued success. In the early 2000s, unscripted was thought of by many in the scripted world as cheap, filler programming. We turned that around then, and we can do that again as we work with our distribution partners to build a new nonfiction marketplace. But it’s up to us to open our creative aperture and find those new genres and platforms to keep our audiences engaged in nonfiction storytelling.Jeff Hasler, President, Original Productions (Discovery’s Deadliest Catch) More buyers who recognize the extraordinary opportunity and value offered by nonfiction programming. Drive the culture. Be a part of the conversation. Win big awards. Make your subscribers even happier. Nonfiction offers it all.R.J. Cutler, Founder, This Machine (Netflix’s Martha) The heart of unscripted will always be the people. In 2025, I would love to come back to that guiding light and see all of us in the community, networks and producers taking more chances to let the casts and stories develop organically. Our industry will thrive as long as we continue to support these bold personalities who we all love.Carlos King, CEO, Kingdom Reign Entertainment (OWN’s Belle Collective) 2024 was truly a rough year for our industry, both scripted and unscripted. There were fewer pickups, more layoffs, tight budgets, high expectations and a general sense of dread that consumed what had been a thriving community of entertainment creatives. As we look toward 2025, we should do so with hope, as well as a realistic sense of expectations. My dream for 2025 is to lock arms with our network partners to create fresh, innovative content that will reinvigorate their audience’s decades-long passion for unscripted storytelling.Rob Eric, Chief Content Officer, Scout Productions (Netflix’s Queer Eye) Treat production companies as partners, not vendors, and the relationship will thrive. The industry has been weighed down by hesitation and fear, with too much posturing born from anxiety. It’s time to take bold risks and move faster. That’s what will inject new life into the business. Accelerate renewals, reduce development limbo and stand out in a crowded marketplace. Let’s prioritize real action and restore a higher standard of professionalism and ethical business practices. The industry cannot move forward by standing still. It’s time to take decisive steps and create real momentum.David Brady, CEO, Cream Productions (Netflix’s Age of Samurai) We’d love to see the industry embrace a more fluid rights universe and have more open and serious conversations about substantial U.S. licensing deals that allow producers to pursue international and other future sales. This could be an incredibly effective solution to the challenges that both buyers and sellers are facing, and while we’ve already begun to see the pendulum swing in this direction, it would be great to see those discussions and deals become more widespread in 2025.Greg Henry and Kim Woodard, Co-Presidents, Lucky 8 (Netflix’s Unlocked) Let’s have some fun in 2025 and appreciate how fortunate are we to get paid to entertain folks. So let’s stop obsessing about staying alive to ‘25 and focus instead on the creative opportunities that change generates. Because we at Plimsoll love TV, we categorically refuse to spend the next 12 months feeling downcast about the state of the industry.

Spending on hospital care increased, as well. The UnitedHealthcare shooting is also in the news. MedPage Today: Health Spending Up 7.5% In 2023, CMS Says Health spending in the U.S. rose by 7.5% in 2023, to $4.9 trillion, compared with an increase of 4.6% in 2022, according to figures released Wednesday by CMS. "Much of the growth came from faster growth and spending [by] private health insurance, which increased 11.5%, and Medicare, which increased 8.1%," Anne Martin, of the CMS Office of the Actuary, said during a briefing sponsored by Health Affairs. "For Medicaid, although spending and enrollment continue to increase, the rates of growth were lower in 2023 compared with 2022 -- Medicaid spending grew by 7.9% in 2023 compared with 9.7% growth in 2022."

The New York Times: Trump, Egged On By Musk, Condemns Spending Deal, Raising Fears Of Government Shutdown A bipartisan spending deal to avert a shutdown was on life support on Wednesday after President-elect Donald J. Trump condemned it, leaving lawmakers without a strategy to fund the government past a Friday night deadline. Mr. Trump issued a scathing statement ordering Republicans not to support the sprawling bill, piling on to a barrage of criticism from Elon Musk, who spent Wednesday trashing the measure on social media and threatening any Republican who supported it with political ruin. (Edmondson and Hulse, 12/18) The Hill: Johnson Considers Plan B Amid Trump World Opposition To Spending Deal Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is looking at a plan B to fund the government ahead of Friday’s shutdown deadline as Republicans inside and outside the Capitol, including President-elect Trump and his allies, slam his spending package. The back-up option Johnson is examining is a “clean” continuing resolution, two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill. That would entail dropping the additional provisions that were included in the initial 1,500-page spending package negotiated by congressional leaders, including disaster aid and economic assistance for farmers. (Schnell, 12/18) The New York Times: What’s Inside The Spending Bill To Avoid A Government Shutdown? The stopgap spending bill congressional leaders agreed on this week began as a simple funding measure to keep government funds flowing past a Friday night deadline and into early next year, long after House Republicans elect a speaker and President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in. But by the time it was rolled out to lawmakers on Tuesday night, it had transformed into a true Christmas tree of a bill, adorned with all manner of unrelated policy measures in the kind of year-end catchall that Republicans have long derided. It is a 1,547-page behemoth of a package with provisions including foreign investment restrictions, new health care policies and a stadium site for the Washington Commanders. (Edmondson, 12/18) Also — The Washington Post: Senate Passes Pentagon NDAA That Set Off Transgender-Care Debate The Senate on Wednesday passed an $895.2 billion defense policy bill that sparked controversy when House Speaker Mike Johnson amended the legislation with language forbidding the use of federal funds to cover specialized medical care for the transgender children of U.S. military personnel. Though several Senate Democrats protested Johnson’s 11th-hour maneuver, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was approved 85-14 — a comfortable margin that belied the depth of frustration among lawmakers who said the legislation, as written, discriminates against thousands of military families and their right to health care. The bill heads next to the president, who is expected to sign it into law. Several senior Democratic senators said that while they shared their colleagues’ frustration with the transgender-care provision, the NDAA was too important to fail.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Commerce has recently asked Nvidia to look into how the company's products ended up in China over the past year, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person close to the department. The chip giant has asked big distributors such as Super Micro Computer and Dell Technologies to conduct spot checks of their customers in Southeast Asia, the report said. Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips are embedded in server products made by Super Micro and Dell. The Information reported that five different people involved in smuggling Nvidia chips said they have managed so far to evade detection during recent inspections by Super Micro. "We insist that our customers and partners strictly adhere to all export control restrictions. Any unauthorized deviation of previously-owned products, including any grey market resales, would be a burden on our business, not a benefit," an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed response. Some of the customers duplicated serial numbers of the servers containing Nvidia chips that they purchased from Super Micro and attached them to other servers that they had access to, the report said, citing a person close to Super Micro. In some cases, smugglers even altered the serial numbers in the operating system for the servers, the report said. Dell said the company requires its distributors and resellers to follow all applicable regulations and export controls. The company added that it takes appropriate action "up to and including termination" of its relationship if a partner is not adhering to these obligations. Super Micro said it investigates and takes action against any unauthorized exports or re-exports of its products by third parties. "Supermicro follows all U.S. export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses under the Export Administration Regulations," the company told Reuters. The commerce department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Joe Biden administration has doubled down on its chip crackdown in China. The U.S. broadened a ban on the sale of high-end AI chips to the country last year. Still, several Chinese universities and research institutes procured these Nvidia chips via resellers, a Reuters review of tender documents showed earlier in 2024. Earlier this month, the U.S. curbed semiconductor exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers.

Title: Nvidia stock rebounds after broad market rout as analysts stay bullish on outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: What's New With Mastercard Stock?

POLAND - 2024/11/17: In this photo illustration, the Mastercard company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Mastercard’s stock (NYSE: MA) is up approximately 25% year-to-date compared to the 27% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. In comparison, Mastercard’s peer Visa (NYSE: V) has returned about 22%. So what are some of the factors driving Mastercard stock higher? The company outperformed the street estimates in the third quarter of FY 2024. It reported net revenues of $7.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Several factors are driving growth for the company. For one, cross-border volumes rose 17% year-over-year led by higher international travel as well as e-commerce growth. Gross dollar volumes were also up 10%, while the number of switched transactions was up 11%. Switched transactions refer to the transactions processed via the Mastercard platform. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Further, revenues from value-added services and solutions grew 18% in the quarter driven by higher demand for the company’s consulting and marketing services as well as the scaling of its fraud and security and identity and authentication solutions. Adjusted net income was up by about 12% compared to last year to $3.6 billion, growing slightly slower than revenues due to higher general and administrative expenses. As an aside, check out Buy, Sell, Or Hold Alaska Air Stock? The increase in MA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 1% in 2021, -3% in 2022, and 23% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what’s the outlook like for MA stock? There are a couple of trends that could drive MA stock going forward. The Fed’s recent interest rate cuts could help reduce borrowing costs and potentially drive spending on credit cards, directly benefiting Mastercard’s transaction volumes and fee revenues. Moreover, Mastercard’s investments into expanding in emerging markets, including regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Africa could give the company more scope for growth given its highly recognizable brand and the increasing push toward digital and cashless transactions. Mastercard has been doubling down on its shareholder returns. The company’s board recently approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the company to buy back up to $12 billion in stock. The company also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.76 compared to its previous dividend of $0.66. We value Mastercard stock at about $518 per share, which is roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Mastercard’s valuation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday finalized an award to SK Hynix of up to $458 million in government grants to help fund an advanced chip packaging plant and research and development facility for artificial intelligence products in Indiana. In April, the Nvidia supplier said it would invest $3.87 billion to build the West Lafayette facility which will include an assembly line to mass produce next-generation high bandwidth memory chips. The chips are used in graphic processing units that train artificial intelligence systems. The department also plans to make available $500 million in government loans for the SK Hynix project. The grant funds would be distributed when SK Hynix meets project milestones. The project will create 1,000 jobs and fill a key gap in the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, the department said. Kwak Noh-Jung, CEO of the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said in a statement the company looks forward to working "to build a robust and resilient AI semiconductor supply chain in the U.S." Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority. The Commerce Department is awarding major grants to all five leading semiconductor manufacturers - TSMC, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Micron and SK Hynix. The department has now finalized all of those but the $6.4 billion Samsung award. This month it finalized a $75 million award to Absolics for constructing a facility in Georgia to supply advanced materials to the country's semiconductor industry. Absolics is an affiliate of SKC, which in turn is part of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate SK Group, as is SK Hynix.

Full Content:
Hello there! With the holiday season upon us, it seems the Christmas spirit is spreading, and the idea of goodwill is more prominent than ever. Let me begin with an event that took place yesterday at the Ministry of National Defense. Thanasis Laskaridis and his family laid the foundation for the new building of the Special Cyber Unit of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA), which will be constructed thanks to a donation by the “Athanasios C. Laskaridis Foundation,” named after him. The modest ceremony was attended by Minister Nikos Dendias, Deputy Minister Yiannis Kefalogiannis, the host, GEETHA Chief General Dimitris Choupis, and a select few distinguished guests, including U.S. Ambassador George Tsounis and Chania MP Sevi Voloudaki. Minister Dendias expressed his gratitude for the donation, noting that last year, donations to the Ministry of Defense amounted to €234,000, while this year they soared to €26 million. Interesting, right? But even more striking was the closing remark of the donor, Thanasis Laskaridis, which I’ll quote verbatim: “After all, as the popular song says, dedicated to poor Loukas, we won’t take a single penny to the grave. It’s good, then, for those whom God has blessed with some surplus to do something to help our homeland. It’s time for all of us to get rid of the ‘crabs in our pockets’ and do whatever we can, whatever is necessary.” Dendias’ Commentary and Military Camp Rumors During the same event, Dendias couldn’t avoid questions from those present about the well-known issue (regarding the President of the Republic), jokingly responding, “Well, I’m probably the last person who could comment on this matter,” which, of course, has been settled for a while now—if it was ever truly open. On the other hand, the Minister was much more talkative about efforts to modernize military camps, making sure to throw in a jab about the sparse rumors suggesting that the areas formerly used as camps will be turned into business ventures. “When someone wants to slander another person or initiative, they immediately turn it into a story about interests and that’s the end of it,” he remarked. The Registrar’s Anxiety (Which Has Ended) Over Pavlos Possibly today—or at the latest tomorrow—the former royal family will take action regarding their citizenship. Whether their lawyer will show up, as happened with Michel de Grèce, or Pavlos himself will make an appearance, I can’t say for sure. However, what I can say is that yesterday at the Athens Registry Office, there was quite a commotion, with phones ringing off the hook as employees scrambled to handle all the technical details of the forthcoming request. This was complicated by the fact that certain procedures have been digitized since the Venizelos law. After all, it’s not every day that the former royal family gets added to the records. I hear that written instructions were issued yesterday by the Ministry of the Interior to ensure everything goes smoothly when the request is made. The process is simple: the request is submitted, the Registry Office forwards it to the Ministry of the Interior along with the required documents, and the Ministry determines whether the applicant can be registered or not. That’s what we reported this morning. Eventually, at 11 a.m., it was confirmed that Pavlos and Nikolaos submitted the relevant application at the Athens Registry Office through their proxy lawyer. The surname they chose is “De Grèce,” and a total of 10 members of the former royal family have signed the application. Elections in the Regional Unions It’s a day of decisions for the Union of Greek Regions, as today the successor to Tzitzikostas will be chosen. The role is expected to go to the governor of the South Aegean, Giorgos Hatzimarkos. Following Nikos Hardalias’ announcement that he is withdrawing from the Presidency, the first vice-presidency is set to go to the governor of Crete, Stavros Arnaoutakis, and the second vice-presidency to the governor of the Peloponnese, Dimitris Ptochos. 5% Decrease in Abstention Due to Electoral Roll Cleanup The Ministry of the Interior has received very few applications to reverse deletions from the electoral rolls. This means that in the next national elections, the number of registered voters will be approximately 440,000 fewer. These are individuals aged 80 and above who have had no physical presence in the country or have passed away but had not been removed from the rolls until now due to unreported deaths to the relevant Greek authorities. These individuals contribute to the abstention rates, inflating them by about 5%. Parliament’s New Year Under the Shadow of Presidential Speculation Parliament will suspend its work tonight for the holiday season and is expected to reopen on January 8. Don’t ask me about the legislative agenda because I estimate that the only topic occupying the political and journalistic scene will be the individual proposed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis for the position of President of the Republic. The Prime Minister stated in his interview with ERT that he would reveal the name within the second half of January, triggering another wave of speculation. The official process is expected to commence in Parliament in early February 2025. According to the Constitution, the absolute deadline for the first vote is February 13, one month before the end of Katerina Sakellaropoulou’s term. The first vote requires a majority of 200 MPs; the same threshold applies for the second vote, which takes place five days later. The third vote lowers the threshold to 180 MPs, the fourth to 151 MPs, and, finally, the fifth requires only a relative majority. Poor Anagnostopoulos, what a fate you’ve met After the €5.5 million fines issued yesterday to eight multinational companies, and with more likely to follow for retail chains, no one would want to be in the shoes of the General Secretary of Commerce and Consumer Protection, S. Anagnostopoulos. The General Secretary has been invited tomorrow, Friday, to speak at an internal event of SELPE, the association of major retail chains. The big retail chains are up in arms over the fines, as they believe that the system implemented by the ministry is intentionally convoluted and complex, aimed at imposing fines they deem to serve public relations purposes. So tomorrow, Anagnostopoulos is expected to face heavy pressure as they demand clear rules. Meanwhile, note that a total of 26 companies—multinationals, food manufacturers, and other consumer goods firms, as well as supermarket chains—are under investigation to determine if they comply with the law on profit margin caps. Yesterday’s announcements involved eight companies, so expect more to come in the next few days. The last law passed by Parliament for 2024 extends the validity of the law on “caps on gross profit margins for all products essential for consumer nutrition and dignified living” until April 2025. For now, the government’s intention—provided market conditions stabilize—is not to extend the measure further beyond April, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Hotels: A new investor for Attica Banks are aiming to increase their financing and are closely monitoring tenders and other processes for the sale of European banks’ maritime loan portfolios. Piraeus Bank has taken a significant step by providing over €100 million in financing following a competitive process to the Cypriot Thanos Resort & Hotels, owned by Thanos Michaelides. Michaelides plans to expand his presence in Greece’s hotel sector. The group, which includes the Anassa in Paphos, intends to invest in Attica and Milos. The race to break the €4 barrier Speaking of Piraeus Bank, its stock is once again approaching the €4 mark—the level at which a placement was made last March for 27% of the share capital. Since then, the stock has only managed to stay above this level for three trading sessions, closing at the same price on three other occasions, with an intraday high of €4.08. Yesterday it closed at €3.91, showing an inclination to move toward €4. However, there’s often a gap between intention and reality. We’ll see if the stock gets closer to the generous target prices given by analysts, which range from €5 (Deutsche Bank), €5.90 (JPM), and even €6.31 (Eurobank Equities). Salary increases at SEV The new president of SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises), Spyros Theodoropoulos, brings extensive experience in business transformations and restructuring. He’s undertaking a similar effort at SEV, implementing a new organizational chart and redistributing responsibilities. The goal is to bring SEV’s members closer to society and to activate all members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee in SEV’s daily operations. This ambitious effort demands considerable work from SEV’s 60 employees, which is why one of the new administration’s first decisions was to significantly increase their salaries. Manousakis’ term at ADMIE renewed Last night, ADMIE Holdings sent a letter to the Chinese State Grid announcing the renewal of the term of ADMIE SA’s Chairman and CEO, Manos Manousakis. The term has been renewed for four years. The Board of Directors will meet tomorrow, Friday, to approve the renewal. €110 million investments in clean energy storage Staying in the energy sector, Deputy Energy Minister Alexandra Sdoukou met yesterday with representatives of 15 companies selected in the first two energy storage tenders. The government aims to expedite the construction of energy storage stations, offering operational support and investment aid. Investors, who collectively are investing €110 million in lithium battery energy storage systems, highlighted key issues they face, primarily the need for new connection infrastructure, such as the development or expansion of substations and networks. These processes are often delayed due to lengthy equipment procurement timelines. Additionally, delays in licensing procedures that impact overall project progress were also discussed. Sdoukou pledged to support each case individually, announcing the creation of a special coordination team. This team will work closely with ADMIE, RAE, and DAPEEP to resolve all licensing and technical issues. Timely project completion is critical, as they are funded by the Recovery Fund under strict deadlines. Let’s see if anything gets done! Lavipharm’s Investment Lavipharm’s new investment in transdermal drug production is set to launch in early 2025. The modifications and expansion of part of the production facilities in Paiania have already been completed, and the mechanical equipment is arriving in Greece in the coming period. This investment is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical company’s business plan, as it will double its transdermal production capacity, while the addition of the new production line ensures uninterrupted manufacturing. Over the past five years, Lavipharm has achieved a 55% increase in its market share, and its management has stated that it is exploring opportunities for new drug acquisitions while also making new moves focused on pharmaceutical production. Alumil’s “Trump Trade” Alumil, led by G. Mylonas, is steadily moving towards a market capitalization of €150 million. Its stock, now at €4.59, is 58.2% higher than three months ago. After struggling through the tough years of 2013–2022 and eventually reaching an agreement with banks and servicers to handle its heavy debt load, Alumil is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. The next step is to spin off its casting division and sell 70% of the new company (Alufond) to a foreign investor. G. Mylonas, encouraged by Trump’s election, has turned his gaze across the Atlantic, aiming to finalize the deal within the first quarter of 2025. Even if it slips to the second quarter, it’s no big deal—after all, in the market, you hear a lot of talk but see little action. Window Dressing Next week, the Athens Stock Exchange will remain closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after. Opportunities for short-term investment strategies are extremely limited. The primary goal of window dressing remains a top priority. As previously mentioned, Piraeus Bank aims to bridge the gap to the €4 placement level (yesterday it closed at €3.91, up +1.79%) so that those who invested at that time don’t end the year in the red. Similarly, National Bank has risen to €7.70 (+1.45%), Athens International Airport to €8, Cenergy to €9.25, and so on. By Tuesday, December 31, everyone will close their books with satisfaction and present the results of their efforts to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. These movements, coupled with the lack of large-scale strategic placements, have brought the General Index to 1,455.67 points, with a modest increase of +0.2%. While trading volume may appear higher, it isn’t—of the €155.3 million total, €57.1 million came from a large Eurobank package and several smaller ones, leaving €85 million in stock trades on the board. Once again, Coca-Cola HBC, typically the General Index’s reliable supporter, remained at €32.80 (-1.5%), leaving OPAP (+2.21% at €15.74) and Motor Oil (+1.38%) to take over its role. Meanwhile, a consistent seller is holding PPC at €11.70, despite analysts’ glowing reports making headlines. Nuclear Energy and Artificial Intelligence: Parallel Paths Yesterday, Meta published an RFP (Request for Proposals) seeking a provider for a nuclear energy installation of up to 4 gigawatts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. This move reflects a broader trend in the artificial intelligence industry, where the exponential growth in computational requirements is creating unprecedented demand for stable and reliable energy. Meta’s strategy to place nuclear plants near its data centers aims to minimize energy transmission losses. Given that Meta is already the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U.S., with 6.7 GW in operation, this step marks a new era where nuclear energy suddenly emerges as a key pillar for the growth of artificial intelligence.

Archives An intensification of surface Earth’s energy imbalance since the late 20th century, Li et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm−2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm−2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown. Fusion of Probabilistic Projections of Sea-Level Rise, Grandey et al., Earth's Future: A probabilistic projection of sea-level rise uses a probability distribution to represent scientific uncertainty. However, alternative probabilistic projections of sea-level rise differ markedly, revealing ambiguity, which poses a challenge to scientific assessment and decision-making. To address the challenge of ambiguity, we propose a new approach to quantify a best estimate of the scientific uncertainty associated with sea-level rise. Our proposed fusion combines the complementary strengths of the ice sheet models and expert elicitations that were used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under a low-emissions scenario, the fusion's very likely range (5th–95th percentiles) of global mean sea-level rise is 0.3–1.0 m by 2100. Under a high-emissions scenario, the very likely range is 0.5–1.9 m. The 95th percentile projection of 1.9 m can inform a high-end storyline, supporting decision-making for activities with low uncertainty tolerance. By quantifying a best estimate of scientific uncertainty, the fusion caters to diverse users. Earth's Climate History Explains Life's Temperature Optima, Schipper et al., Ecology and Evolution: Why does the growth of most life forms exhibit a narrow range of optimal temperatures below 40°C? We hypothesize that the recently identified stable range of oceanic temperatures of ~5 to 37°C for more than two billion years of Earth history tightly constrained the evolution of prokaryotic thermal performance curves to optimal temperatures for growth to less than 40°C. We tested whether competitive mechanisms reproduced the observed upper limits of life's temperature optima using simple Lotka–Volterra models of interspecific competition between organisms with different temperature optima. Model results supported our proposition whereby organisms with temperature optima up to 37°C were most competitive. Model results were highly robust to a wide range of reasonable variations in temperature response curves of modeled species. We further propose that inheritance of prokaryotic genes and subsequent co-evolution with microbial partners may have resulted in eukaryotes also fixing their temperature optima within this narrow temperature range. We hope this hypothesis will motivate considerable discussion and future work to advance our understanding of the remarkable consistency of the temperature dependence of life. Widespread outdoor exposure to uncompensable heat stress with warming, Fan & McColl, Communications Earth & Environment: Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events. ["uncompensable" means physiologically intolerable, acutely dangerous, ultimately deadly] Stabilising CO2 concentration as a channel for global disaster risk mitigation, Lu & Tambakis, Scientific Report: We investigate the influence of anthropogenic CO2 concentration fluctuations on the likelihood of climate-related disasters. We calibrate annual incidence rates against global disasters and CO2 growth spanning from 1960 to 2022 based on a dynamic panel logit model. We also study the sensitivity of disaster incidence to stochastic carbon dynamics consistent with IPCC-projected climate outcomes for 2100. The key insight is that present and lagged CO2 growth contains valuable information about the likelihood of future disaster events. We further show that lowering carbon stock uncertainty by dampening the persistence or the variability of CO2 concentration has a first-order impact on mitigating expected disaster risk. Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment, DeVerna et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) used for fact-checking affect the perception and dissemination of political news headlines. Despite the growing adoption of AI and tests of its ability to counter online misinformation, little is known about how people respond to LLM-driven fact-checking. This experiment reveals that even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users’ abilities to discern headline accuracy or promote accurate news sharing. LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is unsure about an article’s veracity. These findings underscore the need for research on AI fact-checking’s unintended consequences, informing policies to enhance information integrity in the digital age. Droughts in Wind and Solar Power: Assessing Climate Model Simulations for a Net-Zero Energy Future, Liu et al., Geophysical Research Letters: Understanding and predicting “droughts” in wind and solar power availability can help the electric grid operator planning and operation toward deep renewable penetration. We assess climate models' ability to simulate these droughts at different horizontal resolutions, ∼100 and ∼25 km, over Western North America and Texas. We find that these power droughts are associated with the high/low pressure systems. The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes. This suggests that regional response to future warming can vary considerably in high- and low-resolution models. These insights have important implications for adapting power system planning and operations to the changing climate.

One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance. Most articles appearing here are found via RSS feeds from journal publishers, filtered by search terms to produce raw output for assessment of relevance. Relevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database. The objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only: A few journals offer public access to "preprint" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as "preprint." The section "Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of "perspectives," observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc. Please let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important.

Title: Amazon delays return to office for thousands of workers due to lack of space

Full Content:
Seattle â Amazon.com will not have enough space for thousands of employees when they start returning to the office five days a week in January.Â The company recently told some staff working in at least seven cities â including Austin, Dallas and Phoenix â that their return dates will be pushed back as much as four months, according to people familiar with the situation. The delay is the latest twist in a return-to-office (RTO) saga that has roiled Amazonâs normally heads-down workforce. Some employees say they are unhappy about being asked to come in full-time when many of their tech industry peers have more flexible work arrangements.Â Amazon employs more than 350,000 corporate employees worldwide â mostly in the US â and it is not clear precisely how many people are affected by the RTO delays. A company spokesperson said the vast majority of employees will have desks starting on Jan 2. Â Employees in Dallas were recently told there would not be sufficient space for them all to work five days a week in the office until March or April, one of the sources said. Some workers in the companyâs Midtown Manhattan office in the Lord & Taylor building might not have space for full-time work until May, another source said. Amazon also notified employees in Atlanta, Nashville and Houston that it did not have sufficient space for them all to return in January, Business Insider reported on Dec 16. When chief executive Andy Jassy announced the aggressive return-to-work mandate in September, he and other executives said it was necessary to nurture an eroding company culture. But some employees suspect the mandate is an effort to thin the ranks and avoid layoffs and severance payments. Amazon denies this.Â Employees say they have proved in recent years that teams can be effective while working remotely. Some of those affected by the RTO delay reacted with relief â evidence that the five-day office mandate is widely unpopular. For more than a year, most Amazon employees have been asked to badge in three days a week, though there are exceptions for teams and fully remote positions. Amazon did not have enough seats ready for that initial RTO plan, including in Bellevue, Washington, where the company has focused much of its headquarters growth after building out its Seattle campus. Some workers say the company is still struggling to host employees three days a week. In recent interviews, employees complained of working from shared desks, crowded corporate canteens and a lack of conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. The company has added a feature to its room-reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work.Â It is not an ideal moment to be seeking new office space. While vacancies soared as remote work surged during the pandemic, there is now a shortage of the high-quality space typically leased by tech companies. Amazon has been leasing temporary space from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley in recent weeks, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed. Coming out of the pandemic, Amazon froze hiring and tapped the brakes on its own real estate development, pausing high-profile office projects in Bellevue, Nashville, and at the companyâs second headquarters campus in Arlington, Virginia. Some of those projects have since resumed and could eventually ease the strain.Â A spokesperson said that in most cases, the RTO delays are the result of reconfigurations of buildings that had been laid out to accommodate part-time remote workers, rather than a lack of available office space.

Executives at major companies are referencing a specific term to hedge when asked by employees if they plan to follow in Amazon's footsteps and implement a return to 5 days a week in the office. That word? Productivity. While Amazon has been the most high-profile example this year of a full return to office policy, set to go into effect in January, telecom giant AT&T has also elected to double down on in-person work with a similar 5-day policy, Business Insider first reported. In the wake of Amazon's announcement, executives at both Google and Microsoft, which require employees to be in the office at least 3 days a week, have fielded questions from staff wondering if the days of hybrid work are numbered. Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and AI, Scott Guthrie, said the company wouldn't change the hybrid work policy unless it noticed a drop in productivity, BI reported in September. In October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company had no plans to order employees back to the office, so long as employees remain productive during their at-home work days, BI previously reported. Over at Meta, Mark Zuckerberg said last year that "early analysis of performance data," indicated productivity increases for early-career engineers in the office at least 3 days a week. A few months later, the company announced it was requiring employees to return to the office 3 days a week. Executives at Dell called the company's sales team back to the office 5 days a week starting at the end of September, writing in a memo, "Our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite." Though Amazon did not explicitly name productivity as a reason for its full return to the office, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized a similar term: effectiveness. Being back in person 5 days a week makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," he wrote at the time. For those committing to a full return to office, preparing campuses for the influx of employees in the new year is its own challenge. Amazon has since delayed the announced January 2 effective date of the new mandate for some employees because it doesn't have enough office space in some locations, BI reported earlier this month. As CEOs and company leaders keep an eye on how employees in remote or hybrid setups perform, various studies since the onset of the pandemic have attempted to measure and compare the productivity of employees who work at home and in-office. Research studies have produced conflicting results, further complicated by the matter of how best to define or measure productivity. Goldman Sachs, which has a 5-day-in-office policy, reviewed several analyses that used different ways of evaluating changes in work-from-home productivity, from call-center workers who were randomly chosen to work from home to comparing the productivity of randomly assigned remote workers with their in-office peers. In short, it's hard to say for sure, and executives are deciding what their long-term setup will be after a year in which some of the world's biggest companies put a renewed focus on being "lean" and "efficient." Meanwhile, some employees have returned to commuting in (sometimes "coffee-badging" in and returning home), others have relocated to comply with a policy change, and some have resigned to pursue a hybrid or fully remote opportunity. As companies tighten their belts and conduct layoffs, other workers have taken to workplace forums to wonder if some of the RTO mandates have been a possible "quiet layoffs" tactic. As more major global companies revisit their policies and make changes, CEOs are likely to face more questions on the topic going into the new year. For some, the answer is simple: Stay productive and we'll stay flexible. Jump to

Title: AT&T, Sweetgreen Follow Amazon’s Lead With New Return-to-Office Mandates

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Telecom giant at&t and salad chain Sweetgreen are the latest companies to follow in Amazon’s footsteps when it comes to return-to-office mandates for 2025. AT&T will require all corporate staffers to go into the office five days per week starting in January, while Sweetgreen’s non-frontline employees will be expected in the office four days per week in the new year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. The specific policies for each company will vary by organization and location, Bloomberg reported. Both companies switched from their current policy requiring workers in the office roughly three days a week to the new mandates after Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy announced in September that all of the tech giant’s office workers must return to their desks five days per week in 2025. “That was the big turning point where everyone’s like, ‘Oh, they’re doing it, now we can do it,’” Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman told Bloomberg. A spokesperson for Sweetgreen did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. AT&T’s employees, meanwhile, have largely already been working in the office five days a week, even during the pandemic, a spokesperson for the company told Commercial Observer. “We always adapt our workforce model to drive collaboration and innovation to deliver the best support for our customers,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “As we continue to evolve our model, we are enhancing our facilities and workspaces, adapting our benefits programs, and incorporating best practices to ensure our employees are best equipped to serve our customers.” AT&T is tightening its return-to-office policy after CEO John Stankey said in 2023 that more than 60,000 managers would have to relocate amid an office consolidation, with some suggesting the move was a cover-up for mass layoffs, Bloomberg reported. Ever since Amazon’s announcement in September, more and more companies have formed their own return-to-office mandates. That includes Starbucks, which told its corporate staff in October they must work in the office three days per week starting next year, or else they could be fired, CO reported.

Title: Michael Saylor says he’d be willing to advise Trump on crypto matters

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor said Wednesday that he would be willing to provide advisory support to President-elect Donald Trump on crypto matters if asked. “I’m always willing to provide a thought on constructive digital asset policy either in confidence or publicly. And if I’m asked to serve on some sort of Digital Assets Advisory Council. I probably would,” said Saylor, speaking on Bloomberg Open Interest. While Saylor confirmed meeting with many people in the incoming Trump administration, he declined to provide further details. The statement comes as MicroStrategy prepares to join the Nasdaq-100 alongside Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise, replacing Super Micro Computer, Moderna, and Illumina, effective December 23. However, the company’s Bitcoin holdings could jeopardize its index position. MicroStrategy recently acquired an additional $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at approximately $45 billion. The massive Bitcoin stash might lead to MicroStrategy’s reclassification as a financial company in a March review by the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). This reclassification would likely result in the company’s removal from the Nasdaq-100, as the index exclusively comprises non-financial firms. Addressing concerns surrounding MicroStrategy’s reclassification, Saylor asserted that the company is not solely reliant on its Bitcoin investments. The software division generates significant operating income, which he quantifies at about $75 million per year. “We have a very healthy software division now and we’re very proud of it,” Saylor stated. He noted that he had no plans to spin off MicroStrategy. “It’s profitable and it’s a core part of the company’s identity.” “We also think of ourselves primarily as a Bitcoin Treasury company now. So our primary method of generating shareholder value is through our Treasury operations,” Saylor noted. “There are three ways to create value for shareholders; there’s operating income and our software business generates about $75 million a year of operating income. There’s also investment income that’s been difficult to track. But right now we have $18.6 billion of unrealized investment income,” he added. Saylor noted that MicroStrategy “is engaged” in strategic acquisitions similar to practices seen in other tech companies like Apple. MicroStrategy has acquired around $17 billion worth of Bitcoin since announcing its 21/21 plan to fund its future Bitcoin purchases. With this pace of accumulation, the company could reach its $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition target by January 2025. When asked about potential adjustments to the plan, Saylor indicated that MicroStrategy would re-evaluate its capital allocation strategy once the $42 billion target is met. “When we get through the 21/21 plan, which has $42 billion in capital, we’ll revisit our capital plan and we’ll put in place a new plan subject to market conditions at the time,” he said. Saylor said that the company expects to lean more heavily towards raising capital through fixed-income markets in the coming quarter to increase leverage, which would enhance returns for its common stock shareholders. While fixed income is the primary focus, they will also consider other options like preferred stock, convertible bonds, or equity-linked financings, depending on market conditions, according to Saylor. MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin investment led to its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, but its entry into the S&P 500 seems unlikely due to failing the index’s profitability requirements. The company has been profitable in only one of the past four quarters, a key criterion for S&P 500 inclusion, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared in a statement. Despite this, upcoming changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may improve MicroStrategy’s financial reporting, according to the analyst. Discussing MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500, Saylor noted that the decision-making process and specific criteria are beyond his expertise. However, he expressed optimism about future prospects. “I’m optimistic that in 2025, when we adopt fair value accounting, we end up with $50 billion of assets on our balance sheet, under fair value of Bitcoin goes up 20% a year, you’re looking at $10 billion a year of investment income,” Saylor said. “I expect we’ll be generating billions of dollars a year or tens of billions of dollars a year of investment income, which becomes GAAP profitability,” he added. “I think that is the final thing people are looking for in inclusion in the S&P.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Amazon Delays Return-to-Office Mandate in Several Cities for Lack of Office Space

Amazon will delay a requirement that all employees work from the office in at least seven major cities, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The reason? The online retail giant just doesn’t have enough office space for their employees to work. Amazon first announced in September that corporate employees would soon need to work from the office five days a week, something that has roiled workers who have found many companies offering more flexible work-from-home arrangements since the start of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The start of this new return-to-office mandate was supposed to be the start of the new year. But workers in at least seven cities have been told they won’t need to come into the office that frequently until more office space is found, according to Bloomberg. The cities include Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, New York, and Phoenix, and it’s not clear how many of Amazon’s 350,000 corporate employees globally will be impacted, though Amazon told Bloomberg the “vast majority” of workers will return to the office on Jan. 2. Why does Amazon want workers to return to the office? When Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced the move in a blog post on Sept. 16, he tossed out a slew of buzzwords that don’t actually mean anything and were incredibly confusing. One sentence that sticks out was filled with so many commas and semicolons you’d be hard-pressed to find any succinct meaning in it at all: Iâve previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, weâve observed that itâs easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. Okay. What’s the real reason Amazon would be doing this? There are two dominant theories. The first is that commercial real estate has suffered since the onset of the covid pandemic and artificially propping up real estate values helps the ruling class. It’s funny, of course, that Amazon is struggling to find enough office space in this scenario. The second theory is that Amazon wants to do layoffs but instead is opting to make things harder for employees as a way to get workers to quit on their own. When you lay corporate workers off it’s often necessary to provide severance, but if someone quits on their own, the company doesn’t need to deal with those extra costs. This strategy isn’t new but does seem to encourage the most sought-after employees to leave since they can find work at competing companies. In fact, a recent study found that companies that had the most strict return-to-office mandates had higher turnover rates and were losing their most senior and skilled employees. Female employees had a turnover rate three times higher than men, likely as a result of women bearing a higher burden for childcare and domestic responsibilities in the U.S. When Amazon finally finds enough office space to house all its employees, workers will still be confronted with the fact that modern office design is garbage. American businesses have built communal working spaces where people work individually and enclosed rooms that can be rented for big meetings that would be ideal for individuals. That creates unnecessary conflict in the office. From Bloomberg: Some workers say the company is still struggling to host people three days a week. In recent interviews, employees complained of working from shared desks, crowded corporate canteens and a lack of conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. The company has added a feature to its room reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work. But what are you going to do? Work from home and actually get some work done? That’s not going to keep those commercial real estate prices up, is it?

Title: Walmart had a gangbusters year

Walmart (WMT) has delivered an exceptional year that has transformed its market position. The retailer’s shares surged more than 80% in 2024, pushing its market value to $768 billion after adding $340 billion in market capitalization. The retail giant’s exceptional performance has been driven by its success in attracting wealthier shoppers and growth in advertising and marketing revenue, allowing it to emerge as one of the top performers on the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. While inflation has challenged most retailers in 2024, Walmart has turned market headwinds into an advantage, delivering its strongest performance since 1998. The retailer’s share price gains and margin growth have outpaced most traditional retail competitors, drawing comparisons to higher-growth industries. Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, told Bloomberg that Walmart’s stock “looks more like something that’s technologically oriented,” referring to its robust growth and profitability, which rival those of the historically high-performing tech giants. This tech-like performance comes as Walmart ramps up its digital capabilities. With its continued investment in technology, product offerings, and supply chain operations, Baird analysts project Walmart will compete directly with Amazon in the coming years. This positioning highlights Walmart’s influence as it continues to attract shoppers of all income cohorts – especially wealthier ones. In the most recent quarter, around 75% of Walmart’s sales came from households earning $100,000 a year or more. To court those more affluent shoppers, Walmart has modernized its stores with refreshed layouts, expanded product assortments, and improved lighting while rolling back prices on more than 7,000 items to maintain momentum with budget-conscious customers. “Walmart has found a sweet spot,” Greg Zakowicz, senior e-commerce expert at software company Omnisend, told Quartz in an interview. “It’s successfully serving both higher-income shoppers looking to save on groceries and lower-income shoppers seeking the best value.” These updates have positioned Walmart to compete across the retail spectrum. While its enhanced shopping experience puts pressure on Target (TGT) and Amazon (AMZN), the company is also targeting the discount retail space. Citigroup’s (C) Paul Lejuez suggests that Walmart’s expanded offerings and focus on delivery, coupled with its Walmart+ Assist program for low-income customers, will allow it to take market share from retailers like Dollar General (DG). Earlier this month, Dollar General said it would test same-day delivery at 75 locations to keep up with Walmart. Moreover, Walmart’s reliance on its advertising and membership revenue, which make up nearly one-third of its operating income, has given it room to reduce prices while growing its margins. RBC Capital Markets (RY) analyst Steven Shemesh noted that these pursuits set Walmart apart from other retailers struggling to achieve similar growth. That said, not all analysts expect Walmart’s gangbusters year to extend into 2025. Redburn Atlantic analyst Daniela Nedialkova warns that given macroeconomic pressures, next year may not replicate the stellar stock gains seen this year.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Title: Cohere, a $5.5B Canadian A.I. Startup, Is Quietly Working with Peter Thiel’s Palantir

Since bursting into the A.I. scene five years ago, the Canadian startup Cohere has emerged as a rival to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Backed by tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Salesforce, it’s managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster its mission to develop A.I. models for enterprises. Cohere’s partners include software giant Oracle, Japanese telecom company Fujitsu and, as first reported by TechCrunch this week, the data analytics company Palantir. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Founded more than two decades ago by Peter Thiel, Palantir provides data analytics software for major businesses and government agencies. While Cohere has yet to officially announce the partnership, a segment during Palantir’s developer conference in November detailed its work with the startup, which has already seen Cohere’s models deployed to Palantir customers. Cohere and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. Cohere’s partnership with Palantir appears to focus on Palantir’s Foundry platform, which serves corporate clients. Billy Trend, a senior software engineer at Cohere, noted his excitement “about working with Palantir” during the conference. He discussed the startup’s engagement with an unnamed Palantir customer who had “strict constraints” on data storage and was looking to conduct its inference in Arabic—a task Trend described as “a great opportunity” for Cohere’s multilingual capabilities. Headquartered in Toronto and San Francisco, Cohere was established in 2019 by former Google researchers Nick Frosst, Ivan Zhang and Aiden Gomez. Gomez notably co-authored the 2017 “Attention is All You Need Paper,” which led to pivotal breakthroughs in machine learning. Instead of pushing consumer products or advancements in artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.) research like its competitors, Cohere has positioned itself as a startup focused on building tailored models for enterprise clients like McKinsey and Deloitte. Its low-profile strategy has attracted the attention of corporate investors like Cisco, AMD and Fujitsu, all of whom participated in a $500 million funding round in July that valued the startup at $5.5 billion—more than doubling its previous valuation of $2.1 billion a year earlier. Other backers of Cohere include renowned A.I. academics Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li. Some of Cohere’s largest competitors have becoming increasingly cozy with defense clients in recent months. In November, Palantir announced plans to team up with Anthropic and Amazon (AMZN) in a partnership that will provide Anthropic’s A.I. models to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Earlier this month, OpenAI inked a military deal with the defense company Anduril that will see its technology infused into anti-drone systems. Between August of 2022 and 2023, the value of A.I.-related federal contracts soared 150 percent to a staggering $675 million, according to a study from the Brookings Institute.

Title: 6 Best ETFs To Buy And Invest In 2025

Time Published: 2024-12-18T17:07:56Z

getty Megacap stocks dominated in 2024, creating nice returns for anyone invested in the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500. Unfortunately, no financial market trend lasts forever. Many pundits believe the megacap growth could pause in 2025, leaving room for other stock market segments to take the lead. If you agree with that prediction, you may need to reset your exchange-traded fund portfolio for the year ahead. Let's explore three critical ETF selection criteria and meet six ETFs that may be winners in 2025. You have many ETF options available, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming. To keep your search efficient, focus on low-expense funds that deliver the appropriate risk and market exposure. ETFs have administrative expenses that they pass on to shareholders. The funds disclose these expenses as an expense ratio. The ratio is a percentage representing shareholders' annual expense burden. In 2016, Morningstar published a white paper stating that the "expense ratio is the most proven predictor of future fund returns." The paper included the recommendation that investors evaluate expense ratios early in their selection process. That recommendation still stands today. Only one of the ETFs introduced below has an expense ratio above 0.04%. A 0.04% expense ratio equates to $4 in expenses annually for every $10,000 invested. Managing risk according to what you can handle is a primary investing responsibility. Too much or too little risk undermines your commitment to the strategy. Whether your portfolio is too volatile or too conservative, the common reaction is the same: You'll want to change things. Emotional decision-making can result and returns can suffer. So, think about the risk level you want, with the understanding that risk and reward go together. High risk means greater earnings potential but with volatility. Low risk means less volatility and lower gain potential. Market exposure refers to the types of assets the fund holds. For example, a fund that replicates the S&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest public companies, has large-cap exposure. A fund that holds Nasdaq-100 stocks has large-cap technology exposure. Your targeted exposure should align with your risk tolerance.

Let's explore each of these funds in more detail below. Schwab's small-cap ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index. The fund provides easy, diversified access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. stock market. In 2025, smaller companies stand to benefit from falling interest rates and, possibly, deregulation and lower corporate tax rates courtesy of a new presidential administration. These conditions encourage growth and expansion, which are primary goals for small companies. Larger companies may not see the same boost. Big corporations often have higher concentrations of fixed-rate debt, which doesn't reprice to lower market rates until refinanced. As well, large-caps with international revenue sources will see a lesser impact from tax cuts. As well, large-caps are plagued by high valuations right now, which contributes to volatility. The current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the S&P 500 is 31. The SCHA portfolio compares favorably on this metric, with a PE ratio of 18. SSGA's mid-cap fund tracks the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index. Holdings include Williams Sonoma (WSM), DocuSign (DOCU) and Burlington Stores (BURL). Mid-sized companies should see the same tailwinds as small caps in 2025—but with the potential for better results. Mid-caps are more established, mature and profitable than small caps. They also have better access to capital, which makes them more resilient. Resilience could play a role if the economic and policy tailwinds don't materialize as expected. If the Fed takes its time lowering interest rates, for example, mid-caps could outperform small-caps and large-caps next year. SPMD's PE ratio is 18.7, slightly higher than the Schwab small-cap fund. iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF tracks the S&P Total Market Index. The index intends to represent all segments of the stock market, from microcaps to megacaps. If you don't want to bet on one market segment, this fund covers all bases. The portfolio includes companies of all sizes and from all economic sectors. For better or worse, ITOT will deliver market-level returns, minus a few basis points for fund expenses. Note that the ITOT portfolio is weighted by market capitalization, so the biggest companies are held in the largest proportions. Concentration risk is a concern—the “Magnificent 7” megacap stocks will have undue influence over the entire group's performance.

The index and the fund are sector-diversified with larger holdings in financials, industrials and healthcare. As we close out 2024, growth stock valuations are running high. This trend could continue, stretching stock prices even higher relative to earnings. Or, it could reverse in a pullback. Either way, the conditions look good for value stocks to shine as a counterpoint. Investors may add value stock exposure to offset the rising risk of high valuations in growth, or in response to a reset. VTV is an easy option to secure that exposure. The fund holds premier value stock names, including Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and Procter & Gamble (PG), plus the AI stock Broadcom (AVGO). Invesco's high dividend low volatility fund tracks an index that includes 50 dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks. The holdings are primarily large-caps with value characteristics. SPHD is popular among income investors. To learn more, see how to build an ETF portfolio for income and best ETFs for income investing. While investors are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. economy and the Republican agenda, there is an undercurrent of uncertainty. Certain policy changes, such as new tariffs, could invite inflation. Lingering inflation, in turn, would slow the pace of the Fed's interest rate cuts. When investor uncertainty is combined with high valuations and over-concentration in the S&P 500, volatility can result. The high income and low volatility characteristics of SPHD's portfolio could provide some shelter if the market turns into a rollercoaster in 2025. Vanguard's VGLT fund holds Treasury bonds with maturities ranging from 10 to 25 years. As of December 2024, the average coupon rate is 3.2% and the yield to maturity is 4.5%. Long-term bonds are reactive to market interest rate changes because they don't reprice as quickly as short-term bonds. The pricing response goes in the opposite direction of interest rates. Given the prevailing opinion that rates will decline in 2025, today's long-term bonds may carry above-market rates sometime next year. That will drive their value on the secondary market higher. VGLT provides that long-term bond exposure. The fund is a suitable diversification option within or outside a Vanguard retirement investing portfolio. As an ETF investor, there are times when you want protection from certain elements of the market. Factors to watch currently include high valuations and the excessive influence of megacaps. Diversifying your ETF portfolio with small cap, midcap and value stock exposure may provide the protection you need in the year ahead. Total U.S. stock market ETFs with low expense ratios are suitable for beginners in 2025. These provide exposure to all U.S. economic sectors, small to large companies and a blend of growth and value characteristics. To choose an ETF, first decide what type of assets you need—as in stocks, bonds or a combination. Then, review funds that align with your needs and select one with a low expense ratio, low tracking error, long history of performance and good trading volume. ETFs are not necessarily better than stocks. ETFs can be more appropriate for novice investors than individual stocks because ETFs are diversified. The most tax-efficient ETFs are those that pay no dividends or interest. Many ETFs will make capital gains distributions annually, which are taxable. You can defer the tax liability of ETF income and gains by holding the funds in a tax-advantaged account. Yes, you can lose money with ETFs. You can mitigate the risk of loss somewhat by choosing diversified funds and holding them for years or decades, rather than months.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock climbed during Wednesday morning trading after slumping into correction territory earlier in the week. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 3.5% before noon Wednesday after falling into a correction at market close Monday. Nvidia’s shares continued falling by almost 3% Tuesday. The company’s shares are up by 180% so far this year. Meanwhile, rival chip designer Broadcom (AVGO) closed up more than 11% Monday after it soared 20% Friday to surpass the $1 trillion market cap for the first time. The chipmaker reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue for the fourth quarter ended in November. On the company’s earnings call, Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan said it sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote that Broadcom was having an “Nvidia moment” in a Monday note, reported by MarketWatch. Rasgon noted “a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out.” However, Broadcom’s stock fell by more than 5% Tuesday, and its shares were down by more than 3% during Wednesday morning trading. The chipmaker’s shares are up by almost 103% so far this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) reportedly bought twice as many of Nvidia’s Hopper chips as its rivals this year. The tech giant is estimated to have bought 485,000 of the chips — more than double Nvidia’s second-largest U.S. customer, Meta (META), which bought 224,000, the Financial Times reported, citing analysts at technology consultancy Omdia. The analysts estimate Amazon (AMZN) bought 196,000 Hopper chips, and Google (GOOGL) bought 169,000. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: A millennial couple worth seven figures invests most of their money in 3 ETFs but owns one individual stock and 1.5 bitcoin. Take a look at their portfolio.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-millionaire-couple-invests-their-money-etfs-meta-bitcoin-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-18T15:50:53Z
Full Content:
After paying off a six-figure mortgage and student loans, Brennan and Erin Schlagbaum shifted their focus from debt paydown to wealth-building. Without a mortgage, the couple was able to save the majority of their income. They put most of their money in low-cost index funds and, over time, their brokerage account surpassed the $1 million mark, according to an account screenshot viewed by Business Insider. BI spoke with Brennan, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, about his investment strategy and what he held in his portfolio as of December 2024. For years, nearly all of the couple's stock-market money was in three Vanguard index funds: a total stock market fund (VTSAX), a total international stock fund (VTIAX), and an emerging markets index fund (VEMAX). In October 2024, they moved 100% of their index funds to ETFs within all of their accounts in response to Vanguard's rollout of automatic ETF investing. They switched to Vanguard's equivalent ETFs, which you can find on the overview page of the index fund. For example, the equivalent ETF of VTSAX, which Schlagbaum said was their biggest holding, is VTI. The equivalent of their VTIAX holding is VXUS, and the equivalent of their VEMAX holding is VWO. ETFs and index funds are similar — in fact, many ETFs are index funds — and can offer long-term returns, diversification, and cost savings thanks to low expense ratios. One key difference is how they're traded: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, while index funds can only be bought and sold once a day at the close of the trading day. ETFs also typically require a lower investment minimum. You can buy a Vanguard ETF for as little as $1, for example, whereas most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum. The Schlagbaums switched to ETFs for two main reasons: One, they're slightly cheaper. For example, VTSAX has an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VTI has one of 0.03%. Two, ETFs may offer tax savings when compared to index funds. ETF investors are taxed only when they sell the investment, while investors who own mutual funds — and index funds qualify as mutual funds — are liable for paying some capital gains taxes when a fund sells assets and realizes a gain. Just because they're putting their money into ETFs doesn't mean their strategy is shifting. They're still playing the long-term, buy-and-hold game, Schlagbaum said, adding that, "if you stay in index funds, it's not going to make or break you long-term." The way he sees it, the ETFs he converted to are very similar in terms of their holdings, just slightly less expensive and more tax-efficient: "It's like, why wouldn't you take it? It's low-hanging fruit, in my opinion." Schlagbaum owns one individual stock: Meta Platforms (META), which he said he bought in October 2022 when the stock price dipped to $97. He prefers index-fund investing to stock picking and especially doesn't like to try to time the market, "but we did time the market a little bit there," he said. "It just seemed like such an obvious buy." He considers META, which is at $624 as of December 16, 2024, "my biggest win of all time." That said, "If you're an investor and you're just starting, individual stocks should not be on your radar. That gets people into so much trouble, and it's not necessary to build wealth. The best investors have the bulk of their portfolio in ETFs and index funds." The couple owns a primary residence, but no investment properties. "If something breaks in my house, I call somebody, even if it's a hanging up a picture," said Schlagbaum. While he has zero interest in managing more than one home, he recognizes the benefit of diversifying his portfolio with real estate, which is why syndication deals make sense for him. A real estate syndication is when investors pool money to purchase a property. Once they contribute capital, their role in the deal becomes completely passive. The real-estate syndicator is responsible for finding the deal, executing the transaction, and, ultimately, delivering returns to the investors. "You lose control from that aspect. You don't really have control over how that performs," said Schlagbaum, who invests in five multi-family syndications. But if you work with a syndicator with a good track record that you trust, "I think it's one of the best ways for somebody that hates real estate but understands the tax benefits of real estate to get in, because you don't have to do anything." A small sliver, 1-5%, of the couple's portfolio is in bitcoin. "We have 1.5, and that position is sitting at $150,000 based on the price right now," said Schlagbaum. "But it's really just 1.5 bitcoin in general. That's going to move with whatever the pricing is, but that's been a huge grower. We were buying at around 15,000, and now it's at 100 plus thousand." When it comes to highly speculative assets, he believes in having a number of things in order before investing: "Bills paid, emergency fund intact, bad debt paid off, retirement secured, non-retirement invested, all other financial goals are handled — and then, if you have extra money, I think bitcoin is a solid buy."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indices declined sharply after the Federal Open Market Committee announced a quarter percentage point reduction in interest rates on Wednesday afternoon and just two more interest rate cuts in 2025. With that, the Dow had its first ten-day losing streak, the longest since 1974. In its final interest rate decision of the year, the Fed implemented its third consecutive cut, bringing the interest rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. “Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,” the FOMC said in a statement. “Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.” The central bank indicated that it could carry out just two more reductions to the federal funds rate in 2025, given quarter-point cuts, according to its updated Summary of Economic Projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell similarly signaled that the Fed will take a “more cautious” approach to monetary policy next year. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a press conference Wednesday. “And as long as the economy in the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Powell said that the decision to cut rates was a “closer call” than previous reductions, but that the FOMC ultimately decided it was “the right call” to balance inflation and labor market goals. After the market closed, the Dow was down over 1,100 points, or 2.5%. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Moreover, Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which declined earlier this week, bounced back on Wednesday. Micron Technology (MU) is set to announce its quarterly results after the closing bell. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: Is Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (FCCQ) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-canadian-high-quality-etf-144420923.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand. At the same time, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since May 2020, sparking worries about potential inflationary pressures on imports. While the future remains uncertain, the Canadian ETF industry, which began with the world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990, has shown notable resilience over the past 30+ years, and continued growth is expected in the years to come. Despite the market volatility this year, Canadian ETFs have managed to navigate the challenges effectively and are well-positioned for another strong year. With only a couple of weeks remaining in the year, the industry is on track to surpass the previous annual record of $58 billion set in 2021. Moreover, following recent data from IFIC showing Canadian ETF sales reached their third-best month ever in October, a new report from research firm ETFGI highlights additional gains in November, along with impressive year-to-date figures. The firm reported net inflows of US$7.5 billion in November, slightly down from the C$8.2 billion reported in IFIC’s October report, but still a strong performance that contributes to the 29th consecutive month of net inflows. Our Methodology We have selected the top Canadian ETFs to buy and hold based on their 5-year performance as of December 10, listed in ascending order for clarity. Additionally, we’ve highlighted the top holdings of each ETF to provide valuable insights for potential investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A person with a cell phone who is looking for new stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 45.75% The Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) aims to mirror the performance of the Fidelity Canada Canadian High Quality Index. As of December 9, it holds net assets of $214.4 million and has a management expense ratio of 0.39%. This ETF focuses on equity securities from large- and mid-cap Canadian companies, emphasizing higher-quality profiles compared to the broader Canadian equity market. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) holds the largest position in this Fidelity ETF. On December 4, Loop Capital upgraded the company’s stock from Hold to Buy, citing its innovative use of artificial intelligence to enhance merchant tools and optimize internal operations. The brokerage also raised its price target to $140, representing a 23% potential upside. Loop Capital emphasized that these AI-driven advancements are enabling Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) to grow revenue faster than expenses, improving operating and free cash flow margins. With consistent annual sales growth exceeding 20%, the company is well-positioned to enhance profitability and valuation further. Additionally, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) reported record-breaking Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) sales of $11.5 billion, a 24% increase from the previous year. This robust performance suggests the company is on track to meet or surpass consensus expectations for fourth-quarter Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growth, currently forecasted at 23.5%. Rowan Street Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has been an incredibly rewarding investment for those lucky enough to get in early after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. The shares have delivered a return of 2,600% or 42% annual. Its revenues have grown at 49% per annum since the end of 2014 from $105 million to estimated $8.6 billion in 2024. The massive e-commerce market is a huge opportunity, as the company’s growth indicates. As you tell from the chart below, revenues are forecasted to grow above 20% for the next 3 years. Keep in mind, Shopify has been around for more than a decade — and it’s still growing at these high rates. Overall, FCCQ ranks 9th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of FCCQ, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FCCQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

December 18, 2024 09:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology in computer science that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits with a value of 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, enabling them to solve complex problems much faster. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, healthcare, and materials science. The quantum computing market is expected to grow significantly due to increasing research and development in quantum technology, patent filings, and quantum initiatives from various organizations. A report from Technavio projected that the global quantum computing market size is estimated to grow by USD 17.34 billion from 2024-2028, according to Technavio. The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 26.37% during the forecast period. Increasing expenditure by stakeholders is driving market growth, with a trend towards growth of ai and machine learning. The report said: “The quantum computing market is experiencing significant growth as businesses explore the potential of this revolutionary technology. Quantum computing, based on quantum theory and mechanics, promises to solve complex problems faster than classical computers. Key trends include AI, cloud computing, and partnerships with tech giants like AMD. Patent filings indicate a focus on hardware and software development, with applications in various sectors such as biomedical simulations, optimization, and manufacturing. Active Tech Companies in the markets today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), D-Wave Quantum Inc., (NYSE: QBTS), NVIDIA CORPORATION (NASDAQ: NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), IBM (NYSE: IBM). Technavio continued “Quantum computing is expected to disrupt industries like electronics, telecommunications, and financial services, with potential use cases in areas like AI drug discovery, energy optimization, and logistics networks. Error mitigation and suppression techniques are crucial for quantum computing hardware, while quantum simulators and networking are driving research and development. Security concerns are being addressed through quantum-accelerated cryptography. The market is expected to grow, with tech media and IDG predicting increased customer spend on quantum computing resources. Quantum computing is poised to bring innovation to information technology, high-performance computing, and consumer technology markets, with potential applications in areas like weather forecasting, traffic optimization, and energy optimization and land surveys.” ZenaTech Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ZENA) to Use Quantum Computing for Wildfire Tracking in the Western US; Part of a Third LOI for Land Survey Company Acquisition – ZenaTech, a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Quantum Computing, Drone as a Service (DaaS), and enterprise SaaS solutions, announces today that it has signed an LOI (Letter of Intent) to acquire a third land survey engineering company. The acquired company, located in the Western region of the US, will use drones for land surveys and to survey large tracks of land for wildfires and fire management applications on Native American reservations. In addition, Quantum Computing will be added to AI drone capabilities to accommodate large-size datasets. This third acquisition will form the base of ZenaTech’s drone operations in the Western US region, providing local access to the ZenaDrone 1000 and the IQ series of drones, along with the previously announced LOIs for anchor acquisitions in the Southeast and Southern regions of the US. “Signing an LOI to acquire a third land survey company is another step towards our vision for a national DaaS business, bringing AI drone speed and precision to innovate legacy business applications across verticals. Having received multiple requests from Native American groups, we look forward to applying advanced technologies like AI and Quantum Computing to practical and sought-after use cases such as fire management,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. ZenaTech has an existing joint venture partnership with a Native American company to manufacture and sell drones for use by Native American Nations across the US for use in applications like land survey, search and rescue, cargo delivery and fire management. The ZenaTech team has met with many Native American leaders interested in using ZenaDrone 1000 to scan massive tracts of land, over 300 square miles, for fire management applications that are of particular interest to those located in the Western area of the US. The level of datasets required for these expansive areas and applications can only be accomplished using Quantum Computing technology. ZenaTech previously announced the launch of the Sky Traffic project which will utilize its AI drones, Quantum Computing, and specialized teams to develop and test advanced traffic management and weather forecasting applications using large datasets and Amazon Web Services computing devices and platforms. Quantum Computing is a type of computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information at speeds and efficiencies far beyond traditional classical computers, enabling complex problem-solving and simulations. AI drones can survey and collect massive amounts of real-time data on weather, fire conditions, and terrain, which can then be processed using Quantum Computing to create highly accurate predictive models. The synergy of AI drones with Quantum Computing can result in more efficient fire detection, response and prevention, minimizing the impact of wildfires on lives, property, and the environment. Drones are already useful in surveillance, detection, and firefighting, while Quantum Computing, although still emerging, can enhance predictive capabilities, resource optimization, and modeling of complex fire behavior. ZenaTech’s Drone as a Service or DaaS, is a convenient and flexible pay-as-you-go model enabling business users to benefit from the efficiencies of using drones for applications like surveillance and inspection, crop management, or land surveying, without having to buy the hardware and software, or acquire the pilot certifications and regulatory approvals needed to implement. In land survey applications, remotely piloted and autonomous drones with an array of sensors and cameras, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and GPS systems, capture and analyze high-resolution pictures and aerial data across expansive terrains in a matter of hours instead of the typical weeks or months required using traditional surveying tripod-mounted instruments and methodologies. Accurate land surveys are required for legal purposes and are essential for the planning and building of roads and commercial, residential and other government building projects.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s the holiday season! We have two consecutive short trading weeks on the way, with Christmas and New Years around the corner. I'm examining the historical data on how stocks tend to perform these weeks. Then I’m going to look at the actual Santa Claus Rally as it was officially defined. Finally, I’ll list some individual stocks to keep an eye on during the most wonderful time of the year. The table below summarizes weekly returns for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) over the past 50 years. Certain years, traders don’t get a day off for New Year’s so that’s why there’s less than 50 New Year’s weeks. Buyers seem to stick around on the holidays as these have been bullish weeks for stocks. The SPX averages a 0.55% return during the week of Christmas with 62% of the returns positive. New Year’s has done even better averaging a return of 0.66%. These holiday weeks easily beat the typical weekly return for the SPX of 0.17%. The general outperformance for stocks at the end of year is often casually referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. According to Investopedia, however, the term was first used in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, the founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. He defined the Santa Claus Rally as the first two trading days of the New Year along with the last five trading days of the previous year. So, let’s look at how these specific seven trading days have performed over the past 50 years. This has indeed been a bullish time. The S&P 500 has averaged a return of more than 1% with positive returns 74% of the time during these seven trading days. The typical 7-day return for the index was 0.26% with 58% of the returns positive. This next table lists the S&P 500 stocks which have performed the best during the Santa Claus Rally over the past 10 years (sorted by percent positive then average return). Newmont (NEM) tops the list averaging a return of more than 4% with 90% of the returns positive. I see a few real estate names and healthcare companies, but no sector is dominating the list. Finally, there have been stocks that underperform during this time. This next table shows the worst performing S&P 500 stocks during the Santa Claus Rally timeframe. CME Group (CME) tops this list, finishing positive just one time out of 10 during these seven trading days. Interestingly, some mega-cap stocks show up on this list including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL). A decent number of information technology companies have performed poorly showing up in the table below. Sign in to access your portfolio

Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother’s autopsy report. There it was, one devastating word: “accident.” The papers trembled in her hands. Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold’s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff’s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn’t breathing. How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide. Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner’s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight. “No more silence or complacency,” she thought. “No sweeping it under the rug.” In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died — what’s known as the manner and cause of death. On TV dramas such as “CSI” or “Bones,” facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren’t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police. Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP’s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use — even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted “excited delirium,” a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill. Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon. The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement. The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement. “I call it a crazy quilt,” said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners’ independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family’s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher. “I had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you’d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime — police officer or not,” Jen Dold said. “Sadly, we realized this was not the case.” Jen Dold — 11 years older than Alex — had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially. One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left. The county mental health department wouldn’t send someone, saying Dold wasn’t violent enough. When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment. Two Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door. Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold’s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied. Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report. Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill. “It was the worst yelling, shouting I’ve ever heard,” one neighbor told an investigator. After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes. Jen Dold didn’t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother’s mental illness, she thought to protect officers. Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County’s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he’d weigh police force. Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn’t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident. Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold’s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied — Selove used it even though under his own office’s policies intent “need not be present or proven” for a homicide ruling. For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn’t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it — and doing so has “some value” to reduce any appearance of a cover-up. Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization’s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court. The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force. Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother’s death accountable was a lawsuit. Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother’s death, Deputy McGee — the first one into Dold’s home — had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty. The county had settled that family’s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help. As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold’s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it. Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County. Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold’s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident. “I have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,” Adams said. “Why do you say it’s a homicide?” the lawyer asked. “Because when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn’t matter about the intent,” Adams replied. The family hugged. “We just kept saying, ‘Did he really just say that? Did he really just say ‘homicide'?” Jen Dold recalled. Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn’t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove’s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a “danger to public health and safety.” In an interview, Selove said Adams’ homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn’t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him. The county offered Dold’s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn’t budge. She finally relented. “The process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,” she said. When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold’s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records. In the seven years since her brother’s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe. A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner’s report was different by just one word — homicide? While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials — the police chief or sheriff, the mayor — as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers. In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger. Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting. Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, “I think they George Floyded him.” The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state’s chief medical examiner. Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers. “Great day!!” Brave wrote in one. “After our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.” He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as “superhuman strength” and high pain tolerance. Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what’s known as prone position — the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP’s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor. Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson’s death was due to methamphetamine-induced “psychomotor agitation” and “physical exertion with physical restraint.” The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined — one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide. Miller didn’t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn’t trying to influence her — he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages. Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy. In a 2018 “Managing Your Medical Examiner” web presentation, a longtime member of the company’s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. “Control the narrative” by getting the deceased’s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are “hostile,” line up police-friendly experts to counter them. Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not “infallible truth” but rather “driven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.” Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die “walking time bombs.” Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths. One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause. “Dangerously close to intimidation,” the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time. Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association’s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they “suffered consequences,” including being fired. In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be “independent from law enforcement and prosecutors,” and based on scientific evidence and research. Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes. Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show. After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state’s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith’s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification “wrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts … to baselessly vilify police officers.” The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he “was not pressuring anyone” but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages. In March 2019, an officer’s punch fractured a 54-year-old man’s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington’s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor. The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn’s death was tragic but the medical examiner’s report had “confusing and contradictory findings.” Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont. An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement. State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas’ justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties. In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner’s office. The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be. The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field. Briones survived the wreck — but not the night. Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn’t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment. By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late. Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently. The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths — typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system. Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner’s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner’s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide. In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that — at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches — Briones was “morbidly obese.” He ruled the death natural. The Briones family couldn’t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn’t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment. San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP’s database and ruled none a homicide. In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP’s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later — in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake’s death a homicide attributable to tasing. All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County’s four deaths was. Miami’s chief medical examiner declined to comment. The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner’s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother’s death. ___ Weiss reported from Greenville, South Carolina; Mohr reported from Jackson, Mississippi; Dunklin reported from Dallas; Pritchard reported from Los Angeles and Kirkland, Washington.

Title: Accident or homicide? Medical rulings in arrest-related deaths can dictate what happens to police

Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother’s autopsy report. There it was, one devastating word: “accident.” The papers trembled in her hands. Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold’s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff’s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn’t breathing. How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide. Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner’s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight. “No more silence or complacency,” she thought. “No sweeping it under the rug.” In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died — what’s known as the manner and cause of death. On TV dramas such as “CSI” or “Bones,” facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren’t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police. Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP’s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use — even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted “excited delirium,” a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill. Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon. The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement. The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement. “I call it a crazy quilt,” said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners’ independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family’s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher. “I had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you’d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime — police officer or not,” Jen Dold said. “Sadly, we realized this was not the case.” Jen Dold — 11 years older than Alex — had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially. One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left. The county mental health department wouldn’t send someone, saying Dold wasn’t violent enough. When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment. Two Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door. Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold’s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied. Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report. Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill. “It was the worst yelling, shouting I’ve ever heard,” one neighbor told an investigator. After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk.

In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner’s office. The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be. The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field. Briones survived the wreck — but not the night. Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn’t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment. By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late. Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently. The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths — typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system. Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner’s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner’s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide. In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that — at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches — Briones was “morbidly obese.” He ruled the death natural. The Briones family couldn’t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn’t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment. San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP’s database and ruled none a homicide. In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP’s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later — in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake’s death a homicide attributable to tasing. All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County’s four deaths was. Miami’s chief medical examiner declined to comment. The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner’s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother’s death. ___ Weiss reported from Greenville, South Carolina; Mohr reported from Jackson, Mississippi; Dunklin reported from Dallas; Pritchard reported from Los Angeles and Kirkland, Washington.

Title: Big Tech is dominating the market once again — and that's probably just fine: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings December is shaping up to be a tale of two markets. On the one hand, the Dow (^DJI) just suffered its worst day in a month, capping a nine-day losing streak — its longest since 1978. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) notched six record highs this month, including one on Monday. Investors can thank the $1.2 trillion worth of value that was added this month to the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA). Since the election, their market capitalization has surged by $1.8 trillion, led by Tesla's stunning $680 billion gain. Even more remarkable: This rally comes despite Nvidia shedding $200 billion over the same period. But investor concerns about the narrowing rally are nothing new. Since this bull market began two years ago, the S&P 500 has tacked on $22 trillion in market capitalization, of which the Mag Seven stocks have contributed a cool $10 trillion, or 45%. Each time the Mag Seven shows its dominance in the market, headlines trumpet comparisons to the late 1990s dot-com bubble, implying doom. But each time in this rally, other areas of the market have picked up and asserted themselves — while the tech stocks themselves have continued to do well. Even when the Mag Seven index itself fell into a bear market in July, the damage to the S&P 500 was limited to a 9% drop. At the time, utilities, real estate, and consumer staples cushioned the fall — a classic case of "defensive" sectors earning their moniker. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, is fond of saying, "Rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets." But when massive amounts of cash on the sidelines are being tapped, that can indicate Keynes's animal spirits at work. And BofA just reported the biggest drop in cash allocation since April 2001, a sign of "super-bullish sentiment." Amid the uber-risk-on sentiment, cash is disappearing from portfolios at a record pace. The latest reading shows the allocation to cash by fund managers dropping to net 14% underweight — the lowest level since at least 2011 and the sharpest decline in five years. And that level of sentiment is the proverbial fly in the ointment. BofA ominously highlights prior periods when cash allocation dropped to a similar degree: the first quarter of 2002, in the midst of a nasty bear market that would wipe 50% off the S&P 500, and February 2011, just prior to a near-20% drop in the index. As the analysts wrote, "previous lows in cash allocation coincided with big tops in risk assets."

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell chip could push the company into a new stratosphere as the AI revolution continues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

Title: Netflix Stock: What’s In Store For 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/18/netflix-stock-whats-in-store-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-18T10:00:29Z
Full Content:
Netflix logo displayed on a phone screen is seen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on ... [+] December 15, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Netflix stock has had a solid year, rising by almost 90% year-to-date, trading at about $920 per share currently. This compares to rival Disney, which has gained about 26% over the same period. Growth has been driven by Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming plan. These moves have helped the company boost subscriber adds, with over 22 million users signing up over the first nine months of the year, bringing its user base to about 283 million subscribers. So what does 2025 hold for Netflix stock? As an aside, also check out Is Pfizer Stock Undervalued? Netflix’s growth in 2024 was driven by its measures to curb password sharing, which required users to either pay for additional sharing options or create new accounts. This initiative has now been rolled out across 100+ countries helping Netflix sign on more subscribers, or better monetize existing users. Similarly, the ad-supported tier, which offers a more affordable entry point for users, has seen strong adoption, with over half of new subscribers in eligible regions opting for this plan as of the most recent quarter. That being said, with the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported plans now largely rolled out in key markets, Netflix may have limited avenues for significant subscriber growth in the near term. These initiatives quite likely pulled forward demand from future years, and this could mean that 2025 could see somewhat muted subscriber growth from Netflix. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 could be a sign that the company expects growth to plateau. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Netflix recently raised pricing on its Basic and Premium plans by $2 per month and $3 per month, respectively. However, Netflix’s lowest-priced ad-supported plan and its Standard full-HD plan, which are likely two of the company’s most popular options, remained at $7 and $15.50 per month, respectively. In fact, the last time Netflix increased prices on its full-HD plan was in January 2022, meaning it’s almost three years now. This could mean that a price hike may be around the corner in 2025 for these two plan options as Netflix looks to offset higher content spending. Moreover, with users now used to Netflix’s other big changes that Netflix has carried out, such as paid sharing, the company could potentially raise prices without much pushback from customers. That being said, the competition is mounting and this could reduce the magnitude of Netflix’s potential price hikes. For example, Disney’s streaming bundles, offering Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for as low as $15 per month, appear to provide stronger value. Netflix’s margins have expanded significantly, standing at about 30% in Q3 2024, up from about 22% in the year-ago period driven by higher per-user revenues, led by price hikes and the ad-supported plans, besides a moderation in content investments last year through the writers’ strike. Margins could hold up in 2025 as Netflix continues to expand its revenue base. However, there are some concerns as well. Content costs are set to rise as Netflix forays into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling. Additionally, rising competition could lead to higher churn rates or a slowdown in new sign-ups and this could also reflect on margins to an extent. See our Netflix downside scenario Netflix Stock Downside Scenario: $400 Netflix stock has seen considerable volatility in the past. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is Netflix stock attractive at current levels? At the current stock price of almost $920 per share, Netflix trades at around 40x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears expensive in our view. In comparison, the stock was trading at about 20x earnings back in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent performance has been strong, markets tend to be short-sighted, extrapolating short-term successes for the long run. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong streak of subscriber additions and likely grow revenues comfortably at double-digits. However, there’s a real possibility that Netflix will soon see subscriber growth cool, as the twin benefit of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize. We value Netflix stock at about $613 per share, about 33% below the market price. See our analysis of Netflix valuation: Expensive or Cheap?

Title: Swiss fintech startup tiun raises $2.5 million to modernise media monetision

tiun, a fintech helping media providers to attract, engage and convert younger audiences, is today announcing a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful. The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. 0 18 December 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure.The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users, and increase customer spending and engagement.Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.”tiun enters the market at a time the news media industry is in financial freefall. A lack of revenue is causing significant layoffs throughout the industry. Estimates by the Press Gazette suggest that 2,500 media jobs have been cut in the US and UK this year alone. Big-name takeovers in the US haven’t yet solved the problem, either. Over the past decade, Jeff Bezos, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, and Marc Benioff bought The Washington Post, LA Times, and Time Magazine, respectively. Despite their backing, those three publications alone lost an estimated $150 million in 2023. tiun builds the infrastructure that allows younger audiences to connect their wallet with an online service in a few clicks to access and pay for media, allowing them to pay for the time they consume. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, "The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure.The tiun infrastructure can track activity and end the session if there is no movement after a given time, preventing users from overspending. To incentivize uptake, tiun limits the amount media providers can charge users to a maximum of 20% of what a monthly subscription would cost. Once those limits are reached, the remainder of the month is free. The data and insights gathered by the platform can be used to inform media strategies to ensure media is as engaging as possible. Bertie Highmore, Head of Investments at Blue Wire Capital says, “The tiun team have extensive experience in - and demonstrated ability for - building, launching and scaling digital platforms. Strong appetite has already been shown for their product, which solves one of the biggest emerging issues in online media. We’re excited to be on board, and are looking forward to what will be a huge next twelve months for them.”The tiun team is delighted to raise its initial funding round to develop a first-of-its-kind solution to modernize the way online media providers charge for their services. The team will share a series of exciting updates in the coming year.

Title: The Game Awards' first Game Changers recipient responds to "hateful" and "disturbing" comments accusing him of fraud

"This is the 'reward' for two years of service." Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife. Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host Geoff Keighley's way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way". Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent. "Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a LinkedIn post. "People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement." Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote. However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate. "I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments." He has also never laid employees off. "They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said. "I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know." He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service." Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service". Astro Bot won multiple awards on the night, including Game of the Year, as did Balatro and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji posted a long comment on his disappointment at the game not winning the top prize, despite taking home Best Action Game and the Players' Voice award.

Title: Wishes, love, and reshuffling (afterwards): The Arrival of Pavlos and the… royal matters, the forgotten bank amendment, Viva’s battle in London
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2024/12/18/wishes-love-and-reshuffling-afterwards-the-arrival-of-pavlos-and-the-royal-matters-the-forgotten-bank-amendment-vivas-battle-in-london/
Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:33:06Z
Full Content:
Hello! So, a few days ago, I wrote to you about the Christmas spirit making its timely appearance (right on cue as we approach the holidays…). It has been felt in political life, suddenly in the media (let’s see how long that lasts), and, as of yesterday, among the MPs of New Democracy. The meeting of K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) with them went very well—smiles, selfies, and casual chit-chat about this and that (a little Lebanon, a little Syria, a little Recovery Fund)—and we’re all one big happy family, waiting for:a) The selection of a President of the Republic (that we all need to vote for), andb) The subsequent cabinet reshuffle, in which it’s hoped that around 7-10 MPs will be promoted to deputy ministers, and maybe even ministers, replacing some of the non-parliamentary ministers currently holding office but not contributing much. And the Reshuffle?So, now you might ask, what kind of reshuffle is this going to be? Well, the answer is that I could list everything I’ve heard, you could read it, and then recycle it over festive dinner conversations—but that doesn’t mean Mitsotakis will necessarily follow through with it. Honestly, I think the thread of the reshuffle starts with Gerapetritis and whether K.M. will bring him back to the Maximos Mansion (the Prime Minister’s office) or not. One source tells me that Gerapetritis himself is very keen on returning to his old position, which of course matters. If that happens, there’s one scenario in which Hatzidakis moves to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pierrakakis to the Ministry of Economy, and Christos Dimas to Education, etc., etc. But let me tell you, I personally wouldn’t hold my breath for such predictions. Columns like this are meant to feature such entertaining reports—or “reports”—that often turn out to be baseless chatter and are far from official government gazettes. The Arrival of PavlosA major stir was caused by yesterday’s revelation that Pavlos (the eldest son of the former King of Greece) has decided to apply for Greek citizenship—a development that constitutes… a great victory for Democracy, considering that he will finally acquire a last name. I’d argue that this is a collective national fixation we’ve failed to resolve for 50 years—unlike every other civilized Western country. As of yesterday, the firstborn son of the former King is in Athens, and it’s not unlikely that he’ll head to the Athens Registry Office with Nikolaos, as it seems acquiring citizenship is a family decision. What Pavlos hasn’t shared with his interlocutors, however, is which surname he has chosen, as this is a prerequisite for identification along with recognition of the Constitution, the form of government, and the 1974 Referendum decision. The entire family will have to file similar applications, and any grandchildren born after citizenship is acquired will automatically inherit it. Pavlos’s Last NameA reliable source tells me that the surname Pavlos has chosen for his family is “Di Grecia,” as it appears on the Danish passports held by members of the former royal family. Of course, when asked about this, Pavlos offers “no comment,” avoiding delving into the issue while not denying the information either. The Banks and the FalloutThe greatest loss for the banks from the recent measures isn’t financial—though it’s not negligible—it’s the communication storm they faced from the political leadership and the press. This has tarnished the industry’s image in a way that cannot be immediately repaired. To be fair, the €100 million for the property entity, as well as the €100 million for schools, had already been put on the table by the banks. Another issue they raised was related to the procedures for the “My Home” program. Specifically, on July 5, 2023, the banks proposed to the government that the engineering certificate requirement be waived for applicants seeking to purchase apartments under the “My Home” program. They even submitted two alternative amendment drafts for this waiver, which would apply only to program beneficiaries. The proposal was made because the banks had identified that “My Home” required contract signings to be completed within 6 to 8 months of eligibility approval—a timeframe often insufficient for property legalizations due to bureaucracy. The Battle for Viva Continues in LondonThe legal battle between WeRealize (WRL), owned by Haris Karonis and Makis Antypas, and JP Morgan over Viva continues unabated. The two shareholders of the Greek fintech filed an appeal against the London High Court’s June ruling on the fair valuation of the company. According to the legal-focused Law360, both sides took issue with aspects of the initial decision. The appeal hearings began on Monday in London, where JP Morgan’s legal team (Freshfields law firm) argued that Viva’s valuation should not include a future U.S. expansion plan. Meanwhile, WRL’s lawyers (from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan) claimed that JP Morgan has blocked Viva’s U.S. entry and hindered updates to its business plan, which would significantly boost the fintech’s valuation. The dispute centers on Viva’s valuation and which financial figures independent appraisers should use to determine its fair value in a potential sale, as well as the weight of the current business plan. It was revealed in court that any changes to Viva’s business plan require the consent of both shareholders. WRL argued that JP Morgan vetoed any modifications to the plan. The clash essentially revolves around the terms of the call option as part of JP Morgan’s acquisition of 48.5% of Viva, announced in 2022, which valued the fintech at €1.7 billion. According to disclosed terms, WRL forfeits its right to reject any Viva acquisition by JP Morgan if Viva’s valuation falls below €5 billion by the end of the fourth call option period in July 2025. The hearings continue. Signatures for the VOAK before the end of Q1 2025 Demanding procedures and a tight timeline are in place for the implementation of the major concession project Chania-Heraklion, which will become the most complex closed highway constructed in Greece in the coming years. The Northern Road Axis of Crete (VOAK) took center stage recently, as it was the focus of discussions during meetings between the Prime Minister and the political leadership of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in Crete. According to the latest plans, the contractual documents for the Chania-Heraklion section are nearing completion and are expected to be finalized by the end of January. At this stage, the provisional contractor, GEK TERNA, is submitting the necessary information to secure its designation as the final bidder. The relevant documents have already been sent to the European Commission for Competition to provide an opinion on the project, and it is estimated that the contract will not be signed before the end of Q1 2025. Industry insiders describe VOAK as a highly challenging project due to the lack of studies and the need for a new route design to address construction difficulties and local opposition. This complexity is one of the reasons why construction companies (GEK TERNA, AKTOR, and METKA) have reached an agreement on managing the project and dividing their shares in both construction and the concession. This agreement is expected to be formalized after the contract signing, meaning after April 2025. It should be noted that both GEK TERNA, which is currently the provisional bidder, and METKA have been part of the project concession from the beginning of the tender, which is expected to exceed €2 billion. AKTOR entered the game later, following its acquisition by the administration of A. Exarchou. Public Proposal Today marks the final deadline set by law for mandatory public offers. Consequently, the informational memorandum by Masdar for TERNA ENERGY is expected to be submitted to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission. Interest from… India… for co-production at HDS At Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), beyond the matter of the consortium with the Czech group CSG (for which a decision by the Council of State on the injunctive measures is expected any day now), there is considerable activity. Recently, major business groups from… India have expressed interest in producing ammunition at HDS that could be sold in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. This interest was demonstrated both during a visit by Indian entrepreneurs to Athens 20 days ago and in a meeting between prominent Indian businessmen and the Prime Minister at the Greek ambassador’s residence in London in early December. Moreover, HDS is currently receiving interest in other projects as well, such as the maintenance of Patriot missiles and participation in the IRIS-T missile program, which will expand with new orders worth an additional €50 million. ADMIE and Google The recent, sudden announcement by ADMIE that it has reached an agreement with Serverfarm, a leading data center management company, to create the Gemini joint venture aimed at developing and operating hyperscale-ready data centers in Greece (up to 130MW), now has its explanation. It seems that ADMIE has secured its first major “hyperscale-ready” client for this data center, rumored in the market to be Google. Having already completed 15 years of presence in Greece, Google is ramping up its investments in the country, particularly in the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence sectors. The demand from the private sector for such services is increasing, while the government has also agreed to integrate AI into public services and sectors such as Civil Protection and Health. Meanwhile, ADMIE’s stock is soaring to unprecedented levels, with a market capitalization of €585 million and a price of €2.5, representing an 18.6% increase compared to six months ago. EYDAP is Planning (and Staying Quiet About It) Not a single word escaped the lips of EYDAP’s management yesterday regarding the highly anticipated—and nearly obligatory—placement of shares into institutional portfolios. This move is aimed at ensuring the necessary dispersion of ownership as well as boosting liquidity ahead of the company’s very large and ambitious investment plans. EYDAP’s top priority is to ensure that Athens does not run out of water, which is why it is rushing to finalize the details of connecting the Kremasta Lake with the reservoirs of Evinos and Mornos. Completing this project will require at least two years. Desalination, while considered an expensive (three times the cost) and often ineffective process by EYDAP’s management, could still be used in areas like Thisvi, Aspraspitia, or Itea, where infrastructure and industrial facilities already exist. For the water supply needs of the Hellinikon project, EYDAP plans to follow the successful model used on Aegina. Major parks, such as “Tritsis” and “Hellinikon,” will be irrigated using recycled water, which, however, requires a specialized network. Awaiting the Three Witches of Friday and… Santa Claus Just seven trading sessions remain until the end of this year’s stock market season, and the General Index is just over 3% away from reaching the psychological target of 1,500 points, spurred by the traditional “Santa Claus rally.” On the flip side, without genuine buying interest, most market moves are aimed at “locking in” profits and polishing up the valuations of professional portfolios. Banks continue to offer no support to the General Index, and yesterday other heavyweight stocks faced selling pressure as investors liquidated to increase their cash reserves ahead of the new year. This Friday marks the expiration of derivative contracts across stocks, indices, and commodities, which is why everyone is talking about December’s “triple witching.” Additionally, the FTSE index rebalancing will be finalized, with Autohellas departing after celebrating its transition with a +1.74% gain yesterday. The General Index closed at 1,452.8 points yesterday, losing -0.8%, with a trading volume of €122.14 million, of which just €7.2 million came from block trades. Banks are not seeing strong buying interest, but neither are they facing aggressive sell-offs. OTE, PPC, OPAP, and Jumbo saw losses exceeding 2% yesterday, driven by investment strategies. TITAN (+1.41%) at €39.45 was the only stock managing to offset the weight on the General Index, albeit modestly. How Likely is a Global Debt Crisis Today? Most economists today estimate that the probability of a serious global debt crisis over the next three years does not exceed 30%. Is this figure reassuring? Perhaps. The fact remains that, since we avoided a major debt crisis over the past two years—when public debt skyrocketed (in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic) and central banks dramatically raised interest rates to combat hyperinflation—the likelihood of a global debt crisis is now receding as things calm down. However, there are causes for concern. China, with total public and private debt at 290% of GDP (and half of its population on the brink of poverty), poses a significant risk. Still, China’s debt is almost entirely domestic, denominated in yuan. With inflation under control, its central bank could leverage its balance sheet to buy bonds and stave off a debt crisis if necessary. In the U.S., the fiscal deficit has reached $1.8 trillion in 2024 (6.4% of GDP), with official interest expenses exceeding $1 trillion annually. The spark for a global public debt wildfire could ignite in one of the emerging economies prone to fiscal mismanagement. Finally, serious problems may lurk in the “less transparent” corners of global debt and derivatives markets. There, we can only hope that the lesson of Lehman Brothers has been learned. From France to Germany: Disappointment Continues Germany is far from forming a functional government, and this is already reflected in its business confidence indices. The well-known Ifo Business Index dropped to 84.7 in December, down from 85.6 in November. This is the lowest level for the Ifo since May 2020, significantly below the long-term average of 96.6, with disappointment visible even when compared to recent years. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the index has averaged just 88.2. The plunge in the Ifo Index is attributed to a sharp drop in expectations, which fell from 87 in November to 84.4 in December. The Lonely Party of the “Magnificent Seven” The Magnificent Seven was a classic 1960s Western directed by John Sturges, depicting the gritty journey of seven gunfighters in the Wild West. In today’s glamorous world of Wall Street, the term “Magnificent Seven” has been repurposed by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the seven tech giants: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla—which, while not just an automaker, is now regarded as a high-tech company. These seven stocks are currently worth over $18 trillion. They have recorded gains of around 50% since the beginning of the year, compared to the 20% gains of the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 and the index’s overall +28% increase. This is happening while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recorded its ninth consecutive losing session as of late last night, marking the longest downward streak since 1978.

These 11 economists, strategists, and analysts made prescient calls that defined financial markets in 2024 In many ways, market trends in 2024 seemed like a continuation of those in 2023. The US economy remained on its path to a soft landing. Artificial intelligence companies retained their dominance and repeatedly beat earnings. And it increasingly looks like the S&P 500 is due to post another year of 20%+ returns. But that doesn't mean there weren't new developments in various corners of the market, or that these trends were particularly easy to predict. That's where Business Insider's 2024 Oracles of Wall Street list comes in, highlighting strategists, analysts, and economists who were on the money with their calls this year. Selections were made based on internal and external nominations, and those whose calls were both accurate and against consensus at the time were given the most weight. The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but it aims to lift some of the most impressive calls recently for some of the biggest trends in markets this year. Below, we break down how each selectee made their calls and share their top forecasts for 2025. The S&P 500 has continued on its torrid pace in 2024, posting 27% gains so far in 2024. Investors have cheered on rate cuts, artificial intelligence investment, economic stability, and Trump's election victory, lifting the index beyond most expectations. As the index sits just below 6,100, some strategists were closer than most with their predictions. Last December, the median 2024 year-end price target among top Wall Street strategists was just 4,500, according to Bloomberg data. In December 2023, DeGraaf said the S&P 500 could hit 5,800 in the year ahead based on a few pieces of evidence he saw. His proprietary cycle clock indicator, which considers inflation and growth trends, was bullish based on the premise that inflation was expected to stay cool while growth would be moderate enough to induce monetary stimulus. On top of that, investor sentiment was below where it should have been for how the market was performing in 2023, he thought. "Sentiment was ridiculously bearish for the kind of year we were having," DeGraaf said. "That's usually bullish. We call it the skeptical advance." His also-proprietary "thrust" indicator, which considers market momentum gauges, showed a 22% return over the following 12 months as the average outcome given momentum conditions at the time. "We just said, 'Look, this combination of things taking place certainly look bullish," he said. Next year, DeGraaf sees the S&P 500 delivering returns closer to 15%, a bit lower than the 28% gains so far in 2024. "We still like what we see," he said. Back in March, Bartels also predicted that the S&P 500 would rise to 5,800 by the end of the year. Bartels has been bullish since the stock market bottomed out in late 2022. Even when the market saw minor pullbacks in 2024, she pointed to strong corporate earnings and the continued leadership of the technology sector as tailwinds propelling stocks higher. With the index now north of 6,000, that optimism has proven correct. In particular, Bartels strongly believes that AI can transform the economy to the same extent as previous innovations, such as the personal computer. Similar to the early days of the tech boom in the late 1990s, Bartels believes many strategists don't know how to fully price in the impact of AI. "I think people are underestimating the improvement in productivity from AI," Bartels told Business Insider. "Productivity will continue to improve just like we saw from 1995 to 2000." Bartels is confident that the S&P 500 will continue to smash expectations in 2025. She's predicting the index ends next year at 7,200 to 7,400, and she doesn't expect the bull run to fizzle out beyond next year, either — Bartels believes that the S&P 500 could go as high as 10,000 by the end of the decade thanks to pro-business legislation, lower interest rates, and AI. Richey was another strategist who saw the S&P 500 climbing well above consensus. Building on Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye's bullish fundamental outlook, Richey compiled the technical indicators he watches and concluded in February that the index could hit 6,000 by the end of 2024. For example, the S&P 500's relative strength index, which measures price momentum, had stayed in "overbought" territory for three weeks at the time. When that has happened in the past, it's meant that the trend could continue for several months, Richey said. Investor sentiment was also bullish but not over-extended. And the yield curve was still inverted despite no sign of recession. "Some of the biggest gains in the bull market — statistically, it's measurable that they occur during yield curve inversions such as the late '90s and 2006-2007," he said. Going into 2025, however, Richey sees signs that the rally could face hurdles if a negative catalyst comes along. "Looking ahead, the collection of market indicators and cyclical signals we monitor suggest all the pieces are in place for this bull market to end in the weeks or months ahead and for a cyclical bear market to begin," Richey said in an email. But he added that: "There is nothing in the current fundamental backdrop that suggests a bear market in stocks is a sure thing or even likely for that matter." As we start to approach the midpoint of the 2020s, it's becoming increasingly clear that the US economy is in another "Roaring '20s" era a century after the first. Fiscal and monetary stimulus have fueled an extremely robust economic recovery following the pandemic, and artificial intelligence is expected boost profit margins and productivity. One strategist first called this a few years ago, and stuck with it even as recession fears swirled: In late 2021, Draho said in a client note titled "Rose Colored Glasses" that the US economy would enjoy a strong decade ahead. And even as recession fears became consensus in the market in 2022, he stuck with his call, arguing that government spending, artificial intelligence investment, and other factors would boost economic growth and create another "Roaring '20s" era. Three years later, Draho's prediction is well on its way to coming true. The economy has survived a bout of inflation and subsequent Federal Reserve rate hikes, multiple spending packages have been signed into law, and AI has disrupted the market landscape in full force. In 2025, Draho thinks GDP growth will remain higher than 2%, and the S&P 500 will climb to 6,600. "The way things have been trending, it's quite possible that by early 2025 only the most pessimistic investors will need rose-colored glasses to see a clear path to a Roaring '20s outcome," Draho wrote in a September 30 note. The first 50 basis-point cut in 16 years was one of the year's big surprises. Even after the call temporarily became consensus in August, the move at the September FOMC meeting still came unexpectedly to most. But at least a couple of economists stuck to their guns. Many in the market pushed back on Feroli's prediction that the Fed would start off its easing cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September. Other experts argued that such a cut would send the markets into panic by signaling that the economy was in a bad place. However, Feroli, who previously served as an economist at the Fed, believed that a more significant reduction in interest rates would be necessary to strengthen the labor market — and that the Fed would prioritize economic policy over the optics of a 50 basis point cut. Feroli thought the Fed should have started cutting in July, so a larger rate cut in September was one way to help the Fed catch up on its quest to bring interest rates into less restrictive territory. Going forward, Feroli believes 2025 could very well be an uneventful year for both growth and inflation. Trump's reelection means that there's already a playbook for investors of how things went down the first time, he said. However, a change in the White House is still bound to introduce some unknowns to the economy, especially regarding potentially inflationary policy proposals like tariffs and tax cuts, which is why Feroli believes the Fed will cut at a less aggressive pace next year. Feroli doesn't see any more jumbo-sized cuts in the future, and expects a 25 basis point cut in December. Dutta was another economist that stayed with his 50 basis point cut call for the September Fed meeting. He first argued that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points in August, when the Sahm Rule unemployment recession indicator triggered. That quickly became the consensus, but that view quickly faded in favor of a 25 basis point cut after August's inflation data showed continued cooling in price growth. Dutta, however, kept with his call. "The case for 50 is strong, so we are sticking with it," he wrote in a September 15 note. "Powell is more cautious than his counterparts. The most memorable line from his August 23 Jackson Hole speech was, 'We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.' Since then, labor market data has surprised uniformly to the downside." For 2025, Dutta said his highest-conviction view is that investors are overestimating the amount of fiscal stimulus that Congress will approve. "I think the most you can really expect is an extension of the tax law," he said. "Because it's a very thin majority in the House, it's going to be very, very challenging to ram things through." While investors expected rate cuts in 2024, most thought they would come much sooner than they did. A couple of experts, however, argued late last year that the market wasn't appreciating the degree to which the Fed was going to have to put off slashing their benchmark rate as the economy continually proved resilient. This time last year, the market was pricing in a near-0% chance that interest rates would still be above 5% in July 2024, with the expectation that the Fed would begin cutting rates as soon as March 2024. At the time, the federal funds rate was 5.25%-5.5%. But Osmani didn't agree with the overwhelming consensus. Instead, he said in November 2023 that the Fed wouldn't start cutting rates until the second half of 2024. Osmani based his call on the view that central banks would fail to reach their inflation targets. Specifically, wage inflation would continue to be an issue as consumers sought pay raises to keep up with rising prices, further fuelling stickier-than-expected inflation. When July came around, the fed funds rate had remained unchanged from the start of the year, proving Osmani's outlook correct. Looking towards 2025, Osmani believes that inflationary pressures will increase thanks to the impact of tariffs on top of already elevated wage inflation levels. As a result, expect the Fed to behave like a "hawkish dove," he said, meaning that while the Fed won't reverse course on rate cuts, it'll slow the pace of easing. Colmar was also in this camp, defying overwhelming market consensus that the Fed was poised to slash rates early in the year. He argued in January this year that the economy didn't need rate cuts, and that the Fed signaling them would essentially lead to a scenario where financial conditions eased on bullish sentiment, making inflation stickier, further hindering their leeway to cut. Realizing this, the Fed would then need to push rate cuts out as it sought to justify them, he said. Colmar said the Fed would end up cutting by 50-75 basis points in 2024. The central bank has cut by 75 basis points so far, and is expected to drop them again in December, but the market at the time was pricing in more than an 85% chance that rates would be even lower by the end of 2024. Plus, rate cuts have come far later than the market originally expected. "Our view was that interest rates weren't restrictive. Powell had just said that it was very restrictive, and we need to cut rates to bring it back down to equilibrium not to put us into recession. The market seemed to buy into that, and we said, 'No, no, no, he's got it wrong.'" In 2025, Colmar said he sees inflation hovering around 3%, above the Fed's 2% target. After lagging the S&P 500 for the first half of the year, small-cap stocks kicked off a furious rally in July as investors saw rate cuts on the horizon. Small-caps' sudden jump in anticipation of lower borrowing rates and an economic acceleration was one of the biggest moves in the market in 2024. Jonathan Golub saw it coming. The UBS strategist published a client note titled "Small Caps to Outperform Over Near Term" on June 18, and the sector surged just weeks later, with the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (VB) rising 8.5% from July 9-July 15, and 17% in the second half of the year. "Over the past year, Small Cap stocks have outperformed when Treasury yields have declined, and underperformed as they've risen. When this relationship has become disconnected, it has quickly reverted," Golub wrote in June. "Since May 30, Large Caps have outperformed by 6.2% despite falling interest rates, a much larger disconnect than the one experienced earlier in the year. This represents the potential for mid- to high-single-digit Small Cap outperformance over the near term." Heading into 2025, Golub argues in a recent client note that currently high stock valuations are justified. He has overweight ratings on the financials, Industrials, technology, and utilities sectors. Nvidia had an incredible year in 2023, and its share price only flew higher in 2024, rising 180% thanks to impressive earnings beats amid strong demand for its graphics processing unit products. In December of last year, Nvidia was Ramsay's top chip stock pick for 2024. The stock had already appreciated 220% to a price of around $500, and Ramsay was confident that it had another 40% upside, giving it a price target of $700. One year later, Nvidia has broken record after record and Ramsay has repeatedly raised his target. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June, Ramsay set the chip giant's price target to $140, up from $120, by year-end. Nvidia's flagship GPU product is used by every leading cloud service provider and AI company — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and OpenAI — to train their large language models. "The suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments should allow for strong, sustained, above-peer growth across a widening set of verticals," Ramsay wrote in a June 9 client note. While Nvidia GPUs are most well known for their use in data centers, Ramsay also mentioned a promising up-and-coming business line: autonomous driving, which became a billion-dollar component of Nvidia's business at the end of fiscal year 2024. Other growing end markets for Nvidia chips include gaming, healthcare, and robotics. Nvidia has smashed analyst estimates every quarter this year, most recently posting $35 billion in revenues last month for fiscal year 2025 Q3. TD Cowen has now upped Nvidia's price target to $175 for the next 12 months, citing sustained customer demand for the company's new Blackwell chips, released in March of this year. Ramsay recently left TD Cowen, the firm said. The price of gold also went on a tear this year, beating the S&P 500 so far thanks partly to rate cuts and global central banks buying up the asset. In July of this year, Milling-Stanley saw a plethora of signs pointing to a rally in the price of gold. At the time, gold was trading at around $2,370 per ounce. Milling-Stanley set a target price of $2,700 by the end of the year, representing 14% further upside. Gold has historically performed well in times of economic uncertainty, and there was plenty of uncertainty in the markets this year. Impending rate cuts, US dollar depreciation, sticky inflation, and geopolitical conflicts all signaled an increased appetite for the yellow metal, as investors sought to put a bigger portion of their portfolio in what has historically been deemed a safe-haven asset. Additionally, central banks in emerging markets began upping their allocation to gold, leading to a spike in buying behavior. The price of gold hit an all-time high ahead of the election on October 30, closing at $2,788 an ounce. It's up 30% overall this year for a price of $2,721 per ounce, in line with Milling-Stanley's prediction. With the potential of several inflationary policies being implemented under Trump, Milling-Stanley doesn't see demand for gold going anywhere in the year ahead. Tariffs, tax cuts, and increased government spending are all inflationary policies that will heat up the economy and increase prices, he said. The increasing national debt will be another factor supporting the price of gold as the dollar weakens, Milling-Stanley said. He predicts an 80% probability for the price of gold to stay at current levels or go higher — potentially as high as $3,100 an ounce by the end of next year. Jump to

Title: Citi's annual review process is kicking off. Here's an inside look at its unpopular method.

Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:13:01Z

Citigroup welcomed 344 new managing directors earlier this month, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, the promotion process can be political and fraught, pitting employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told Business Insider. Citi evaluates employees on a forced curve, requiring managers to rank them from best to worst using a four-level scale with a certain percentage in each bucket. This system means there's a finite number of top ratings, so employees could exceed all the requirements of their role and still receive a middling grade, said the employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We are a company filled with hardworking, achievement-oriented colleagues and we embrace meritocracy," a Citi spokesperson told BI in a written statement. "Our process aims to ensure that colleagues across Citi are held to consistent standards and are assessed by those who have the most direct knowledge of their contributions." Over the years, the percentage ranges for each bracket have shifted slightly. A managing director said this year each business line could assign top ratings of 1 ("exemplary") and 2 ("exceeds expectations") to 5% to 10% and 15% to 30% of staff, respectively. The lion's share of employees — 50% to 65% — are labeled as "valued contributors." The remaining 3% to 7% who receive a 4 rating ("needs improvement") may face consequences such as being put on a performance improvement plan or losing bonus eligibility. "It creates an air of distrust inside of cultures and a lot of anxiety for employees that are high performers but may not be recognized for the work they do," John Frehse, a senior managing director at the management consultancy Ankura, said about the ranking practice. The same morning the new class of managing directors was announced, Citi held a virtual town hall for employees. During the Q&A session, human resources addressed an employee's written question that noted the forced distribution system could be unfair to small, high-performing teams. Sara Wechter, Citi's head of human resources, replied that there was no forced bell curve. A senior Citi executive familiar with the process told BI that Citi's curve is not forced as it uses brackets rather than fixed percentages. "We have guidelines associated with ratings, which is different from a forced curve," he said. That reasoning is of little comfort to employees BI spoke to who assign those ratings. "They are playing with words," said a managing director in the wealth division. "We were mandated to strictly follow the prescribed curve." This season's annual reviews, which began last week, play a key role in bonus allocations and promotions, including to managing director. They come at a tense time for Citi's workforce. As part of CEO Jane Fraser's mission to turn around the bank, Citi has laid off 7,000 employees and divested from several businesses. The overhaul isn't over, with the bank planning to cut 20,000 jobs from its workforce of more than 200,000 employees by 2026. Amid these changes, the managing director said there's more anxiety about the review process and uncertainty about bonuses. Grading on a forced curve is not unique to Citi. The practice, otherwise known as stack ranking, was popularized in the 1980s when General Electric's former CEO Jack Welch used it to cut bottom performers. However, this "rank and yank" tactic has fallen out of fashion with many major companies such as Microsoft and Amazon. Most banks engage in some form of stack ranking but the details differ, such as how strictly they adhere to a curve or the grading criteria they use. Morgan Stanley uses a five-point scale. Goldman Sachs has changed its system several times and, beginning in 2020, it's used a three-level system. "Good companies try to distinguish between the higher and lower performers and do that in terms of how people get raises, what their total compensation would be," said Anthony Nyberg, a professor of management at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. Citi employees receive two main ratings with each one graded on a curve, two ex-managing directors said. The two criteria are the "what," which measures an employee's results, such as revenue metrics, and the "how," which evaluates their approach and leadership abilities. This means employees get a combination score such as 1-2. While it is not a hard and fast rule, Citi employees are usually expected to earn top ratings for two to three consecutive years to receive a promotion, so the review process puts aspiring directors and managing directors under enormous pressure, three of the managing directors told BI. Direct managers submit their ratings for review before having a so-called "calibration" meeting with their fellow managers, the top manager of their business unit, and an HR representative, the two former executives said. At these meetings, direct managers review an employee's scores and make a case for why the employee deserves a coveted 1 or 2. After these calibration meetings, the top manager makes the final call on rankings. The outcome often disappoints managers and their reports, who may have never worked directly with the decision-maker, the managing directors said. The senior executive said that small teams of three or four employees can secure exemptions to the curve. As for large teams with high performers, he said there might be exceptions on a year-to-year basis but he wasn't aware of any ever happening. The evaluation process was described as contentious and stressful by the current and former managing directors, all of whom were responsible for rating employees. The calibration meetings were especially heated, with managers butting heads over which employees received the limited high ratings. Given the number of top rankings is fixed, managers were typically unwilling to budge on the 1s and 2s they were allotted, even if another manager argued they had more high performers. "No one was like, 'You can take mine,'" said one of the ex-managing directors, who left Citi this year. "We fought." The managers took issue with other aspects of the grading process. By implementing a curve on the team level, employees were sometimes compared to others with vastly disparate roles or responsibilities. Two of the ex-managing directors described some of the grading criteria as nebulous. For instance, they said, for employees with non-revenue-generating roles, the "what" score is effectively up to the manager's discretion. Frehse told BI that the biggest flaw with stacked ranking is that performance reviews are inherently subjective. "Stack ranking is inaccurate from the start," he said. "You're either only looking at the quantitative side, forgetting about the other side, or you're looking at both. And we know that the qualitative side is flawed and subjective." Frehse said that leaves room for employees to believe favoritism is at work. Three of the managing directors told BI that they believed internal politics played a role in how employees were ranked and which managers received top ratings for their direct reports. "When you use such a system, it tells you you can't trust different managers to be good managers," said one of the former managing directors. The senior executive said that the many calibration meetings he attended were productive. "It's just a way to get together, get out of the silos, and make sure that there's fairness and perspective that goes beyond your own team," he said. While he maintained that he had not seen hostile calibration meetings, he said that some conversations could get heated. "This is a very human thing when you have finite anything, and obviously we have finite compensation," he said. "Of course, people are aware of that, but I don't think it's a flaw in the design. I think that's just part of being human." At its best, stacked ranking should reduce anxiety among employees, Nyberg said. "People get very upset when things appear to be arbitrary, and the ranking system should actually reduce some of that as long as people can believe that you're doing those rankings in some sort of objective way," he said. However, it's hard for employees to trust the system if they lose trust in their employers, which often happens after layoffs, Nyberg said. "It's that contract between the organization and the employees starts to feel really violated that way, and then that permeates everything about it," he said, "then you wouldn't believe anything they say."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close-up of a laptop with a software engineer coding on the monitor. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based platform that offers monitoring and security solutions for applications and infrastructure. The company leverages AI to improve performance analysis, improve security management, and streamline workflows across cloud environments. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz upped his price target for Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to $170, up from $155, while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock as part of his outlook for the software sector in 2025. This adjustment reflects the broader trend of increasing valuations for several companies, driven by higher comparison multiples. Moskowitz noted: “DDOG remains a clear leader in the observability market, with multiple businesses at scale, and with potential tailwinds in the form of digital transformation, cloud migration, and GenAI.” The firm expressed a more optimistic view than many regarding cloud adoption in the coming years, mentioning both existing on-premise customers and new clients as key drivers. This was part of its detailed 2025 software sector outlook. Overall, DDOG ranks 6th on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DDOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DDOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite a subdued market along with 100% OFS, Vishal Mega Mart listing was in line with market expectation. I believe retail investors missed this opportunity wherein they had shown less interest in bidding. 33.33% premium over the issue price of ₹78 Listing is justified as we believe it was all because of reasonable valuations when compared to its listed peers and high focus towards catering to India’s growing middle- and lower-middle-income demographics which is strategically focused on underpenetrated markets. Considering volatility in the market sentiments and all other parameters, allotted conservative investors can think of booking profits today, while long term risk taking investors can consider the company to HOLD IT FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility & risk in the markets.

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s final policy meeting of 2024, expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut, will have implications beyond U.S. borders, particularly for emerging markets like India. The timing of this decision coincides with the leadership transition to President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. with likelihood of change in guard at US treasury also and for India a newly appointed Governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Key Highlights 1. FOMC Decision and Projections - The Fed’s anticipated rate cut signals its continued pivot to a more accommodative stance, aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy amidst easing inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainties. - Projections for 2025 will guide global markets in understanding the Fed’s long-term strategy, particularly with respect to managing growth and inflation. Geopolitical Context The Fed’s decisions are occurring against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical risks, including ongoing Middle Eastern tensions and a shift in U.S. presidential leadership. These factors may weigh heavily on the Fed’s forward guidance. Jerome Powell’s Outlook - Powell’s commentary will likely focus on the transition of monetary policy amidst evolving global risks. - Markets will scrutinize his assessment of recent inflation moderation, persistent geopolitical risks, and U.S. labor market dynamics. - His views on the Fed’s pivot from tightening to easing in 2024 will set the tone for future monetary policy under new leadership. Impact on the Indian Economy 1. Capital Flows and Currency Volatility - A Fed rate cut generally leads to a weakening of the U.S. dollar, potentially boosting capital inflows into emerging markets like India. - The rupee may benefit from reduced capital outflows, stabilizing against the dollar after recent volatility. 2. Trade and Export Dynamics - A weaker dollar could improve the competitiveness of Indian exports, particularly in sectors like IT services and pharmaceuticals, which benefit from a favorable exchange rate. - However, subdued global growth, as indicated by the Fed’s projections, could dampen overall demand for Indian exports. 3. Inflationary Pressures - Increased foreign inflows and a stable rupee could help ease imported inflation, particularly in oil and commodities, which are crucial for India’s economy. - A softer dollar may lead to lower crude oil prices, easing fiscal and current account pressures. 4. RBI Policy Response - The new RBI Governor is likely to align India’s monetary policy with global trends. - A Fed rate cut may prompt the RBI to maintain or even accelerate its accommodative stance to support domestic growth amidst declining inflation. - India’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) could consider a rate cut in early 2025 to maintain policy parity and stimulate domestic demand. Broader Implications for India 1. Stock Markets - Indian equity markets could see a boost as foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) look for higher returns in emerging markets amidst a softening U.S. dollar. - Rate-sensitive sectors such as banking, real estate, and infrastructure could particularly benefit from lower borrowing costs. 2. Geopolitical Sensitivity Geopolitical risks, including those influencing crude oil prices, remain a wildcard. Any escalation could offset the benefits of a weaker dollar. 3. Policy Continuity Under New RBI Leadership The incoming RBI Governor will need to strike a balance between supporting growth, anchoring inflation expectations, and managing global financial spillovers from the Fed’s easing cycle. Conclusion The Fed’s decision to cut rates will provide some relief to the Indian economy by improving liquidity conditions and stabilizing the rupee. However, the new RBI Governor will need to carefully navigate domestic and global headwinds, particularly with a focus on growth revival, fiscal discipline, and managing external shocks. Markets will closely watch how India aligns its monetary policy with evolving global dynamics in 2025.months “Moog Motion Controls Pvt Ltd (MMCPL), a subsidiary of Moog Inc, USA, was awarded a contract for supply of “Servo Hydraulic Actuator Loading System and Pneumatic Pressurisation System” on 27th November, 2021 for Rs. 10.94 crore against competitive bidding by following all the required commercial procedures,” it said.

Vishal Mega Mart IPO Vishal Mega Mart’s IPO saw a strong debut on the stock market with a 3.33% listing gain, opening at ₹104 compared to its issue price of ₹78. This positive momentum can be attributed to its strong subscription of 28.75 times, reflecting high investor demand. The company’s position as a leading offline retailer, consistent financial performance, and reasonable valuation resonated well with investors. However, given that this was a complete offer for sale (OFS), there are no direct benefits to the company, making it a play purely on market sentiment and its growth story in the retail sector. Investors are advised to book profits at this level, while those looking to hold should maintain a stop loss at around ₹95. MobiKwik IPO MobiKwik, the digital payment platform, delivered an impressive 57.71% listing gain, opening at ₹440 against an issue price of ₹279. The IPO had garnered a remarkable subscription of 125.69 times, indicating massive investor interest despite its high valuation and competitive fintech landscape. The company’s recent shift to profitability, coupled with the growing adoption of digital payments, boosted market confidence. However, sustaining this momentum would depend on its ability to maintain profitability and carve out a niche in the competitive fintech sector. Investors are recommended to book profits given the high listing gains, while those wanting to hold should set a stop loss at around ₹400. Sai Life Sciences IPO Sai Life Sciences, a player in the small-molecule drug development and manufacturing space, saw a moderate 18.40% listing gain, debuting at ₹650 compared to its issue price of ₹549. The IPO was subscribed 10.27 times, showing decent investor interest despite concerns about its overvaluation and high OFS proportion. While the company’s positive financial performance and rising profitability are encouraging, the limited direct benefits from the IPO proceeds may lead to cautious investor sentiment in the long term. It is advisable to book profits at this level, but for those wishing to hold, a stop loss at around ₹585. Nifty 50, the benchmark index, opened today’s session lower at 24,298 versus yesterday’s close of 24,336. It is now at 24,250, down 0.3 per cent.

Title: After being honored at The Game Awards for helping laid-off devs, Amir Satvat says he's received 'countless' hateful messages: 'This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry'

The first Game Changers award winner says "disturbing" comments about him and his family have followed his acceptance speech. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amir Satvat, the recipient of the first "Game Changers" award at this year's Game Awards, says he's received "countless hateful messages" as well as "disturbing comments" following his acceptance of the award last week, including antisemitic remarks about his wife. "I am continuing to do my best to tune this out but it is quite extreme," Satvat said in a LinkedIn post. During the event, Geoff Keighley admitted that he's "struggled" to know how best to address the unprecedented rash of games industry layoffs we've seen over the past few years. It was the first time the host and producer directly addressed layoffs at the awards, and the solution he came up with was to honor Satvat, a figure well-known in the games business for his efforts to help laid-off developers find new work. A brief video segment described how Satvat's project has helped "place nearly 3,000 people in jobs," and Satvat accepted the award with a tearful speech in which he challenged the crowd to make the industry better. Many viewers responded positively to the segment, including viewers in the industry, but some have criticized it as a cynical attempt to keep up the appearance of caring while celebrating the very people responsible for the poor state of the business—the executives in the audience whose companies ultimately fund The Game Awards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who oversaw Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the subsequent layoffs, is on the show's advisory board, for example. Some critics went well beyond denouncing the awards, however: After the ceremony, Satvat himself came under attack for his job at Tencent, where he's been a business development director for about a year and a half. The suggestion going around social media is that Satvat was presented as a kind of folk hero, but is actually part of the problem—or even a sinister "industry plant" whose heartwarming story was entirely manufactured. Satvat says that his job wasn't mentioned during the show because it's irrelevant. He began providing games industry job hunting resources before he started work at Tencent last year, and says that he doesn't deal with mergers there, didn't at his previous job at Amazon, and has never laid anyone off. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. "I've never signed a contract or personally been part of a deal that led to job losses in my career," wrote Satvat. "In fact, in some instances, like at [Amazon Web Services], I put great effort into making sure hundreds of peoples' jobs were saved during moments of restructuring. "I've also been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into,' usually by people who spent all of 8 seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across 5 different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know." I was aware of Satvat prior to the awards because, in the course of covering the industry's layoffs over the past couple years, his name has repeatedly come up in the aftermath of job cuts as the person out-of-work developers should seek out. I've understood him to be a well-liked figure whose efforts are genuinely appreciated by game developers who've lost their jobs over the past two years. That impression is reflected in the many positive comments posted about Satvat following his acceptance speech, such as in the replies to this post on BlueSky. "Amir got me a union job in Game Dev in 2024," reads one. "He deserves the world." The criticism, insults, and accusations Satvat is otherwise receiving don't appear to come from any one perspective—good faith criticism of The Game Awards is mixed in with shouting about China, antisemitism, and other staples of internet discourse most associated today with X. "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry—this is the 'reward' for two years of service," Satvat wrote. "...I did not want to say anything but there have been too many comments about my family, about my wife, about her religious background, and other things that are way over the line for me not to say anything." Satvat says that the post will be his last word on the negative comments, and that he will continue to pursue "positive, public service." Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

Title: The future roadmap – navigating the next decade as a product designer in tech

Atlassian Take the annual Work Life survey – your insights really help. Adapting to Change: How Key Trends in Data, AI, and Design-Led Innovation Will Shape the Future of Products Head of Design, Growth In today’s fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Globally, we are witnessing a profound transformation in how technology and design come together to address real human problems in powerful ways. As designers, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to shape this next decade of evolution—not just responding to change, but actively leaning into it. Two decades ago, product design was often an afterthought—a cosmetic touch-up to existing ideas. This was the “Lipstick-on-the-Pig” era when designers were brought in at the end to “make it pretty,” focusing solely on typography, color, and layout without considering the deeper problems. Design was disconnected from business/product strategy, and the most exciting work was typically found in agencies, leaving in-house design a distant second. Everything changed in 2007 with the iPhone. It wasn’t just another product; it was a seismic shift that redefined the importance of intuitive user experience and sophisticated design. Apple’s meticulous focus on the end-to-end journey—from unboxing to the seamless integration of hardware and software set a new benchmark. The App Store revolutionized how we accessed consumer products, establishing a new standard that required a structured approach with Apple’s human interface guidelines as the foundation for consistency. This era proved that good design is indeed good business, transforming the roles of designers, engineers, product managers, and marketers in ways we couldn’t have imagined. The iPhone didn’t just revolutionize mobile devices—it democratized access to information, opening the door for an entirely new generation of digital products. The 2010s were a transformative decade for design as we saw the rise of iconic platforms like Airbnb, Instagram, and Uber, which quickly became essential parts of our daily lives. These disruptors proved that innovative product experience, driven by user-centric thinking, could reshape entire industries. Meanwhile, companies that failed to adapt—like Blockbuster, Kodak, and Borders were left behind, overtaken by nimble upstarts like Netflix, Instagram, and Amazon – who leveraged technology and design to deliver superior experiences and enduring value. Another key milestone in the evolution of craft-focused, small-“d” “design” was the mainstream adoption of Design Thinking, championed by institutions like IDEO and Stanford’s d.school. This inclusive approach expanded the role of strategy-driven, capital-”D” “Design” beyond aesthetics, involving non-designers in crafting user experiences. Enterprise companies began to realize the transformative power of Design, reimagining their clunky enterprise software into consumer-grade experiences that became a competitive advantage. I was fortunate to be part of this movement at SAP, co-founding the AppHaus (a think-take innovation center) that transformed enterprise products. SAP, along with companies like IBM, Cisco, and Google, reimagined the design of enterprise products and elevated it from second-class citizen to a critical driver of business success. This decade was a remarkable period for Design innovation, with breakthroughs like responsive and mobile-first Design redefining user interaction across devices. The emergence of Design systems streamlined experiences, allowing for scalable, unified interfaces. And the rise of minimalism and flat Design made me, for one, particularly glad to bid farewell to skeuomorphic Design. Wearable technology began to integrate into our daily routines, and voice UI marked the beginning of hands-free, natural language interactions. While technology and engineering often steal the spotlight in discussions around these types of innovation, it’s essential to recognize that Design has been in the driver’s—or at least co-driver’s—seat in generating these disruptive transformations that have reset expectations for acceptable product experiences. As Designers, we’ve broadened and elevated our skillsets beyond our core design craft to encompass Systems Thinking, Design Thinking, User Research, Content Design and overlapping aspects of cross-functional collaboration (roadmapping, QA testing, etc.). As a result, we cemented our roles as integral partners alongside Engineering and Product teams. This shift established the expectation that Designers now influence and contribute throughout the entire product lifecycle. Fast forward to the 2020s, and it’s clear that Design has firmly established itself as a core competency in product development. We’ve reached a point where shipping a product without embedded Design would be unthinkable. The EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) triad is now industry standard, not because it’s a trend, but because we have tangible proof that it works. The real litmus test? Design literacy among roles like product managers, engineers, data scientists, and researchers has significantly increased, thanks to the collective effort we’ve made to demonstrate Design’s impact. In short, Product Design is here to stay. Looking back on the past two decades, I see incredible progress, but that doesn’t mean we can rest on our achievements. Like waves in the ocean, there’s always another one coming—a set of new challenges and opportunities that will require us to continue evolving and pushing the boundaries. Key trends shaping the future of Product Design are like waves—building momentum and power as they approach. We need to be ready to catch and ride them. Before diving in, let me offer a few disclaimers: this is not an exhaustive list, but these are the trends that stand out to me as being particularly impactful for the future of Design. I didn’t invent these ideas; many brilliant minds in tech are constantly looking around the corner, and I’ve synthesized a lot of that thinking here. These trends may seem obvious, but the value lies in how we position ourselves to harness their potential. The first trend shaping the future of Product Design is what I think of as The Data Tsunami in the age of affordable quantum computing. This isn’t just a wave—it’s a tidal force, with data being generated at unprecedented levels from every interaction, both active and passive, across all aspects of life. As quantum computing becomes more accessible, the instrumentation of everything we touch becomes the norm, flooding us with deep, complex data. The challenge for us as designers is to navigate this flood of information with intentionality. It’s no longer about simply collecting data; we must blend analytical understanding with creative intuition, ensuring our decisions are data-informed rather than blindly data-driven. As Adam Grant recently said, “The hallmark of expertise is no longer how much you know. It’s how well you synthesize.” In an age of information overload, the ability to recognize patterns and connect the dots is far more critical than just accumulating facts. The future of design will demand this deeper understanding—knowing how to ask the right questions, combine qualitative insights with quantitative data, and refine our instincts to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape. The next wave shaping product Design is The AI Effect. This one is no rogue wave; we’ve seen it building with increasing force. And it’s here for good. AI, combined with the explosion of data, is unlocking groundbreaking creative possibilities that were unimaginable just a few years ago. AI-driven tools are also revolutionizing productivity by cutting production time from months to minutes, significantly accelerating workflows and transforming how knowledge workers manage day-to-day tasks. The impact on productivity is unprecedented. AI is also democratizing product creation—people without Design or engineering backgrounds are now able to build 0-to-1 products with ease. This will necessitate as designers to be better taste makers by differentiate through experience, brand, and storytelling. But here’s the key: AI is just another tool—one that enhances, rather than replaces, our creative capabilities. As designers, we MUST embrace AI for the acceleration it offers, using it to craft the next generation of products that stand out in a crowded marketplace. How do you get started? Though it may seem daunting, it’s actually quite simple: Go play! There’s a tool for every interest! Dive into an AI powered tool in a space that you are passionate about, and explore how capabilities are evolving. Start crafting experiences whether at work or for your personal creativity. By embracing these tools and integrating them into your toolkit and your daily workflow, you’ll unlock productivity and new ways to innovate and push the boundaries of design. The next trend builds on the power of data and AI: The Interconnectedness of Products. As tools continue to proliferate, there will be a growing need for a layer that makes sense of and connects these products—a layer of true interconnectedness. This is where AI assistants or agents come in, seamlessly integrating and managing information across all the products we interact with, creating a unified experience for our personal, professional, and family lives. These AI-driven systems are set to become indispensable, enhancing productivity and embedding themselves into our everyday routines in ways that once seemed like science fiction. However, this shift also brings challenges: privacy concerns, ethical dilemmas, and the risk of over-reliance on AI could impact our cognitive abilities and social dynamics, manifesting as critical user experience problems to be solved. Despite these challenges, the adoption of AI assistants is a trend that cannot be overlooked. The global market for AI assistants is projected to reach $71.42 billion by 2031, growing at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.18%​. This growth underscores the urgency for designers and technologists to harness AI’s potential while addressing its complexities, shaping it into a tool that empowers rather than overwhelms. In today’s fast-paced world, design is no longer just about aesthetics—it’s the driving force behind innovation and survival. Countless technological trends are set to shape the future of product design, each redefining user experiences. Immersive technologies like AR/VR and mixed reality will transform how we engage with digital spaces. Universal digital currencies will enable seamless, borderless transactions, while advancements like 3D bioprinting and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will revolutionize healthcare, shifting the focus from treating illness to enhancing wellness. Smart city solutions and green technology integration are set to improve urban living and drive sustainability. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. At the core of next generation innovations lies one crucial factor – the user experience solving real human problems or opportunities that will ultimately determine the adoption and impact of these technologies. The reality we must face is that tech layoffs and the displacement of some roles by AI are indeed happening. But even as we navigate these challenges, we can’t lose sight of the opportunities ahead. For designers, Creativity remains our most valuable asset. This moment presents an incredible chance to play to our strengths to craft the next generation of experiences. One of the most exciting trends shaping the future of product Design is The Designpreneur Boom—a wave of designers redefining entrepreneurship by founding successful startups. We’ve already seen industry giants like Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia (Airbnb), Evan Sharp (Pinterest) and Char Hurley (co-founder of Youtube) demonstrate the incredible potential of Design-led companies. These founders didn’t just focus on design craft; they broadened their skills to include marketing, engineering, research, and business acumen. Some of these designpreneurs co-founded with others who had these important complementary skills. Take Dylan Field, for example. He gathered hands-on knowledge across disciplines (product design, engineering, marketing, data analytics, research etc.) that gave him a powerful holistic understanding and toolkit to build Figma into a billion-dollar company. This is super inspiring! This trend highlights a key takeaway—designers who expand their skill sets beyond traditional craft are uniquely positioned for entrepreneurial success. If we want to see more Design-founded startups, our educational institutions need to evolve, integrating interdisciplinary learning that includes technology, business, and leadership training. But don’t wait for formal education to catch up—self-education and hands-on experiences are just as critical. As the future unfolds, I hope we’ll see even more designpreneurs shaping the next generation of innovation. Let’s turn mockups into unicorns. The future of product design is filled with both exciting opportunities and inevitable challenges. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, it’s clear that some jobs will be replaced or redefined. As designers, we can approach these changes from an empowered place. Instead of fearing the shifts, we can embrace them knowing that we have exciting possibilities to influence and drive the next generation of product experience. The need for thoughtful, impactful design will only grow, and those of us willing to adapt will be at the forefront of this transformation. Siva Sabaretnam Head of Design, Growth Embrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections – and have fun along the way.

Title: Why the Dow is suddenly in a historic funk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on its worst losing streak in nearly 50 years. The major index has fallen for nine straight trading days, its largest stretch of consecutive declines since 1978. The move lower in the Dow comes as large-cap tech has largely been holding up the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) throughout December. The Dow's losses amount to roughly 3%, or more than 1,500 points, in the past nine trading sessions. The index has fallen from a record close of 45,014 on Dec. 4 to 43,499 as of Tuesday's close. In that same time frame, the S&P 500 is down about 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up almost 2%. Given the Dow's construction, it's not benefitting from the tech rally. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, just four — Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. This means the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, hasn't benefitted from massive rallies in Tesla (TSLA), which is up more than 37% in the past 10 days, or Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), which has risen 14% in the same time period. Instead, the Dow has been pulled down, partly due to the recent sell-off in Nvidia stock. The blue-chip index added Nvidia on Nov. 8. Since then, one of the hottest stocks in the market has cooled off, with shares down nearly 12%. "It's really the tech leadership versus everything else, value versus growth," WisdomTree global chief investment officer Jeremy Schwartz told Yahoo Finance. A sell-off in healthcare stocks has also weighed on the Dow. UnitedHealth (UNH) is down about 20% in the past 10 days following the murder of its CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4. Other healthcare stocks have also lagged, with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN) both down more than 4% in the past 10 trading sessions. Schwartz said the Dow's decline hasn't been surprising given the run-up in stocks this year, though. "We are still optimistic for next year. We think stocks versus bonds is still [the place] to be in the markets," he said. "But there was so much strong positioning for this rally and for this seasonal rally that it's not actually a surprise to see this pullback." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Stock market today: Dow logs longest losing streak since 1978 as stocks slide ahead of Fed decision

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the session down roughly 0.6%, registering its ninth straight day of losses. The last 9-day losing streak for the Dow was Feb. 1978. Prior to that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. The other major indexes dropped in tandem on Tuesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) losing about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Fed policymakers kicked off their final gathering of the year earlier in the trading day, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares closed down over 1%. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Prices retreated to just above $106,500 a coin. US stocks closed down across the board on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) logging its biggest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index fell roughly 0.6% to register its ninth straight day of losses. The last time that happened was February 1978. The other major indexes also finished the session lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling around 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost about 0.3% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. December’s market action has been all about a rally from several members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) all hit fresh record highs on Monday. Even on a day like Tuesday, where all three major indexes were in the red, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) hit a record high. While each individual stock has its own potential story working for it — like Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ties with Donald Trump sparking a post-election rally — market strategists believe there is also a broader theme at play: The Magnificent Seven have become a place to hide when the direction of the macro narrative becomes uncertain. "When you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a 'defensive,'" Citi head of us equity strategy Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. The large-cap bias among investors has come as markets have moved to expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than previously anticipated over the next year amid signs of sticky inflation and solid economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is on pace for its longest losing streak in 46 years. The blue-chip index slid about 0.8% by afternoon trade on Tuesday, coming off an eighth straight day of losses. The last nine-day losing streak for the Dow was February 1978. Before that, the index suffered an 11-day losing streak in 1974 and another in 1971. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was the biggest loser within the Dow, falling over 3%. Goldman Sachs (GS), Salesforce (CRM), and Nvidia (NVDA) followed, each down about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock recovered from earlier losses but still traded down over 1% Tuesday as investors grew cautious the AI spending that fueled its rise could ease or spread to rivals. Shares of the AI chipmaker have fallen over 10% since reaching a record closing high of $148.88 in early November. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia made a swift ascent to the top, from a graphics card company primarily used for video games to the world’s leading supplier of AI chips, as Big Tech goes all-in on generative artificial intelligence. In 2024, it traded places with Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company, and in early November, it replaced the once-dominant Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note last week he expects Nvidia’s market cap to surpass $4 trillion in 2025. But following its record close in November, Nvidia shares began to fall after commentary from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. Rumors of overheating issues with its latest Blackwell AI servers stoked fears of further delays to the production ramp-up, sending shares down even more. Even Nvidia’s most recent blowout earnings report, which surpassed bullish analysts’ already-high expectations, did little to help the stock's trajectory. Adding to Nvidia’s troubles, China’s competition authority last week said it has launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia’s $7 billion acquisition of networking technology company Mellanox. Meanwhile, the competition is heating up, with companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Broadcom (AVGO) developing and rolling out their own respective chips. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices surged to another record on Tuesday, briefly touching above $108,000 early Tuesday before retreating to just around $107,000 by mid-afternoon. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has enjoyed a sizable rally following Donald Trump's presidential win, rising over 50% since that time. Trump's win pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs in the immediate aftermath of the election, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who announced he would step down on Jan. 20. Despite bitcoin's moves to the upside on Tuesday, other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names moved lower. Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell about 1% to trade above $3,900 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, dropped around 4%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, saw shares fall roughly 1%. Bank of America's latest fund manager's survey could be summed in up three words from BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett: "super-bullish sentiment." Respondents are bullish about US stocks, flashing the largest percentage of respondents overweight US equities on record. They're bullish about equities in general, with global risk appetite at a three-year high and investors' allocation to cash sitting at a three-year low. And they're increasingly bullish that the global economy won't enter recession in 2025. Just 6% of respondents said they see a "hard landing" — where higher rates help tip the economy into an outright downturn — in the next 12 months. This marked the lowest number of respondents to call for a hard landing in six months. This reflects the broad consensus on Wall Street that, at least in the US, above-trend growth is largely expected in 2025. But as we wrote in Tuesday's Morning Brief, when everyone's on one side of an argument, it often raises eyebrows from strategists and economists. "My concern dial has gone up a little bit," Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning. "Two years ago, back in 2022, I recall the consensus was largely on the recession train for the coming year (I took the other side) even though labor markets were fine and homebuilding stocks were outperforming despite rate hikes. "Today, the consensus is fairly sanguine on growth next year. However, labor markets have been cooling and homebuilding stocks are presently underperforming despite rate cuts. I see myself on the more cautious side of the consensus at present." Telsa (TSLA) — now less than $100 billion away from eclipsing the market cap of Facebook owner Meta (META) — continued to enjoy a massive rally on Tuesday. Shares of the EV maker rose as much as 4.5%, boosting its market cap to around $1.54 trillion. The uptick in the stock price comes after Mizuho upgraded the company to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $515 a share, up from the prior $230. The firm cited a looser regulatory framework as a tailwind for shares in 2025 following Donald Trump's presidential win. Musk, a close ally of Trump, will co-head the new "Department of Government Efficiency" in the president-elect's second term. Meta, which has a market cap of about $1.57 trillion, fell nearly 1% in late morning trade. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade before bouncing off of its session lows. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade," per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement. “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz wrote, "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.5%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5%. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday. November retail sales grew at a faster pace than Wall Street analysts had expected, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer and indicating that the holiday shopping season in the US is off to a strong start. Retail sales rose 0.7% in November. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in October were revised up to a 0.5% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. A 2.4% month-over-month increase in motor vehicle and auto parts sales, as well as a 1.8% increase in online sales, drove the gains. November sales, excluding auto and gas, rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. The control group in Tuesday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the Gross Domestic Product reading for the quarter, increased by 0.4%, in line with estimates.

Title: Move Over 'Rage Applying' And 'Quiet Quitting,' 2025 Will Be The Year Of 'Revenge Quitting'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Over the past few years, people’s feelings about their jobs have changed dramatically. Initially, there was “rage applying,” where employees who were angry about their jobs applied for dozens of other jobs. Then there was “quiet quitting,” in which people chose to work as little as possible while still staying employed and probably applying for other positions. As 2025 approaches, a new trend emerges: “revenge quitting.” Revenge quitting is all about leaving loudly, deliberately and with purpose instead of quietly disengaging or passively browsing job listings. People are quitting loudly because they're fed up with feeling undervalued, overworked and stuck in unhealthy workplaces. Don't Miss: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. “The job market is starting to loosen up and for those who have been simmering with frustration, this might be the year they finally quit – not just quietly but loudly,” Edel Holliday-Quinn, a business psychologist, told Business Insider. For many, the seeds of this trend were planted during the chaotic shifts of the pandemic. Employees felt overworked and alienated due to layoffs, increased workloads and ongoing back-and-forth arguments on hybrid work arrangements. Toxic workplaces, which are still too prevalent, added to these annoyances. In fact, according to a Businessolver survey, 52% of CEOs and 42% of employees said their workplace culture was toxic. For many, the frustration is no longer bearable. Amazon's recent return-to-office mandate is a prime example of how these frustrations are coming to a head. CEO Andy Jassy's decision to require employees to work in the office full-time starting in 2025 has caused an uproar. See Also: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? According to a Blind survey, 73% of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers are thinking about leaving because of the policy and 80% of them claim they know coworkers who feel the same. Although Amazon defends the action to encourage creativity and teamwork, many employees view it as a strict and tone-deaf decision that disregards the reality of the current workplace and are prepared to leave. Younger workers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, are also playing a big role in revenge quitting. They're less willing to put up with old-fashioned rules or work environments that clash with their values. A poll by Indeed showed that nearly 40% of younger workers might quit their jobs over political disagreements with their bosses. The intense political climate amplifies these tensions, especially during election cycles, leaving employees feeling disrespected and alienated in workplaces where they're expected to coexist with opposing views. For them, walking away is less about a paycheck and more about integrity.

Join 30,000+ shareholders and invest at $0.26/share today. Even industries like cryptocurrency, which once seemed exciting, are seeing people lose interest. Travis Kling, Chief Investment Officer at Ikigai Asset Management, discussed a “quiet quitting” trend in crypto. Many workers in the industry feel let down by broken promises and poor leadership. When industries don't live up to their hype, workers feel betrayed and leave – sometimes dramatically. Revenge quitting shows how the balance of power between workers and employers is shifting. Workers aren't just putting up with bad jobs anymore; they're rejecting them loudly. As Holliday-Quinn explained, “Dissatisfaction has been quietly brewing. The disconnect between leadership and the workforce isn't just a communication issue – it's a retention crisis waiting to happen.” Businesses should take note of this trend. If they don’t adjust, they risk losing their finest employees. They need to create healthier workplace cultures, provide flexibility and demonstrate empathy to maintain their teams’ satisfaction. Employees are more inclined to stay or at least depart amicably when they feel valued, which improves the transition. Read Next: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Title: Fantasy Double Features of 2024

Illustrations by Stephanie Lane Gage. The results of our seventeenth annual writers poll are in! Every year, we ask our contributors to program a fantasy double feature, placing one new release and one older film back to back, coaxing out subtle resonances or following a thread—of theme, genre, performance—through the years. We invite you to test out some of these inspired combinations for yourself over the holidays. (And see if you can spot the pairing that three of our contributors recommended, independently of each other.) If journalism is the first draft of history, maybe this feature can be the first draft of film culture to come. Here’s to another year of great cinema. Dylan Adamson Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (Albert Lewin, 1951) From the nowhere-shore of the mind to the nowhere-horizon of the future, a boat casts off, possessed of a clarity of purpose that will be reserved from our view. Shaking off the accumulated dust of two thousand years of human culture, one of these films looks much better than the other. Ryan Akler-Bishop Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Our Daily Bread (King Vidor, 1934) Two titans of narrative cinema self-fund their dream projects: both reckonings with the fantasy of American utopia, both box-office bellyflops, both sagas of charismatic figureheads—Men of the People—buckling beneath their ego and vice. Dreams of a collective future, burdens of individualist desire: Cesar Catilina, John Sims, Francis Ford Coppola, King Vidor. Mark Asch Slow Shift (Shambhavi Kaul, 2024) + The Clock (Christian Marclay, 2010) In her short Slow Shift, Kaul films the rocks of Hampi, India—both the ruins of the ancient capital of Vijayanagara and the boulder-strewn hills that surround it. The traces of a long-lost history, observed in Kaul's long takes and by a population of chattering monkeys, emphasize nonhuman time scales: the geological, the evolutionary, the cinematic. Is the film's vision prehuman or posthuman? Either way, the nine-minute Slow Shift is the opposite of the 24-hour The Clock, back at the Museum of Modern Art this winter, a supercut bound absolutely to the rhythms of industrial modernity. Paul Attard Carroll Gardens (Ernie Gehr, 2024) + Time Being (Andrew Noren, 2001) Definitive proof that old dogs can learn new tricks. Miriam Bale La chimera (Alice Rohrwacher, 2024) + Heat (Michael Mann, 1995) Flying and Driving: My pairing has less to do with similarities between two films (both are stone-cold masterpieces) and more to do with movie thoughts while in motion. My third viewing of Alice Rohrwacher’s La chimera was on an airplane. I didn’t want to use the airline headphones and forgot the cord for mine, so I watched with no sound. It was observing the adroit framing and movement isolated from plot and performances that confirmed to me it’s an all-time classic. One of the best films this year, decade, century. The night after seeing Heat introduced by Michael Mann—my first time watching it since moving to LA—I found myself driving an unusual route and ended up exactly where the final shootout was filmed, planes flying close overhead, Waingro’s Hilton hideout in sight. Mann’s film is one of the best LA films precisely for its emphasis on driving, both traffic on freeways and alternate routes. Heat helped me better see my own surroundings. Juan Barquin Castration Movie (Louise Weard, 2024) + The Plug Lady (Anthony Saladino, 2004) If it were possible to force every single trans person to watch both of these life-changing movies, I would. Saladino's work is an abject monstrosity; arguably one of the most misguided “trans films” to ever be made, and yet one I couldn’t look away from. You may very well spend weeks—nay, months—leaving your friends voicemails saying “This is the pluuuuuuuuuuug lady.” On the flip side: Louise Weard's Castration Movie is four and a half hours of what I believe trans cinema should look like. Genuinely lived-in from top to bottom, from cis to trans, it's a true “slice of life” (not unlike Imogen Binnie’s novel Nevada). Perhaps the characters will be off-putting, but they are painfully (and hilariously) real, and it's impossible not to feel at home around people joking about transmaxxing and how it's ableism to expect someone to read Dune. Also, only one of these two movies features a castration. Can you guess which one? Robert Barry The Substance (Coralie Fargeat, 2024) + Asparagus (Suzan Pitt, 1979) A shared fascination with bathrooms and their functions. Sam Bodrojan Challengers (Luca Guadagnino, 2024) + Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (Albert Lewin, 1951) Two otherwise minor directors, two laughably showy works of beautiful artifice, two ecstatically sad treatises on the sublimation of the self in the name of desire. Joshua Bogatin Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + The Palace (Roman Polanski, 2023) New Hollywood heaven and hell. Coppola tries to save humanity by harkening back to the classics and our sense of democratic purpose; Polanski pisses all over the entire Western world and shits the bed one last time. Two anti-masterpieces that straddle the line between incoherent and overly simplistic. The two movies that had me most questioning my own sanity and taste this year. At first glance, they both seem laughably bad from a technical standpoint, yet their staying power is immense. Coppola believes in a future where scientific progress and technocratic elites are capable of redeeming humanity. His vision of utopia looks like a cross between an Apple store, an erector set, and the plot of a 75-year-old dime-store paperback. Polanski depicts a decadent pre-Y2K past populated by gross elites farcically killing and fucking each other into the dawning of the new millennium. He ends the movie on a vulgar non sequitur, a throwaway bestiality joke that’s impressive far more for its bad taste than comedic value. The fact that it’s delivered by a man as repulsive as those he’s lampooning only increases the bad vibes and sleazoid factor. It was hard to find two other films that felt as startlingly contemporary this year, in no large part because of their many inanities and provocations. Yet in a year that felt dominated by depression, repulsion, and outrage you can guess which one felt more honest. Danielle Burgos Rumours (Guy Maddin, 2024) + Head (Bob Rafelson, 1968) Surreal, goofy swan songs (of the modern world and the Monkees) packed with stars utilizing and fighting tech and their pasts, traipsing toward each one’s only possible ending. Delightsome. Grace Byron Pollinator (Tourmaline, 2024) + The Giverny Document (Ja’Tovia Gary, 2019) Both films are impressionistic reads of history, illness, and love—though not always in the way one might expect. Ghosts hang heavy over gardens, fiction and archive become one. Both films are about historical Black figures and the way they creep into the present. Tourmaline invokes Marsha P. Johnson in a beautiful, kaleidoscopic short film that premiered at this year’s Whitney Biennial, perhaps one of the best things on view at the time. Gary’s film originated a few years earlier, though it also screened at the Museum of Modern Art this past spring. It's a staggering testament to Gary’s strength as a filmmaker—combining the gardens of Monet and Nina Simone with interviews with Black women on the street in Harlem about whether or not they feel safe. Who is allowed the fantasy of security? Of hope? Glitchy experimentation and surreal images of flowers overtake both films; by the end, one wakes from a dream. A warning, a talisman, a hypnotic spell. Celluloid Liberation Front Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + The Black Marble (Harold Becker, 1980) Two touching films about all the beauty and tenderness Russians have brought to America in the doomed quest to humanize it. Amanda Chen The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + Poison (Todd Haynes, 1991) —Jean Genet, Funeral Rites “How dark do you want to go?” Phil Coldiron “Anton Bruckner,” from Cycle XV of Eniaios (Gregory Markopoulos, 1947–91/2004–ongoing) + Overture (Stan Douglas, 1986) There are plenty of points of comparison and contrast—both involve cycles; both are built from alternations of light and dark (the photographic imagery in the “Bruckner” reels is sparse even in comparison to the rest of Eniaios, and its passages of clear leader are the longest I’ve seen in the eleven cycles so far, while Douglas appropriates Edison Film Co. footage of trains passing through Rocky Mountain tunnels); one concerns itself with an artist at the dawn of artistic modernism (Bruckner), the other with an artist from the apex of artistic modernism (Proust); one comes from the height of postmodernism, the other, when its decades-long premiere concludes the summer after next, might be taken as the end of cinematic modernism—but it was a line from Douglas that clicked things into place for me: “In a way my intention was to show European culture arriving in North America but not being able to deal with this new situation.” I suppose Eniaios is the grandest, the most gorgeous and deranged monument anyone has managed to build in the name of that “not being able to deal.” Adrian Curry The Beast (Bertrand Bonello, 2024) + Someone’s Watching Me! (John Carpenter, 1978) John Carpenter’s 1978 made-for-TV thriller (the best old film I saw for the first time this year) would pair nicely with one of my very favorite new films, or at least its central section. In both, a beautiful, gap-toothed blonde (Lauren Hutton in one, Léa Seydoux in the other), newly arrived in Los Angeles, lives alone in a place with too many windows and is stalked by a murderous stranger. The older film channels Hitchcock while the newer channels Henry James, but the similarities make you wonder if Bonello had the Carpenter film in mind. Robert Daniels Sometimes I Think about Dying (Rachel Lambert, 2024) + The Slender Thread (Sydney Pollack, 1965) It’s unfortunate that Rachel Lambert’s ruminative character study went largely unnoticed this year. As Fran, a lonely, socially awkward office worker whose suicidal ideations are beginning to get the best of her, Daisy Ridley is uniquely aching, especially when the unassuming Robert (Dave Merheje) arrives. Fran and Robert do go on a few cute, low-key dates. But Fran’s insecurities—intensified by the gloomy, remote Oregon surroundings—disrupt her potential happiness. In Sydney Pollack’s San Francisco–set directorial debut, Anne Bancroft is Inga, an unmoored mother in a marriage disrupted by a secret. In a dim motel room Inga ingests a bottle of pills and then calls a crisis helpline manned by an inexperienced student named Alan (Sidney Poitier). Like Lambert’s picture, The Slender Thread is about the overwhelming desire to feel a connection, and the power recognition can bring to those who feel invisible. Jon Dieringer The Firing Squad (Timothy A. Chey, 2024) + Shadow: Dead Riot (Derek Wan Man-Kit, 2006) Twenty years apart, two four-walled, low-budget films shot on garish HD video in abandoned prisons, one by born-again Christians, the other by likely Satanists. What Shadow: Dead Riot lacks in The Firing Squad’s star power (Sorbo, Gooding Jr., Roberts) it makes up for with the late Tony Todd–summoning hordes of undead criminals rising up against their former jailers. Flavia Dima Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) A double-sided portrait of political struggle in the galvanizing heat of the moment and in its bitter, disillusioned aftermath. Writing this while Romania, my home country, is smack in the middle between the two, in the midst of an election cycle that seems to have set everything on fire (and has prompted the largest anti-fascist protests in the past century!) feels providential. Katarina Docalovich Cent Mille Milliards (Virgil Vernier, 2024) + Somewhere (Sofia Coppola, 2010) Unexpected familial connections are found between a tween girl and a desensitized man-child idly questioning his life choices in cities so immensely luxurious they consequently become alienating. In lieu of traditional plot structures, Coppola and Vernier both employ colorful flourishes, carefully arranged compositions, and fleeting snapshots to effectively capture existential disaffection with a surprising lightness. Katherine Franco An Odd Turn (Francisco Lezama, 2024) + Mahjong (Edward Yang, 1996) Two studies of two cities—Taipei, Buenos Aires—almost 30 years apart, but with the same concern: the value of the dollar. Where Edward Yang gives us Hard Rock Cafe, Francisco Lezama skips straight to the currency exchange center. Two invitations to attempt materialist history by way of comic form. Sasha Frere-Jones Foragers (Jumana Manna, 2024) + A Letter From Beirut (Jocelyne Saab, 1978) Soham Gadre Samsara (Lois Patiño, 2024) + Blue (Derek Jarman, 1993) Lawrence Garcia Misericordia (Alain Guiraudie, 2024) + La Maladie de Sachs (Michel Deville, 1999) Kaya Genç Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994) As the credits rolled, I immediately wanted to rewatch Anora. Ani’s gesture of gratitude transformed into despair, and something resembling hope, and I was in tears. I savored the film’s aesthetic shifts between neorealism and Godfather-esque mafia movies. The home-invasion sequence is now part of film history; the search scenes reminded me of another Palme d’Or winner from the US, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction—the car shooting, Winston Wolfe’s cleanup, the diner visit. Time flows so realistically in both films despite the outrageous plot twists and the artificiality of the worlds they depict. These are films to get lost in and enjoy as the world falls into darkness and madness in 2025. Annie Geng A Traveler's Needs (Hong Sang-soo, 2024) + Certified Copy (Abbas Kiarostami, 2010) Leonardo Goi Eephus (Carson Lund, 2024) + Last Night at the Alamo (Eagle Pennell, 1983) A gang of middle-aged amateur baseball players meet for one last match before their beloved field will be paved over and replaced with a new middle school. A crew of drifters and inveterate tipplers join forces for a final night of drinking before their favorite Houston dive will be torn down. These snapshots of soon-to-be-shuttered hangouts aren’t (just) tributes to some brick-and-mortar buildings, but to a certain way of being among others and looking at the world. Similarly receptive to the surreal and the unexpected, they show that wonder can exist within the claustrophobic tedium of small-town America—and the epiphany is nothing short of riveting. If either has escaped your radar, be sure to catch them—and while you’re at it, watch Pennell’s The Whole Shootin’ Match (1978), too. Peter Goldberg Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Le Pont du Nord (Jacques Rivette, 1981) City films can be kinetic, symphonic, elegiac, poetic, epistolary. It’s rarer that they express the unnerving feeling of living in a world under construction. Coppola and Rivette take opposite approaches to the problem: give the city ever more elaborate dimensions or flatten it into a claustrophobic surface. Megalopolis is a work of unbalanced maximalism, bulldozing the senses by building ever larger in its search for a vague, tantalizing urban harmony. Romantic, autocratic Cesar looks down from on high, determined to tame not just space but time. Rivette’s method is horizontal, turning the city into a dangerous game. His heroines are marginal, thrown out of place by Paris’s centrifugal energy. They move through the city like tunnelers, not supposed to look at it from above. For them, someone else’s vision is a threat. The only answer is to tear out their eyes and keep moving. Caroline Golum She Is Conann (Bertrand Mandico, 2024) + A Feast of Man (Caroline Golum, 2017) Right before showtime I ran into fellow Spectacle comrade Zachary Fleming, who played James, the butler, in and was the assistant director of my first feature, A Feast of Man. Must’ve been kismet! Imagine my utter shock when I watched the final act of Conann, wherein (SPOILER ALERT!) our titular heroine informs a motley crew of artists that in order to inherit her fortune, they must agree to eat her dead body. If this sounds familiar, you may be one of twelve people who've seen my movie, in which a recently deceased playboy’s will stipulates that his closest friends do the same. Somewhere in the dark of the Courthouse theater, Zachary and I locked eyes. Was Mandico a secret Feast head? Or was this simply confirmation from the universe that microbudget filmmaking will always surf the avant-garde? We may never solve this mystery definitively, but I spent the better part of the next week feeling very “seen.” Emerson Goo Background (Khaled Abdulwahed, 2024) + Blessed Blessed Oblivion (Jumana Manna, 2010) When I initially watched Background, I found its minimalism too austere to connect with. But now I recognize in its deceptive simplicity the same tenderness and tension openly displayed in a film like Blessed Blessed Oblivion. Abdulwahed can’t hold his father’s hand, so he carefully cuts it out in Photoshop, lifting it from one photo to another. It’s an obsessive gesture against the dominion of the border and the time of captivity, like those performed by the hands on which Manna’s film fixates as they wash windows and pump iron. She depicts not only masculinity but also the objects it works over and through. In both films, the intensity of this attachment, and its ability to “transcend materiality” (Walid Daqqa), does not come automatically: it is cultivated through discipline. It’s fitting that the film that grew on me most this year, because I couldn’t stop thinking about it, taught me this. Jenna Ham Melody Electronics (Albert Birney, 2024) + Moonstruck (Norman Jewison, 1987) You're watching the “VCR” section of Albert Birney’s walkthrough of an imaginary video game called Melody Electronics. Soft and snowy synths fall on the soundtrack while a selection screen displays VHS covers from around 1988: Beetlejuice, Big.… And it’s Moonstruck that you (the player) pick to watch. “Good choice,” Melody says; then, pixelated Cher and Cage kiss on screen. During the credits, the NES-style moon rounds above (like a big pizza pie…). Both films are snowglobes: they orbit specific moments, to preserve the prettiness of a season. Moonstruck considers ancestry, lineage, ending on a portrait of family members from before the film’s story time, whilst Birney’s homely render of 1988 logs the ancestors of today’s electronics. To burrow, even to the near past, is a festive practice that celebrates the passing day; at the end of 2024, I was warmed by these two a lot. Jawni Han Juror #2 (Clint Eastwood, 2024) + The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962) Sometimes truth is not justice. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. Sasha Han Melting Fire Iceman (Heesue Kwon, 2024) + The Dante Quartet (Stan Brakhage, 1987) Hellfire is the impetus for the meeting of these films. Consumed by Dante’s lyrics at a point of personal upheaval, Brakhage had come to see visions of hell. He applied them to 70mm film stock, using the aspect ratio of filmic epics past and present. If Brakhage directly expresses the traces of human intervention on the medium of film, Kwon's Melting Fire Iceman fuses analogue and generative AI technology to assert that the presence of the human is essential to facilitate the cinematic experience. As a cinema goes up in flames and the audience leaves, she turns her attention to the custodian workers of the theater who are left behind. In this emptiness, Kwon hauls her cinematic apparatus—projectors, Nipkow disks, a live camera, and an image-diffusion model appearing to hallucinate and dream—and herself as projectionist in front of the audience. While Kwon fiddles, manipulates, and operates the equipment, the hallucinations of AI reveal themselves as reflections, not of a sentient artificial intelligence but of the conductor of images herself. Eric Hynes Bird (Andrea Arnold, 2024) + The Butcher Boy (Neil Jordan, 1997) Films that are fully—formally and aesthetically—committed to the subjective points of view of adolescent protagonists who've been orphaned or abandoned. Spectral visions appear to both Francie and Bailey, each a divine witness summoned to redress the children’s invisibility. George Iskander Bye Bye Tiberias (Lina Soualem, 203) + Alexandria...Again and Forever (Youssef Chahine, 1989) Lina Soualem and her mother, Hiam Abbass, return to the latter’s village, Deir Hanna in occupied Palestine, to trace the stories of the women in their family: their expulsion from Tiberias, their lives in Deir Hanna, and their dreams of return. Set in 1987 during the Egyptian Actors’ Union strike, Youssef Chahine's autofictive Alexandria...Again and Forever follows his self-insert, Yehia, as he navigates a changing film industry, visions of the past, and dreams of the future. Motivated by their love of film, both Abbass and Chahine left home to pursue careers abroad—Abbass for Europe, Chahine for the United States. As they look back, nostalgia and sweetness intertwine with longing and regret: Abbass remarks again and again, “Don't open the gate to past sorrows,” and Chahine writes an elegy of a city that has become unfamiliar. To be Arab, in diaspora or exile, is to recount the past, again and forever. Pierre Jendrysiak The Curse S01E10: “Green Queen” (Nathan Fielder, 2024) + Cracking Up (Jerry Lewis, 1983) When I watched The Curse earlier this year, and especially this insane last episode, all I could think was: nothing has ever looked and felt like this. But then I gave it a thought and remembered my experience discovering all of the Jerry Lewis features during lockdown. They were just as surreal, strange, hilarious and awkward. They share a lot—not only this idiosyncratic “cringiness,” but something related to an altered experience of reality; a feeling of not belonging anywhere; a melancholy of slapstick; a radical, almost anarchic aesthetic; a strange relationship to Judaism and Jewish humor. For a double feature, I could only pick Cracking Up, Lewis’s final feature film, and probably his saddest. Jonah Jeng In a Violent Nature (Chris Nash, 2024) + Amer (Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani, 2009) Inverted slasher/giallo. In a Violent Nature invokes Jason Voorhees’s lakeside rampages, but here the camera closely tracks the mute killer as he lumbers through tranquil woodland, butchering hapless campers. Background becomes foreground; instead of residing largely offscreen and in the shadows per slasher tradition, the undead monster is the film’s enigmatic visual anchor. With Amer, an experimental remix of giallo iconography, texture and subtext become text. The roughness of fabric, the dampness of skin, the hotness of breath, the coldness of metal, the eroticism that emerges through this orgy of sensation—such aspects are visually and sonically amplified, igniting the senses and decentering more conventional plot beats and genre trappings. Kerosene Jones Love Lies Bleeding (Rose Glass, 2024) + BloodSisters: Leather, Dykes and Sadomasochism (Michelle Handelman, 1995) Two films about alternative forms of care and social reproduction against cis male domination and the medical industrial complex. Meditations on the liberatory potential of kink and the necessity of Sapphic violence. Body hacking. Bodies rendered illegible to hegemony. Killer music syncs. Pheromone-soaked deviations from homonormativity. People, places, and things that could be categorized as “bodacious.” Rachel Elizabeth Jones La chimera (Alice Rohrwacher, 2024) + Crumbs (Miguel Llansó, 2015) Melancholic, vaguely edged quests across landscapes animated by marginal living situations, busted train stations, and relics of negotiated value. Unseen forces distinctly at work, above and below—what good are human eyes? Radu Jude The Zone of Interest (Jonathan Glazer, 2024) + Auschwitz (Uwe Boll, 2011) Daniel Kasman Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + The Spy in Black (Michael Powell, 1939) Murderers among us. Brandon Kaufman The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed (Joanna Arnow, 2024) + Bad Girl (Frank Borzage, 1931) —Gillian Rose, Love’s Work Fareyah Kaukab The Exploding Girl (Jonathan Vinel and Caroline Poggi, 2024) + Notre-Dame de la Croisette (Daniel Schmid, 1981) Women longing for connection—each so distinctly tied to her era. From the 1980s to 2024, Candice erupts into her surroundings, her emotions imprisoned within her body, while Betty physically imposes herself on spaces where she is not allowed. Both stories use physical spaces to mirror their emotional turmoil. Leonard Krähmer The Periphery of the Base (Zhou Tao, 2024) + Coal Money (Wang Bing, 2009) With no discernible superstructure in sight, these two films must stick to the material(istic) world at hand: Zhou observes from afar how construction workers get lost in the dusty beige of the vast Gobi Desert (as the light fades, the camera joins in by disappearing into the grainy shadows); Wang, of course, stays much closer to his subjects to witness the heated price negotiations between fatigued lorry drivers who move coal from the Shanxi mines to the port of Tianjin. Coincidentally, both have a 53-minute runtime, which almost calls for them to be shown side by side, intensifying the already inherent layering effects. Kaitlyn A. Kramer Hors du temps (Olivier Assayas, 2024) + La chambre (Chantal Akerman, 1972) December's chill provides a nice excuse to find oneself in familiar interiors. Make room for nostalgia. Settle in. A double feature best seen at home. Elena Lazic The Devil's Bath (Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, 2024) + The Seventh Victim (Mark Robson, 1943) Granted, this would be one of the most depressing double bills of all time. But besides their shared general theme (which I won’t spoil here), these two wonderful films are united by the unusual way they go about unveiling that theme, to stunning and devastating effect. Movies that find ingenious ways of revealing their hand—or, to put it more grossly, of dispensing information—are rare these days, but they’re the ones that tend to stay with me the most. Manuela Lazic About Dry Grasses (Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2023) + Local Hero (Bill Forsyth, 1983) Two wonderful films about proud men having to move to an unfamiliar environment for work and hating the place initially, but then going through a humbling experience as their sense of self and their morality get challenged. Phuong Le Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass (The Quay Brothers, 2024) + Double Suicide (Masahiro Shinoda, 1969) What do puppets dream of when they go to sleep? In the Quay Brothers’ latest, puppets, stop-motion animation, and live-action vignettes form an unearthly journey of reveries and nightmares. Among the various repetitions, the emphasis on capricious time devices suggests a temporal limbo and the futility of cheating fate. This sense of inevitability also looms in Masahiro Shinoda’s film, which reinterprets an eighteenth-century puppet play with live actors and expressionistic sets. As the walls close in on the doomed lovers—figuratively and literally—the film retains the tradition of kuroko, black-clad stagehands who silently reposition the scenery and stage props. Their reflexive movements absorb the invisible societal forces that animate the illicit romance. Like the traveler in Sanatorium, the unhappy couple in Double Suicide also head toward a predestined end. Through optical illusions rich in artifice, these films reveal the souls of their characters, using both traditional and modernist techniques. Dora Leu A Traveler’s Needs (Hong Sang-soo, 2024) + Haru (Morita Yoshimitsu, 1996) Idiots struggling to communicate is my favorite genre in cinema, as in life. Two films about language, love, and cinema, obsessed with communication on a formal level: the language of love, the language of cinema; love for language, love for cinema. About half of Haru’s runtime consists of written text on screen, and the best instance of zoom within Morita’s cinema deserves to be paired with a Hong. I also liked...the melodies.... Max Levin Rumours (Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson, and Galen Johnson, 2024) + I.K.U. (Shu Lea Cheang, 2000) Horny at the end of the world and at the beginning. Z. W. Lewis Henry Fonda for President (Alexander Horwath, 2024) + Film Emigration from Nazi Germany (Günter Peter Straschek, 1975) Non-Americans viewing America, making America, becoming America. Rebecca Liu Black Dog (Guan Hu, 2024) + John Wick (Chad Stahelski, 2014) Taciturn local man with a troubled past gets a new lease of life with a canine companion; mess with it at your peril. Chloe Lizotte Bogancloch (Ben Rivers, 2024) + Crank (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, 2006) Do everything. Slow down with Ben Rivers and Jake Williams in the Scottish Highlands: revel in the stillness and majesty of the natural world, trace the contours of Williams’s everyday routine, observe the delicate textures of light and natural fabrics, note a poignant rhyme between the decaying film grain and the ephemeral nature of mortality. Literally watch an uninterrupted take of Williams falling asleep in the woods, which prompted walkouts from the weak at the film’s Locarno premiere. Once you have the resting pulse of a marathon runner, Crank it back up to normal—then to dangerous. Jason Statham has been poisoned, and if he doesn’t want to die in an hour, he has to keep adrenaline coursing through his body, whatever it takes. He snorts loose cocaine off the ground. He shuts his hand in a hot waffle iron. He rapidly inhales and discards dozens of bottles of nasal spray while running around a hospital. In a sequence set to Harry Nilsson’s “Everybody’s Talkin’” (the rest of the film sounds like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater), he jumps on top of the seat of his speeding motorcycle and spreads his arms wide, Christ-like, as he bombs down the streets of LA. If all of this weren't strange enough, Dwight Yoakam and Glenn Howerton both appear in supporting roles. Across a double-feature running time just one minute shy of three hours, you will feel like you have lived several lives and seen everything that the body can do. I hope you live to tell the tale. Ed Luker Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, 1981) + Oedipus Rex (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1967) The displaced traverse the desert in search of a miraculous escape. Sex, violence, politics, secularization, and modernity: the thematic correspondences between Pasolini’s second historical epic and George Miller’s 1980s sci-fi dystopia are clear. Rex and Max, two tight-lipped anti-heroes, two scorched landscapes and the mobs struggling within them. I wasn’t a fan of George Miller’s Mad Max reboot. Like a video game, the logic was simple enough to hang a visual language around—but gimmicks prioritized franchise over storytelling. They go somewhere. They come back. So what? The passing of Fredric Jameson saw a handwritten list for his course “World Film: The Road Movie” circulating on social media. I was surprised, then, to see Miller’s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) at the bottom, after Godard’s Weekend (1967). Miller’s sequel to his original is fantastic. The thematics of displacement and threat are conjured beautifully in a desert without direction. The wanderers are lost. The acts of theft and murder, ritual and prayer, in these wide-angled landscapes of skirmish reminded me of Pasolini’s Moroccan shots. Two films about sovereignty in the desert: the shift from a world of kings to one of leadership without authority. Ecocide and mob rule, road movies for when we’re rapidly running out of road. Carson Lund Evil Does Not Exist (Ryusuke Hamaguchi, 2023) + The Bed You Sleep In (Jon Jost, 1993) Having seen these two films within a week of one another by chance, I was struck by their remarkable similarities to the point of speculating on the possibility that Hamaguchi—a newly crowned Oscar winner who’s quite clearly ambivalent about the honor—might have found direct influence from a fellow filmmaker in voluntary exile from the fanfare of the United States. Set in an Oregon logging community, Jost’s earlier film is a rumination on rape in its environmental and human forms, a caustic and angry work that recognizes that tackling the complexity of such uncomfortable topics cannot be approached from a single expressive mode, and correspondingly vacillates between rigorous documentary observation, Bergmanesque chamber drama, scenes of stilted monologuing that recall the work of Straub-Huillet, and passages of psychedelically inflected structuralist cinema. Threading it all together is a plaintively beautiful modern classical score by Erling Wold that seems to exist on a plane above the action. In a moment of escalating tension near the film’s end, Jost layers a Wold piece over the duration of an image of trees reflected on the windshield of a moving car, a shot that runs long enough to achieve drone-like intensity, redirecting the mounting dramatic stakes toward an attentiveness to the indifferent, but nonetheless vulnerable, natural world. A similar shot functions as a prelude to Hamaguchi’s thorny follow-up to Drive My Car (2021), another formally shape-shifting parable about the deleterious effects of human actions on the land we occupy. In this case, Eiko Ishibashi’s taut, string-laced music overscores a protracted dolly shot focused on the tops of trees in a forest outside Tokyo, the site of both a small rural community and a cynical startup company’s planned glamping business. The shot is echoed at the end of the film when the film’s hitherto muted conflicts unexpectedly explode to a point of violent catharsis—a dramatic pattern discernible in Jost’s film as well. In resorting to such extravagant narrative crescendos, both filmmakers argue that the latent but omnipresent tensions in our modern landscape between nature and human actions—simmering for the most part below the surface to all but the most conscientious ecologists and artists—may only achieve a semblance of resolution suddenly and brutally. At first, I was taken aback by gestures that appeared to be out of tune with the overarching contemplation of both films, and in hindsight, I’m in awe of the political gravity faced head-on by Jost and Hamaguchi. Both films are like boulders hurled into the placid surface of a pond. Saffron Maeve Stress Positions (Theda Hammel, 2024) + Next Stop, Greenwich Village (Paul Mazursky, 1976) Zoé Maghamès Peters Outrun (Nora Fingscheidt, 2024) + American Honey (Andrea Arnold, 2016) Carly Mattox Kneecap (Rich Peppiatt, 2024) + Song of Granite (Pat Collins, 2017) Kneecap begins at breakneck speed, with narrator Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh (known by his stage name Mo Chara, as member of the titular hip-hop group) declaring: “You know what? Every fucking story about Belfast starts like this.” Cue a montage of car bombs and gunfire, emblematic images of the Troubles. It was tempting, of course, to pair Kneecap with such a film—In the Name of the Father (1993) came to mind, as well as Hunger (2008), with Steve McQueen’s latest currently in awards consideration. However, I’ve gone with Pat Collins’s Song of Granite (2017), about the Connemara-born folk musician Joe Heaney who specialized in traditional sean-nós singing. The films are aesthetic opposites—where Kneecap is explosive and orgiastic, Song of Granite is patient and unassuming—yet both are concerned with the preservation of Irish language through music, as much as the respective protagonists’ own complicated relationships to the land of their fathers. Stephanie Monohan April (Déa Kulumbegashvili, 2024) + Under the Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2013) Both feature women who spend a lot of time driving, luring strange men into their car with the suggestion of an anonymous sexual encounter, as well as (spoiler alert) a strange alien-human life-form wandering the liminal space of an inky black pool. However, I was more struck by the unique sense of dread I felt watching these movies. While their protagonists are very different—an extraterrestrial who entraps men in Scotland and delivers them to her home planet vs. an OBGYN trying to provide safe abortions in rural Georgia—both films articulate a kind of female isolation, and the vulnerability that comes from inhabiting a body that is banal one moment and a site of intense danger the next; danger that can come from pregnancy and childbirth, at the hands of violent men, or with punishment by the state. Alexander Mooney Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Winter Kills (William Richert, 1979) Young idealist against an unfeeling world (featuring old man yells at cloud). Victor Morozov Merman (Ana Lungu, 2024) + Alix's Pictures (Jean Eustache, 1980) On the abusive tenderness of showing someone an image. Adam Nayman Longlegs (Oz Perkins, 2024) + In the Dark (Clifton Holmes, 2000) Cryptic missives left lying around in envelopes are a staple of horror movies, but not all correspondence is created equal. Where the letters in Longlegs prove to be red herrings (the only item on Oz Perkins’s conceptual menu) the anonymous instructions guiding cash-strapped Kim Garrett through Clifton Holmes’s millennial SOV masterwork In the Dark (now available on YouTube) communicate the sadistic, Simon-says sensibility of a gig economy predicated on a willing and profit-motivated enslavement. Perwana Nazif Caught by the Tides (Jia Zhangke, 2024) + Neige (Juliet Berto and Jean-Henri Roger, 1983) Andrew Northrop The Land at Night (Richard Tuohy and Dianna Barrie, 2024) + Razor Blades (Paul Sharits, 1968) Maxwell Paparella A Different Man (Aaron Schimberg, 2024) + The Face Behind the Mask (Robert Florey, 1941) When gobs of Edward’s misshapen flesh melt away to reveal Sebastian Stan, he fakes his death and becomes a real estate agent. Peter Lorre’s Janos has a better excuse for turning to a life of crime: he’s saving up for a new face of his own. Both films wind their way through the parks, theaters, and doctor’s offices of Manhattan toward deliciously tragicomic conclusions about the specious appeal of hopes and dreams. Nicolas Pedrero-Setzer Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (Wes Ball, 2024) + Bye Bye Monkey (Marco Ferreri, 1978) There’s nothing surprising about the fact that people are drawn to the myths, ideas, and architecture surrounding the Roman Empire as the world embraces militarism, machismo, and authoritarianism. Before Trump issued the “Executive Order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” Hitler promoted “Starved Classicism.” The attention Wes Ball awards to the Roman Empire is curious for a film that takes place beyond human history; it suggests that the Planet of the Apes will mirror the Planet of the Humans—a tragedy. In Bye Bye Monkey, an electrician who works at a Roman-themed waxwork museum adopts a baby chimpanzee. The museum, with all its classical idols, goes up in flames. After Ferreri showed 1970s audiences that historical paradigms were meant to burn so primates could fashion new futures for themselves, it’s sad to see Ball regress. Cici Peng The Ballad of Suzanne Césaire (Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich, 2024) + India Song (Marguerite Duras, 1975) Two films about the impossibility of representation performed self-consciously, reflexively, and delicately by their respective lead actresses: Zita Hanrot and Delphine Seyrig. Both contend with the impossibilities of bringing back the past in very different colonial contexts—for Duras, it was impossible to represent her memory of Indochina through a “political film,” a form and framework that she detested. She questioned how a film about a factory worker could possibly show the horror and the disorienting otherness at the same time. Suzanne Césaire destroyed her own writing. As Hanrot proclaims, “We are making a film about someone who does not want to be remembered.” Both filmmakers reject the premise of simply “rediscovering” these women. Instead, they play with forms of opacity and question the obfuscating power of the visible. The splendor of the luscious gardens in Hunt-Ehrlich’s film and the opulent mansion in Duras’s slowly but seductively reveal the disastrous implications of such beauty. Andréa Picard Misericordia (Alain Guiraudie, 2024) + Her Venetian Name in Deserted Calcutta (Marguerite Duras, 1976) With its icy Milanese bourgeois family undone by Terence Stamp’s divine sex appeal, Pasolini’s Teorema (1968) would obviously make a great double bill with Guiraudie’s erotic pastoral thriller, but the restoration of a rarely screened, almost mythical film by Duras rouses corresponding sensations involving ghosts, trespasses, longing and desire, dampness, uncertain returns, and invocations. Tonally like night and day, yet both unearth yearning as irrepressible energy transcending death. Adam Piron Here (Robert Zemeckis, 2024) + Enter the Void (Gaspar Noé, 2009) Both Zemeckis and Noé are known for their elaborate technical experiments that act as their own kind of ballyhoo, but I think these examples of their work are actually wrestling with parallel and seemingly personal anxieties through similar formal gambles. They’re both exercises in fixed perspectives, duration, and non-traditional editing techniques that meditate on displacement, death, and bitterness. You gotta take the shot with the chaser, but I’ll leave it up to the viewers to decide which is which. Olivia Popp Toxic (Saulė Bliuvaitė, 2024) + Naissance des pieuvres (Céline Sciamma, 2007) One grimy summer, two teen girls out of place for different reasons. A codependent girlhood friendship runs amok in these distinct films with fascinatingly similar elements: body dysmorphia, compulsory heterosexuality and its dire overarching consequences, riding two-up on a bicycle, teen bodies injuriously sized up, a sloppy exploratory kiss, uncomfortable moments in locker rooms, underwater swimming sequences, taking public transit together toward an inevitably grim encounter with a much older man, an electronic score, overly stylized intercut dance scenes, mostly absent adults. Rachel Pronger The Outrun (Nora Fingscheidt, 2024) + Blue Black Permanent (Margaret Tait, 1992) A woman gazes out to sea as a storm brews, a dot amongst craggy rocks, waves crashing, winds howling…. The Outrun and Blue Black Permanent are two cine-poems which (largely) sidestep romantic stereotypes to offer rugged but still magical portraits of the Orkney Islands. Both are abstracted autobiographies authored by women with strong ties to the archipelago (Tait, who made her feature film debut at 74 with Blue Black Permanent, and Amy Liptrot, who wrote the book and cowrote the screenplay for The Outrun). Subsequently, both films are rooted by a local’s eye for specificities, channeling the wild majesty of this unique terrain to illustrate the turbulent subjectivities of complicated heroines. These are also two films about generational trauma and an inheritance that may run deeper than human bloodlines—into the birds, into the sea creatures, into the rocks of that brutal coastline, into the vast emptiness of the pitch-black Orcadian night. Caitlin Quinlan The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + An Empty Dream (Yu Hyun-mok, 1965) The erotics of the dental surgery. Thomas Quist The Shrouds (David Cronenberg, 2024) + The Mouth Agape (Maurice Pialat, 1974) That empty signifier—“spiritual sequel”—might actually apply here. Two films united by their exploration of death through the driving impulse of cinema: to give an image to the imageless. But both have shots at the end—each a kind of fleeing away—that suggest the impossibility of death being caught alive by film. Rather, these shots both express the sense that perhaps all cinema can offer (following Jean-Luc Nancy’s belief) is evidence that life goes on. Lucía Requejo Solo qu3r3mos un poco de amor (Raúl Perrone, 2024) + Breve cielo (David José Kohon, 1969) For me, it’s always “boy meets girl.” It doesn’t, but if that formula lacked something, it would be the third presence of the most uncontrollable scenario there is: a city. Cities allow us to create a world within the world, to escape from ourselves, to become strangers, while simultaneously forcing us to let our bodies be affected by the other. Fifty-five years set these two Argentinian films apart, but not much has changed about how to make the city one’s own, whether it’s Buenos Aires or Ituzaingó. Through walking, feeling, and asking questions, even for those who have little or nothing, there is still a way to create a world of its own: by falling in love. Vadim Rizov Grand Tour (Miguel Gomes, 2024) + Lost Horizon (Frank Capra, 1937) It makes sense to pair another soundstage spectacular with my Movie of the Year, and thanks to recent restorations, it’s Capra season. I actually haven’t seen Lost Horizon yet—one of his few big ones I haven't gotten to—so this is a note to myself on how to finish the year. Hopefully the pairing works! Julian Ross exergue - on documenta 14 (Dimitris Athiridis, 2024) + The Thick of It (Armando Iannucci, 2005–12) Robert Rubsam Harvest (Athina Rachel Tsangari, 2024) + Nostalghia (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1983) The death of a world as a death of the world. Nothing persists, everything flows, but (for a few hours) art can bring it back. Nicholas Russell Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + A History of Violence (David Cronenberg, 2005) Similar elements don't necessarily yield similar results. Shyamalan’s work opens out onto a host of different cinematic influences and parallels, and various elements of Trap reminded me of a range of serial-killer/family dramas. In the end, I found myself going back to A History of Violence for the way its common threads with Trap are inverted: The patriarch who leads a double life, in one film embracing his violent nature and in the other trying as hard as possible to hide it. The family destroyed yet paradoxically united by the consequences of the father’s terrible actions. Too, aesthetically, Shyamalan tempers his serial killer’s violence into a matter of narrative backstory rather than rampant onscreen brutality, a thwarted expectation juxtaposed with Cronenberg’s shocking, realistic gore in this early-aughts period that, inclusive of Eastern Promises (2007), utilizes Viggo Mortensen as a reluctant cipher. Rafa Sales Ross A Want in Her (Myrid Carten, 2024) + No Home Movie (Chantal Akerman, 2015) Mothers and daughters and tentative kitchen conversations. Sophia Satchell-Baeza Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) —Paul Éluard Dan Schindel Coreys (Dan Streit, 2024) + Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001) Within the bewildering miasma of modern life, the distance between yourself and a performed persona becomes negligible. Is that other self even a performance, or your dream? Which one is the real you? Is either? Everything solid melts into data, while data congeals into reality. Zach Schonfeld Between the Temples (Nathan Silver, 2024) + Hester Street (Joan Micklin Silver, 1975) Carol Kane's filmography is currently bookended by two wonderful, mordantly funny films about what it means to retain or rediscover your Jewishness in America in the 2020s and 1890s, respectively. Both, coincidentally, by directors with the surname Silver. David Schwartz Megalopolis (Francis Ford Coppola, 2024) + Intolerance (D. W. Griffith, 1916) Grand artistic statements and time-hopping historical spectacles whose genius directors spared no expense, Griffith’s Intolerance was released during the Great War, and Coppola’s years-in-the-dreaming Megalopolis emerged during our present apocalypse. This exhilarating and mind-numbing double feature is not exactly a fantasy; real-life time-and-space hopping presented it to me this May, when I traveled from Cannes—where Coppola’s eagerly anticipated film opened and fizzled—to Rochester, where Intolerance was the opening-night film at the Nitrate Picture Show. Though there was much to admire and enjoy in Megalopolis, its sheer inanity and caricatured characters were deflating. Not only did Griffith’s film hold up much better, it was also much more interesting, especially in its depiction of women. Coppola gave us Aubrey Plaza’s Wow Platinum, but Griffith offered a multitude of complex and contradictory women (“the inhumane spinster, the perverse old queen, the bereft mother, the charity girl, the adulteress, and the prostitute,” as Miriam Hansen listed in a Film Comment essay), and they are the key players in all of the film’s pivotal moments—to the extent that even Jesus Christ feels like a marginal character. As Hansen wrote in 1989, “Intolerance remains Griffith’s most modern film, a film that projects its contradictions forward into our time.” Wow indeed. Pedro Emilio Segura Bernal Direct Action (Ben Russell and Guillaume Cailleau, 2024) + Milestones (Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 1975) Jacques Rivette wrote about Nicholas Ray’s work as follows: “And the real struggle takes place in only one of them, against the interior demon of violence, or of a more secret sin, which seems linked to man and his solitude.” Serge Daney said this about Milestones: “Nothing to see (as said to a crowd to move them away from an accident: there is nothing to see)—nothing in common—nothing to look at. The heterogeneity of the images disregards suture, and off-screen space, that reserve fund of perceptions. An omnipresent camera, continuous speaking, are there for real, and from this—the pattern woven from them—there is no way out. Likewise for the collective, there is nothing to see, nothing to meet. No one sees it and it sees no one.” These texts not only speak about the films they were written for but also resonate deeply with their counterparts. These masterpieces are about heritage, radicality...but more importantly about beauty and despair. Dash Shaw Chicken for Linda! (Chiara Malta and Sébastien Laudenbach, 2024) + Windy Day (Faith & John Hubley, 1968) Two bright, bouncy, airy cartoons with voice performances that are a breath of fresh air. Voices so real and refreshing in contrast to the shouty, annoying voice acting heard in most animations. Both are made by couples. Love! Chris Shields Rumours (Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson, Galen Johnson, 2024) + The Poseidon Adventure (Ronald Neame, 1972) Both films play out their dire disaster narratives inside little worlds. In Rumours, the nighttime forestscape where its action is set is psychically insular, created with light and darkness and the knowledge that everyone else has seemingly disappeared. In The Poseidon Adventure, Hackman and his gang of survivors traverse an obstacle course-cum-“Wonderland” in the bowels of a capsized cruise ship. Dream logic (or at least dream scenarios) prevails explicitly and implicitly in both. They are true and strong works of fantasy cinema in that they approach their imaginative and surreal conceits with the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other pragmatism that photographic art makes possible. Superficially, Rumours appears to riff on Poseidon, essentially parodying Irwin Allen’s blockbuster disaster film formula, but at their core, their missions are the same. The limited horizons their chosen scenarios impose serve to only heighten the intensity of their emotional drama. Their settings become a jungle gym for children at play as we watch them create a collective fantasy. Michael Sicinski Eight Postcards from Utopia (Radu Jude and Christian Ferencz-Flatz, 2024) + Kubasa in a Glass: The Strange World of the Winnipeg Television Commercial (1975–1993) (Matthew Rankin and Walter Forburg, 2006) You can look at these two films as different volumes from the same essential project: a cultural history derived from a close analysis of industrial media detritus. The more distance we gain from these artifacts, the more painfully the reveal a nation's neuroses.

Josh Slater-Williams I Saw the TV Glow (Jane Schoenbrun, 2024) + A Snake of June (Shinya Tsukamoto, 2002) There is still time to become the person you're afraid to reveal. Christopher Small Jawan (Atlee Kumar, 2023) + Princess Mononoke (Hayao Miyazaki, 1997) Now that I’ve been submitting these double-feature ballots for more than a decade, I hope I’ve earned enough credit from you, dear reader, to forgive the indulgence of this year’s pairing. The two movies I have picked simply stand in for the year’s most significant cine-events for me personally. First, Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s latest gonzo mega-hit, for spending a day and a half in the presence of the man himself in Locarno, going from a photoshoot to a lunch to the introduction to Devdas (2002). For the other SRK-heads out there, you can perhaps imagine how mind-blowing that whole experience was, also for seeing the workings of unimaginable fame up close. And second, Miyazaki's masterpiece, for my once-in-a-lifetime trip to Yakushima, the island off the coast of Japan that inspired it. Both movies—Atlee’s and Miyazaki’s—are audience-friendly, left-ish political epics involving peasant uprisings, about heroic figures partnering with mythic forces to do battle against the extractive elites whose power ensnares a population. Miyazaki’s is certainly the more artful of the two, his totalizing vision bringing every flutter of an arrow, every quiver of a blade of grass, every chirp of a forest creature to life (and it was the first Studio Ghibli film to blend hand-drawn animation with computer-generated imagery). As I hiked and drove through the forests of Yakushima, these images were with me in my mind’s eye, as Joe Hisaishi’s soundtrack was in my ear. The landscape was freighted with extra significance as I imagined Miyazaki making the same treks, conceiving of Mononoke’s images. Jawan is, let’s say, complementary to Miyazaki’s exacting artistry in that it has little time for niceties of form or craft. Unusually for SRK, it was directed by a Tamil filmmaker, Atlee, who brings a welcome vulgarian-populist madness to the proceedings. As with all the best Indian blockbusters, Jawan is six or seven movies smushed into one, each with its own moral philosophy and genre conventions to play with: the fun is in seeing all of them rub shoulders in such gloriously entertaining fashion. Laura Staab Emit a Beam, See a Light (Amy Halpern, 2022) + The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo (Margaret Tait, 1955) I kept thinking about a book by Anahid Nersessian this year, often returning to what she has to say about beauty in times of misery. She writes that “finding things to call beautiful” in these times “is indefensible,” but we do, all the same, because that is living. And I found things to call beautiful in these two films by Amy Halpern and Margaret Tait. Images of women’s faces, illuminated in warm sunlight—yet seeming, simultaneously, to emit a beam entirely of their own—left me rhapsodic, despite everything. Hannah Strong Queer (Luca Guadaganino, 2024) + Love Is The Devil (John Maybury, 1998) Transactional romance, artistic license, queerness, addiction—and Daniel Craig as the beating, drug-addled heart of it all. Elissa Suh Vulcanizadora (Joel Potrykus, 2024) + End of Night (Keith McNally, 1990) Savage meditations on the realities and pressures of fatherhood. Juvenile regression as a means to avoid responsibility. Scout Tafoya Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (George Miller, 2024) + Wild Boys of the Road (William Wellman, 1933) Depression era fables, tough guys, tomboys, bad cops, lost limbs. “There’s no hope here!” The past and the future caught up to each other. Drag race over, no winners. Matthew Thrift Hard Truths (Mike Leigh, 2024) + Cracking Up (Jerry Lewis, 1983) “Warren, when did you first notice you were…a misfit?” the psychiatrist asks Jerry Lewis’s depressed putz in Cracking Up. He might ask the same of Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s Pansy, the rancorous centre of Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths. Here’s a pair of films that seem to literalize Edward Said’s characterization of late style as being suffused with intransigence and difficulty: two venomous comedies—in the oldest sense of the term—that revolve around the parade of self-manifested indignities suffered by their respective protagonists. Lewis’s film begins with a thwarted suicide attempt and ends with him dousing himself in gasoline. A running joke sees him repeatedly punched in the face. For the irredeemably paranoid Pansy, even the affections of her nearest and dearest are weaponized and booby-trapped. If Leigh counterpoints the chaos of Pansy’s worldview with the gentle empathy of his camera, such separation is impossible for Lewis’s masochistically ungovernable director-star. A discordant symphony of self-flagellation, Lewis’s final masterwork flips the bird to Chaplin’s wounded suggestion in Limelight (1952) that the world might be through with clowns. Katie Tobin Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975) In which we follow sex workers navigating the monotony of their daily lives, desperate to escape the routines that both define and constrain them. Matene Toure Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat (Johan Grimonprez, 2024) + Lumumba (Raoul Peck, 2000) Matt Turner Werckmeister Capybaras (@bartlebooth45, 2024) + Capybaras Walking (Eadweard Muybridge, 1887) An Electro Photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements. Amalia Ulman Afternoons of Solitude (Albert Serra, 2024) + The Moment of Truth (Francesco Rosi, 1965) In 1960s Spain there was a subgenre of movies akin to those made for rockstars (like The Beatles’ HELP!, 1965) but about bullfighters because they were the rockstars of Francoist Spain. Most of these films were insufferable propaganda vehicles but The Moment of Truth got away with a grittier neorealist style due to the fact that it was a foreign production. While both films follow real matadors, The Moment of Truth shows us the historical context of a bullfight, the backstory of its protagonist and the behind the scenes of an industry run by greedy managers, while Afternoons of Solitude is an intimate portrait of both the bull and the matador in the arena during the nerve-wracking moments directly before, during, and after a corrida. Carlos Valladares Marianne (Michael Rozek, 2023) + Abigail's Party (Mike Leigh, 1977) Two anti-Hollywood masterpieces in which a living room opens up as a space for a new possible relation between the self and his family, the self and her society. Leigh has been a major, unfurling discovery for me this year, particularly his BBC work, and this bitter-couples-fighting chamber piece (better than Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, 1966) keeps finding thrilling ways to show how our convenience devices, our passive-aggression, our unhappiness with the way things are (in 1970s England or today) has kept us frighteningly limited in our thinking. Under Rozek's direction, Isabelle Huppert provides a possible expansion to that thinking; she gives, alongside her other equally stunning performance in Hong Sang-soo's A Traveler’s Needs (2024), probably her quintessential performance. And in Marianne—a fresh-feeling, sly, lovely single-hander—she cheerfully sends up the very notion of characters, narrative propulsion, and relatability that Hollywood convinces us is necessary. I feel closer to people after seeing Leigh's work and Marianne. Winnie Wang Lázaro at Night (Nicolás Pereda, 2024) + Isabella (Matías Piñeiro, 2020) K. F. Watanabe Israel Palestine on Swedish TV 1958–1989 (Göran Hugo Olsson, 2024) + Red Army / PFLP: Declaration of War (Masao Adachi and Koji Wakamatsu, 1971) Not a particularly inspired pairing, but it's not been an inspiring year. Maybe next year, God willing. C. Mason Wells Ricky Stanicky (Peter Farrelly, 2024) + Switch (Blake Edwards, 1991) High-concept hijinks, high art. Blake Williams Twisters (Lee Isaac Chung, 2024) + cinéma concret (Takashi Makino, 2015) Two expansions of cinema, in 4DX (Chung) and Pulfrich 3D (Makino), both signaling a return to a primal cinema, both resulting in a dimensional vortex of whirling matter, memories, and mayhem that asks us to feel as though we’re inside the movie while implicitly reminding us of the great relief and tragedy that we'll never be in it for real. Andrew Norman Wilson www.RachelOrmont.com (Peter Vack, 2024) + Analife (Goda Kenji, 2005) A glib summary may leave one with the impression that these makers are antisocial edgelords, and that this pairing is the work of yet another. But both works confronted me with surprising emotional reckonings that, while bleakly reflecting and exaggerating the ways in which media environments capitalize on the lossy compression of emotions into data, also offer visions of escape. That may sound like a Black Mirror episode with a cathartic finale, but Vack and Goda are perceptive enough to understand that, in terms of form, degenerate times call for degenerate measures. If Analife is like getting locked inside the fetish porn room at a sex shop in which an array of screens are stuck on looping DVD menus, www.RachelOrmont.com is like getting airdropped into a memelord's phone. Both offer ways out—Goda leads his trio into the forest, while Vack releases his protagonist (played brilliantly by his sister, Betsey Brown) onto the street. What's so profound about Vack's film is the aesthetic and emotional expansion that unfurls once Rachel is decoupled from the dopamine machine, and what's so heartbreaking is that she can't fathom anything beyond jacking back into it. Madeleine Wulfahrt Anora (Sean Baker, 2024) + Klute (Alan J. Pakula, 1971) Two very different sex-work sagas in two very different New Yorks, both of which somehow manage to dodge the bullet of overt moralization. Watch in chronological order for cinematic gentle-giant progression: from Donald Sutherland's Klute, to Yura Borisov's Igor. Keva York Coreys (Dan Streit, 2024) + Dream a Little Dream (Marc Rocco, 1989) Two tales of two Coreys, a dissociation double feature. Genevieve Yue The Substance (Coralie Fargeat, 2024) + Mediums (James N. Kienitz Wilkins, 2017) Pick me: being chosen can feel like the hand of fate (Elisabeth’s car crash and subsequent encounter with a Substanced nurse) or getting caught in the rusty gears of democracy (potential jurors milling outside a courthouse). In both cases, there’s much to learn, and even more instruction on offer: at-home medical procedures, ass-boosting squats, franchising a Dunkin’ Donuts, French cooking, selecting an insurance plan. After what happens for the sake of, let’s face it, a pretty dull and repetitive job in The Substance, jury duty doesn’t seem so bad after all. Kit Zauhar Trap (M. Night Shyamalan, 2024) + A Man Escaped (Robert Bresson, 1956) I feel as though this is obvious for many reasons, haha! I was pretty obsessed with A Man Escaped in college after watching it in a film class, and was also pretty obsessed with Trap after seeing it in Philly in the old Ritz Theatre with a mouse scuttling around that scared the bejesus out of me every few seconds. I just find watching a character work through the epiphany of an escape plan in real time so deeply satisfying, so why not do it twice?

Title: CFOs Are Paid More, But Have Less Job Security

Plus: Signet Jewelers CFO Talks About Her Strategy To Boost Top Line Growth, Rate Cut Is Likely This Week, SoftBank Makes Huge U.S. Investment Pledge, A Tax Deductible Executive Security Plan The CFO’s role is becoming more important to the company overall. In recent years, CFOs have played a more active role in creating strategy for the company overall, not just tallying up the funds but devising new programs, structures and tech investment plans to help the company’s bottom line. A new study from Datarails finds that average CFOs are becoming better compensated for their work. The average CFO salary, from an analysis of SEC filings for 1,657 publicly traded U.S. companies, was $3.8 million in 2023, up 9% from 2022 and one of the highest in the C-suite. CEOs and CTOs are the only positions that make more, with the average CTO salary only slightly more at $3.9 million. But the CFO also has the worst job security in the C-suite. In the last five years, the average CFO was at a company for only 3.1 of them. Datarails found that 48% of the companies it included in the study—771—had at least one CFO turnover in the last five years. Twenty-two had four CFOs in five years, while 152 had three. Breaking it down by industry, the average utility company CFO is there just over two and a half years. “The CFO position has become less a destination and more a crucible,” the report says. “Success can launch careers to new heights.” And that is true for some: The report found 15 CFOs who were promoted to CEO at their company in 2023. And, the report says, this underscores the new power of the CFO’s position. While it can have tenuous security, it’s a real opportunity for leaders to be forged, proving their acumen in both finance and strategy, and eventually rising to the top. Joan Hilson, chief finance and operating officer of Signet Jewelers, knows all about building strategy to drive better operations and sales. After coming to the world’s largest diamond retail company in 2019 as part of a strategic overhaul, she reformulated the financial and operational arm of the company to operate better in today’s consumer reality. I talked to her about these moves, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Forbes CFO will be taking time off for the holiday season. This is our last newsletter of 2024. We’ll be back in your inbox on Tuesday, January 7. Happy holidays! The Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., where the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee are headquartered. In the run-up to the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting of the year, which begins today, indicators have been mixed. Inflation remains sticky, with last month’s consumer prices 2.7% above where they were in November 2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month. Core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—was 3.3% higher than a year ago. The CPI met analysts’ expectations, though it’s a tenth of a percentage point higher than October’s 2.6% inflation rate—but both are above the 2% Federal Reserve target. These figures show a high likelihood that the Fed will cut its target interest rate for the third straight time since September. According to CME FedWatch, 97% of economists predict a quarter percentage point cut, down to 4.25%. While the rate cut trend has continued, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that in 2025, the trend may slow down, especially if inflation doesn’t start coming down more. Inflation is only one piece of the puzzle—job growth and the overall economy are also taken into account—but persistent inflation held interest rates at the two-decade high of 5.25% for more than a year. The stock market had a big week as well, with the Nasdaq composite exceeding 20,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday. The inflation report, as well as big tech stocks and AI confidence, buoyed the market rally, and the index again exceeded 20,000 on Tuesday morning. But all companies did not have a good week. Chipmaker Nvidia found itself in correction territory Monday, posting a more than 1.6% loss—11% below its all-time closing high of $149 on November 7. While nothing new happened with Nvidia on Monday, the continued dip may be residual hesitancy based on Chinese authorities announcing last week an antitrust investigation into Nvidia for issues stemming from its 2020 acquisition of Israel’s Mellanox Technologies, writes Forbes senior contributor Dan Runkevicius. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside President-elect Donald Trump and his choice for Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan’s SoftBank announced a huge investment in the U.S. on Monday. At a joint event with President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son announced the tech funder would invest $100 billion in the United States over the next four years, doubling the $50 billion investment SoftBank made during Trump’s first term. Son said the investment will bring about 100,000 jobs in AI and related industries to the U.S. “President Trump is a double down president, I’m going to have to double down,” Son said at the joint press conference. However, Forbes’ Richard Nieva notes there could be an issue with that commitment: SoftBank doesn’t have $100 billion right now. Its market cap is close—$97 billion as of Monday, Nieva writes—and the commitment is for investments over four years, meaning there is time for SoftBank’s funds to grow. SoftBank’s commitment comes on the heels of many Big Tech executives kowtowing to the president-elect—and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all announcing $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund. Police place bullet casing markers outside the hotel in New York City after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot December 4. Since the shooting death earlier this month of United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson as he walked into the annual Investor Day meeting in New York City, C-suites and boardrooms have been buzzing about executive security. While some companies have taken immediate measures like removing executive pictures and profiles from their websites, others are beginning to look at actual security details to protect the executives—something that just over a quarter currently have. But executive security is a costly proposition. Last year, Apple spent $820,300 on personal security for CEO Tim Cook, as well as $1.6 million on his private aircraft travel, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. However, she writes, there are ways for companies to get tax breaks on executive security. According to tax law, essential security measures for an executive—those provided in response to “bona fide business-oriented security concerns” that are provided as part of a plan pursuant to independent security studies—can be deducted by the company. (The SEC considers executive security to be reportable compensation, so they are disclosed.) Signet Jewelers Chief Financial and Operating Officer Joan Hilson. The fine jewelry industry has seen big changes recently, and Joan Hilson has been there to lead the way. Since 2019, she’s been CFO of Signet Jewelers, the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer that is the parent company of Kay Jewelers, Jared, Zales, Blue Nile and Banter by Piercing Pagoda. She was recently promoted to chief financial and operating officer. I spoke to Hilson about how Signet Jewelers’ new strategies, both before and since the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped the company cut costs and increase sales. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. A longer version is available here. When you first came to Signet in 2019, you focused on restructuring the finance department. Why was this important, and how did you do it? Hilson: I joined Signet in 2019, as we were working to transform the overall company. The transformation was cultural, strategic and, at its core, financial. My job was to link arms with our [then-]CEO Gina Drosos and the senior leadership team to be one of the key drivers and an architect of our future growth plans. When I came in as CFO, Gina started to disassemble some of the top-down culture that needed to change. I was excited to dig into the financial side, the forecasting, and bring goals and an understanding of those goals to the team so that they can realize what we needed to achieve to drive a strong framework for our future. We rolled out [strategic plan] “Path to Brilliance” in 2018, and because of the progress we made on those goals, we accelerat[ed] to the “Inspiring Brilliance” strategy, which focused on enhanced capabilities. One of the things that I focused on as the financial leader of the company was: What do we need to do to drive top line growth and recognize that our banners span 80% of U.S. jewelry customers. By focusing on our core banners, we can drive that top line growth, which was critical to our strategies. We also focused on expanding our operating margins. That came along with developing a high-margin jewelry services business, which can take care of all of our customer needs, in terms of love and care for their jewelry. Along with that, we focused on a cost-savings initiative that drove out costs over $900 million since 2019. We did that by not just focusing on cutting costs that the customer doesn’t see or care about, but by changing processes and understanding how to simplify and what’s important to the overall growth of our business. Those efficiencies included the labor scheduling model we have in our stores. We have over 2,500 stores. With investments in data and analytics, we were able to bring forward labor scheduling models that enabled the strongest jewelry consultants to be in the stores at peak hours. We were able to look at locations by hour and by jewelry consultant to understand the best productivity opportunities. Our sales per labor hour is a key metric. [It] was up more than 40% versus pre-pandemic. It was a huge improvement in leveraging analytics and labor scheduling to serve our customers ultimately in a better way. The next big focus was our real estate strategy. Over my tenure, we closed over 1,000 stores. We did reopen stores in optimal locations for our business, but the net was a 630 [store] closure. It improved our gross margin leverage by 400 basis points by optimizing our fleet and then putting stores in the right locations within markets. We also moved from in-mall to off-mall to better serve some of the smaller markets in the U.S. While doing that, the savings that we were able to achieve we invest[ed] in our digital capabilities. With this change, we were able to grow our e-commerce business significantly over the five years from 2019. We went from 5% penetration to 20% penetration. We brought Signet into the digital and technology world and proved that jewelry and high-price-point items can be purchased online. In general, consumer spending across many categories has been down for about the last year and a half. How has Signet made it through that? We have a value-oriented consumer and they are looking for a value in whatever they purchase. We brought an assortment that can speak to the different economic circumstances of our customers. We have a portfolio that spans from Banter by Piercing Pagoda to Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile at the accessible luxury end of our business. Within each of those banners, we have good, better, best price points based on overall design and content of precious metals. We’ve addressed it with assortment architecture and bringing our customers price points that serve wherever they are at that time of year or their circumstance.

Title: Weight loss drugs are getting people to the doctor. Now comes the wave of long-ignored diagnoses

Time Published: 2024-12-17T16:15:00Z

Popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are boosting the use of healthcare in the U.S., leading to an uptick in patients getting diagnosed and starting prescriptions for other conditions, according to a new analysis by health data firm Truveta. The firm analyzed thousands of electronic patient records between 2020 and 2024 and found a noticeable bump in first-time diagnoses of sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes just days after a patient started a prescription for a GLP-1 weight-loss drug. These drugs are bringing people who previously avoided medical care into the doctor’s office. In partnership with Truveta, Reuters interviewed a number of patients and physicians who said that some overweight patients seeking GLP-1s treatments have been hesitant to visit a doctor or go in for routine tests for years due to “stigma and bias they often encounter.” Because of this, once they do finally go to a doctor seeking a GLP-1 prescription these patients also end up getting diagnosed with other obesity-related conditions. Truveta researchers found that for every 1,000 patients with a first-time GLP-1 prescription in 2024, 42 ended up getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within 15 days, compared with 32 in 2020. During the same period, the number of sleep apnea diagnoses per 1,000 patients rose to 11 from 8, while the number of cardiovascular disease diagnoses jumped to 15 from 13. Even a medical device maker attributed their revenue growth this year in part to the rise of GLP-1 drugs. ResMed (RMD), a seller sleep of apnea devices, said its revenue rose 11% during its fiscal year ending in June. The company’s CEO, Michael Farrell, told investors in a recent meeting that GLP-1 drugs are “bringing people into primary care like never before.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) diabetes drug Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Popular brands on the market also include Ozempic’s sister drug Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these meds has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Tuesday despite upbeat retail sales data as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting expected to usher in an interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.7%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Markets are waiting for Fed policymakers to kick off their final gathering of the year, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares fell over 2% in late morning trade. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade" per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz writes: "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.5%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5%. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday. November retail sales grew at a faster pace than Wall Street analysts had expected, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer and indicating that the holiday shopping season in the US is off to a strong start. Retail sales rose 0.7% in November. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in October were revised up to a 0.5% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. A 2.4% month-over-month increase in motor vehicle and auto parts sales, as well as a 1.8% increase in online sales, drove the gains. November sales, excluding auto and gas, rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. The control group in Tuesday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the Gross Domestic Product reading for the quarter, increased by 0.4%, in line with estimates.

Title: My favourite VR headset from 2024 just got its first major price cut, and it's not the one you think

Just in time for Christmas - and you get three free games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta Quest 3S and Apple Vision Pro sure have hogged the VR limelight this year, but there's another headset that I think you should know about if you're shopping for a new mixed-reality device this Christmas. The Pico 4 Ultra launched only a few months ago, and it has some specs that are even more powerful than the Meta Quest 3. I was scrolling through Christmas-time deals at Amazon today when I came across its first-ever major discount - to the tune of a £60 reduction. That means that for a limited time, you can get the Pico 4 Ultra for just £469 at Amazon, which is the same price as the 512GB Quest 3. Because this VR headset is so new, the discount isn't all you get. You can still make the most of the Pico 4 Ultra's launch bundle, which gets you three free games (try saying that a few times out loud) with your purchase for no extra cost. Those games are packing serious heat: Blade & Sorcery, Pistol Whip, and Synth Riders, as well as a one-month subscription to VRChat Plus. That's quite tempting versus the one free Batman game you get when buying the Quest 3. Pico 4 Ultra 256GB + 3 Free Games + VRC+ Subscription | £529 £469 at AmazonSave £60 - This is the first time that the Pico 4 Ultra has dropped in price since its launch earlier in the year. Its pre-order bonus offer is still available, which means you can get three free games with your purchase, two of which are Blade & Sorcery and Pistol Whip, which are two of the best VR games ever made in my opinion. Buy it if ✅ You want a powerful standalone VR headset✅ You want something that's better than the Meta Quest 3✅ You want to play on PC✅ You want three free games to get you started Don't buy it if: ❌ You'd prefer a Meta Quest headset❌ You already own a PS5 Now priced at the same level as the Meta Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra finds itself in a straight shootout. I've had the good fortune of reviewing both headsets and although both are plenty capable of giving you mixed reality goodness and VR gaming fun, there's one I'd probably choose over the other. Pico 4 Ultra has 12GB of RAM, more than the 8GB you get in the Meta Quest 3. In addition, it has a really lightweight feel on your head because the head strap you get out of the box is a bit more substantial than the stock one Meta gives you. This spreads the weight a bit better, meaning it's more comfortable to wear for longer sessions. One of my biggest concerns with Pico's OS was that it might have a smaller library of games than the popular Quest options. While that is true, I was surprised that the 4 Ultra still had access to lots of great titles, and many of the best VR games are present. In standalone mode, the Pico 4 Ultra uses the same processor as the Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, but with its beefier memory, larger battery, faster Wi-Fi, and crystal clear frontal cameras, I'd probably pick the Pico 4 Ultra. You may think the opposite is true when you consider the Quest 3's increased 512GB storage or slightly wider field of view, but I'd disagree. Memory makes more of a difference to gaming performance in a VR headset, and a longer battery life will be a big factor for you. VR games are bizarely small in terms of storage sizes, and in over a year of owning my Quest 3, I've not come close to filling up its 512GB drive. Of course, if you're on a budget, you might want to opt for the cheapest alternative, which will be the Meta Quest 3S. It also shares the same chipset as the headsets above, although does cut some corners with other internal specs. Still, it only costs £299, so if you need to keep costs down at this time of year (I wouldn't blame you), that headset might suit you better.

Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands.

Title: AppLovin has rocketed to a $100 billion valuation. Some industry insiders are skeptical its run can last.

Time Published: 2024-12-17T15:43:04Z
Full Content:
Shares in the mobile ads and gaming company AppLovin have been running wild — and advertising industry insiders have a lot of questions. AppLovin entered the Nasdaq 100 in November, with its market value surpassing the $100 billion milestone and shares up more than 780% so far this year. It's a remarkable ascent for any company, but especially for one that had flown fairly under the radar until recently, even within the ad industry itself. At its current valuation, AppLovin dwarfs even The Trade Desk, long considered adtech's star performer, which has a market capitalization of around $65 billion. AppLovin — which helps app developers make money through advertising and find new users through ads — has grown its share to 42% of the mobile gaming market, per analysts at Piper Sandler. But there's one key new development that's driving its stunning stock run: e-commerce. Bullish analysts say AppLovin has room to grow further and do for e-commerce marketers what it has for gaming companies, taking on Meta in the process. "In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot," AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi said of the company's new e-commerce product on an earnings call last month. With its stock riding high, some industry insiders also think AppLovin could make a transformative acquisition that would make it a household name. Still, others in the ad industry say AppLovin's business model deserves some skepticism amid its meteoric rise. 22V Research analyst John Roque wrote in a recent note that AppLovin was the most overbought stock in the Russell 3000. AppLovin declined to comment on a list of detailed questions about its business. Wall Street's interest in AppLovin soared this year as the company unveiled a plan to go after a new target customer outside the mobile gaming community: e-commerce advertisers. The move opened up a total addressable ad revenue opportunity of around $120 billion, two to three times the size of the $40 to $50 billion mobile games user acquisition market, according to Macquarie Equity senior analyst Tim Nollen. Nollen recently raised the firm's target share price for AppLovin to $450 from $270, citing its e-commerce push. Cody Pfloker, chief marketing and revenue officer for Jones Road Beauty, which is testing AppLovin, said direct-to-consumer advertisers are excited by the prospect of a new player in the market. "Meta has been the dominant customer acquisition channel for brands and while other platforms have come up like TikTok a few years ago, none are either as efficient or scalable," Pfloker said. "Nothing has been able to dethrone Meta." AppLovin says it can reach a potential audience of 1.4 billion daily active users across mobile apps and connected-TV devices — an audience comparable to Meta or Google's apps. Pfloker said part of the appeal is that e-commerce advertisers can easily repurpose their Meta ads into ads for AppLovin's mobile games and other apps. AppLovin is only inviting e-commerce advertisers that spend upward of $20,000 a day on Meta ads to try its product, and it's incentivizing some of those buyers with $10,000 ad credits, multiple industry insiders told BI. They, like some others in this story, requested anonymity to preserve business relationships; their identities are known to BI. Prescient AI, a marketing measurement company, ran an analysis in October that found AppLovin delivered a 1.5 times higher return on ad spend for its customers than Meta and Google Adwords, on average. "A pretty startling thing is happening," said Will Holtz, VP of strategy and operations at Prescient AI. The top spenders are spending 25% to 30% of their budgets on AppLovin, he said, something Prescient hasn't seen before on a new channel, except for something like TV where people bulk up spending over the holidays. What's more, Holtz added: "They're spending incremental dollars; they're not just shifting budget away from channels like Meta." It's worth noting that the ads are full-screen and can't be skipped, which also likely boosts some performance metrics compared to other platforms. The results are also early and could fluctuate as more advertisers come on board. Despite the enthusiasm from some customers, others in the digital ad community have raised concerns about AppLovin. Some industry insiders attribute AppLovin's performance to its cornering of every part of the mobile app ad transaction. AppLovin operates AppDiscovery, the technology that advertisers use to buy the ads; the MAX mediation technology developers use to sell their ads; and the ALX exchange that connects the two. It also has Adjust, its ad measurement platform, and AXON, an AI engine designed to improve the performance of its ads. This could give AppLovin a unique view of the market and allow it to see what different advertisers and buying platforms are bidding. Theoretically, AppLovin could use this intelligence to refine its own ad bidding strategies. "It's one company for monetizing your app, growing your userbase, and then grading its own homework," a mobile ad veteran told BI. "They say there's a firewall and 'we don't talk,' but it's hard to prove otherwise." If that sounds familiar, it's because it's similar to how people often describe the approach that helped Google dominate advertising on the web. A judge in Google's adtech antitrust trial is currently weighing whether that strategy, as well as its use of other auction tactics, amounted to Google operating an illegal monopoly. Google denies this and has said the adtech market is fiercely competitive and that its innovations have brought benefits to consumers, publishers, and advertisers. Jeromy Sonne, the founder of marketing AI technology company Simbiant, has been monitoring the early AppLovin e-commerce results. He said he'd seen an "extremely high correlation" between when AppLovin sees a spike in conversions and when Meta sees an increase in ad spend. He said he hadn't seen a similar trend when comparing Meta and Google or AppLovin and Google. He said that made him wonder if AppLovin was driving real incremental value or whether its campaigns were just reaching the exact same audience as Meta in some way. He said he'd also seen a "concerning overlap" where Shopify sales purportedly driven by AppLovin have a very high geographic overlap with where Meta ad website traffic was coming from. Separately, Prescient AI's analysis found that brands spending between 25% to 30% of their digital ad budgets on AppLovin acquired fewer incremental new customers than brands in the 5% to 10% range. While reacquiring some old customers isn't necessarily a bad thing, the finding raises questions about the appropriate level of spending advertisers should devote to AppLovin, Prescient AI's Holtz said. Other advertisers have questioned why AppLovin doesn't share granular data about exactly where their ads ran. "It's a little bit of a black box — we have no idea where our ads are appearing," Pfloker said of AppLovin. "There's a lot to be excited about, but there's a lot to be skeptical about." AppLovin recently paid more than $150 million to add developer Zynga's portfolio of games to its MAX ad exchange as part of Zynga's divestment of its adtech platform Chartboost, three people familiar with the matter told BI. This boosted AppLovin's already huge audience of gamers. A spokesperson for Zynga owner Take-Two declined to comment. Some in the industry think AppLovin could make an even bigger move. The company recently sold $3.5 billion in bonds, which Bloomberg reported were to pay down debt "and for general corporate purposes." Could that include an acquisition? Alex Merutka, an early AppLovin employee who now runs his own digital marketing company, Craftsman+, thinks AppLovin should make a bid for a social network — a particularly valuable sector of apps because users tend to be logged in, visit often, and share useful data. People who use mobile games don't usually hand over data like phone numbers or email addresses, vital pieces of information for marketers to help connect their ads to outcomes, and to retarget users with ads. AppLovin is already trading at a larger market capitalization than Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined. Years ago, Snap held informal, early-stage talks about potentially acquiring AppLovin, a person familiar with the matter told BI. Perhaps the roles could be reversed this time around. While Snap posted a revenue growth bounceback in its latest quarter, it's struggled to keep momentum amid fierce competition from the likes of TikTok. AppLovin could theoretically help optimize Snap's ad platform for performance advertisers to better compete with Google and Meta. "If Adam was in control, Snap could be a $100 billion business — a $200 billion, $300 billion company — and AppLovin would be stronger too," Merutka said, referring to AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. "There's a lot of opportunity there." However, AppLovin execs said onstage at the Nasdaq Investor Conference earlier this month that M&A wasn't a near-term priority and that the company was keeping a close eye on its head count and margins. "It's much harder than people realize, and it's exceptionally hard for a company that's structured like us," Foroughi said of M&A and the difficulty of absorbing different company cultures, according to a transcript provided by the market intelligence platform AlphaSense.

Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Full Content:
LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a rapidly growing space technology company with a market capitalization of nearly $13 billion and impressive 497% stock return over the past six months, has announced the delivery of its second Pioneer spacecraft to Vandenberg Space Force Base and the completion of a third spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc. The company is fulfilling a contract for four vehicles intended to advance commercial manufacturing in space. According to InvestingPro data, Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong revenue growth of 54% over the last twelve months. The Pioneer spacecraft are designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California. They are equipped to support Varda's reentry capsule, which conducts operations in microgravity that are challenging or infeasible on Earth. The spacecraft provide systems for power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control, and are crucial for maneuvering Varda's capsule for reentry to Earth. With a healthy current ratio of 2.58, InvestingPro analysis shows the company maintains strong operational flexibility with liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. Rocket Lab's first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda was launched in 2023 and spent eight months in orbit, enabling the production of ritonavir crystals, a drug used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The successful deorbit and landing of the capsule occurred in Utah in February 2024. The second mission, set for launch in the first quarter of 2025, will involve similar in-space operations and is planned to conclude with a landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia. Rocket Lab's rapid production of the third spacecraft, shortly after the second, showcases its strategy of vertical integration and enhanced satellite production capabilities. This approach aims to optimize schedule and cost efficiency in satellite production. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, emphasized the company's role in setting new standards for rapid, reliable satellite production. Varda CEO and co-founder Will Bruey expressed that the mission represents a move toward frequent reentry operations, aiming to make them as routine as launches. This partnership between Rocket Lab and Varda is part of a broader trend in the commercial space industry, focusing on leveraging the unique conditions of space to benefit various industries on Earth. For investors seeking deeper insights into Rocket Lab's financial health and growth prospects, InvestingPro offers comprehensive analysis with 15+ additional ProTips and detailed metrics in its Pro Research Report, helping investors make informed decisions in the rapidly evolving space sector. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, Rocket Lab USA has successfully conducted a hypersonic technology test for the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed project. The company also received a $23.9 million award from the U.S. Department of Commerce to expand its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. These recent developments have led to an increase in analyst activity. BTIG has maintained a neutral rating on the company's shares, while BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen have all increased their price targets for Rocket Lab, reflecting confidence in the company's growth potential. Rocket Lab reported a 55% year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 2024, totaling $105 million, with Q4 revenue projected to be between $125 million and $135 million. The company's Neutron rocket, a key component of its growth strategy, has reached a new milestone, entering the qualification stage and securing its first commercial launch order. These are just a few of the recent developments that highlight Rocket Lab's ongoing momentum in the aerospace industry. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Every year has its share of PR disasters, headline-grabbing hacks, and puzzling product launches. In 2024, we saw a chip giant struggle for relevance, an AI exec get in over his head, and a faulty software update brick millions of PCs. And let's not forget Elon's antics. Here are some of the top fails from the year and a few honorable mentions for notable 2024 facepalms. This will go down as Intel’s worst year in recent memory. The board booted out CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was once hailed as Intel’s savior. The chip maker was also forced to lay off 15,000 employees. And it’s struggled to respond to demand for AI GPUs, a market Nvidia has been dominating. On top of all this, Intel’s reputation for PC desktop chips took a serious hit after admitting that its “Raptor Lake” processors suffered from a voltage bug capable of damaging the silicon. Although Intel pledged to replace the affected processors, many PC builders flocked to rival AMD and its Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming processor. Here’s hoping Team Blue makes a comeback in 2025; the industry could use more competition in PC chips and graphics cards.—Michael Kan It looks like China has the power to spy on your phone calls, texts, and possibly more. A Chinese-linked hacking group known as “Salt Typhoon” breached at least eight US telecommunications companies in a campaign that’s potentially been going on for two years, according to White House officials. What makes the hack especially disturbing is that Salt Typhoon hackers likely remain in US networks as federal investigators try to uncover the full scope of the scheme. The only good news is that Salt Typhoon is focused on high-profile politicians, including Donald Trump, rather than average Americans. But it could take months or even years for the US to sort out the extent of the hack, and to shore up the country’s telecom networks. —Michael Kan It was never a good idea to allow any company to buy and sell people’s personal data. Unfortunately, the woeful state of data privacy in the US was on full display in 2024 when a little-known background check company called National Public Data lost as many as 272 million Social Security numbers to a hacker. The stolen database, which also included full names, addresses, and dates of birth, was leaked on a hacking forum this summer, giving scammers a valuable trove of data to exploit for identity theft schemes and other kinds of fraud. The company behind National Public Data has since shut down and is facing investigations and class-action lawsuits from across the country. But the damage is done. Millions of Americans now have another reason to worry about their privacy.—Michael Kan In July, we learned just how reliant the world is on a handful of companies in the tech space when cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a faulty kernel-level update. It crashed 8.5 million Windows PCs, which displayed the “blue screen of death” and unleashed global chaos. Over 2,700 flights were cancelled, US border checkpoints had to temporarily ditch their digital systems, FedEx and UPS packages were delayed, Social Security offices and DMVs came to a standstill, and healthcare facilities switched to manual operations. It also delayed some transit systems, caused brief 9-1-1 outages, and took down some payment systems. Delta Air Lines and CrowdStrike shareholders have since sued CrowdStrike over the faulty update. And Microsoft is prepping a Windows “Quick Machine Recovery” mode that will let IT administrators remotely fix a Windows machine even if it's unable to boot.—Kate Irwin At its Build developer conference this spring, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered “Recall” feature for Windows PCs that takes snapshots of your activity so you can easily return to it at a later date. But it prompted concern that Recall could be compromised to expose user data or record passwords and financial data. Microsoft clarified that Recall is stored locally, but it still delayed the launch, beefed up Recall’s settings options, and made the feature opt-in by default for business users. In late November, Microsoft finally launched the feature for Windows 11 Insiders only, to gather feedback and potentially make more tweaks. But failing to address those security concerns upfront was an embarrassing black eye for Redmond.—Kate Irwin The archival Internet Archive platform experienced a DDoS attack in October that may have exposed 31 million users and took down the site for days. And the site didn’t restore full functionality right away when it came back online. A hacker who claimed responsibility for the attack said he did it because the US supports Israel and the Internet Archive is a US site. The hacker also called the US government “horrendous and hypocritical” in a statement. Thankfully, the Internet Archive’s operator, Brewster Kahle, has said that “the data is safe,” but the fact that the DDoS attack took the entire platform offline was an ominous fail that did little to calm concerns about our ability to preserve internet history.—Kate Irwin For a brief moment amid this year’s AI hype, a few startups imagined a new way to use it, and quickly crashed and burned. Rabbit and Humane both developed hardware with an AI-powered voice assistant inside. The idea? Free us from staring at cell phone screens by offering a more intuitive, always-available way to interact with the tech. The devices immediately garnered negative reviews. We gave the Rabbit R1 a 2/5 rating, finding that it couldn’t compete with or replace the widely available smart assistants that are already in our pockets. The Humane AI Pin, meanwhile, was slow to respond in our hands on at MWC, and the company was reportedly looking for a buyer shortly after launch. Apple may have a better shot with its revamped version of Siri, coming in 2026.—Emily Forlini EV owners were blindsided when one of the most popular home charger companies suddenly pulled the plug on its US business in October. EU-based JuiceBox posted a message to its website that basically said: “Sorry, but the hardware installed in your garage will no longer be supported in a few weeks. It’ll still charge the vehicle, but forget about any mobile app monitoring or over-the-air updates. And that public JuiceBox charger in your local grocery store parking lot? That’s just not going to work at all.” After some serious backlash, JuiceBox parent company EnelX signed a deal to prolong software support, but the ordeal underscores how you never truly own a software-defined piece of hardware.—Emily Forlini We don’t typically write about celebrities, but then Sam Altman ticked off Scarlett Johansson. The OpenAI CEO marketed the company’s Voice Mode feature as a real-life version of the 2013 movie Her, in which Johansson plays the voice of an AI named Samantha. But after a May demo of the tech featured a voice that sounded a lot like Johansson, the actress claimed that she declined Altman’s request to train the model on her voice. OpenAI denied using Johansson’s voice; it said it hired a separate voice actor for the role of "Sky." Still, the company disabled that voice option, and Sky was not one of the voice options when Advanced Voice Mode rolled out this fall.—Emily Forlini Days after he announced plans to acquire Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk argued that the platform needed to be “politically neutral” in order for it to “deserve public trust.” This approach, he said, “effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.” In March 2024, he also pledged to not donate to either US presidential candidate, but by July, he’d changed his tune dramatically, swapping neutrality for MAGA hats. “If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win,” Musk tweeted in September. He seized the @America X handle to promote Trump, donated millions to his campaign, shared doctored and misleading clips of VP Kamala Harris, and is now working closely with the president-elect on an effort to cut government spending, which is most certainly a conflict of interest given his government contracts.

Title: Meta Quest 3S review: “Maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created”

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3S isn’t like other Lite hardware, because it actually feels like the flagship Quest 3 and you really need to look to see the differences. This will give most players everything in a VR headset they’ll want, and it’s not going to break the bank like this technology usually does. In short, it continues the mission of the Meta Quest 2 by bringing great standalone gaming, mixed reality, and a huge wealth of games and apps to the masses at a reasonable price point. Approachable price tag Huge library of games A lot of spec similarities with the Quest 3 and… …It actually feels like an affordable Quest 3 Controller tracking isn’t great Battery life is fine Fresnel lenses do feel like a downgrade No audio jack Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. I’m going to level with you and admit that, even for someone like me who has tried a number of different VR headsets through the years, it can be hard to tell the difference between the Meta Quest 3S and its full-fat sibling. Yes, there are a few obvious comparisons you can make, but for their respective prices, the Quest 3S does a very impressive imitation. And that’s a good thing. A lot of the time an “S” device that comes in cheaper than a flagship model feels half-baked because the manufacturer really wants you to spend money on the more expensive version. The Quest 3 is one of the best VR headsets out there at the moment, but it didn’t exactly continue the Quest 2’s mission of making virtual reality technology affordable for all. The Meta Quest 3S remedies that because it comes in two sizes (128GB and 256GB) and costs only $299.99 / £289.99 or $399.99 / £379. That lower MSRP is the same price as the Quest 2 before it was discontinued. Pandemic launch or not, that headset made a name for itself by making a mainstream VR device approachable, and the Quest 3S may see major success for the same reason. Not only does the Meta Quest 3S feel like the proper spiritual successor to the Quest 2, but it sort of looks like one too. It has the same rectangular look with sharper corners that make it look a bit more refined. If it weren’t for an upgraded frontal camera module, the Quest 3S would look eerily similar to the Meta Quest 2. For a “Lite” model of the Meta Quest 3, it does make me laugh that Zuck’s engineers have only managed to shave one measly gram off the Quest 3’s weight. It’s the equivalent of taking a feather out of your inventory in Skyrim and suddenly not being over-encumbered, and it’s hilarious that Meta is actually marketing it for its “lightweight design”. Nice try. The Quest 3S comes with the same cleverly designed head strap as the Quest 3. It’s definitely a basic, stock option, but it does the job with a top velcro strap that can be adjusted to your head size, as well as some loops around the back to tighten or loosen the fit. Thankfully, the design of the Quest 3S has been thoughtfully executed, since the best Meta Quest accessories made for the original will fit either headset - no need to buy specially fitted ones for either device. Out of the box, the facial interfaces of both feel identical, with some fabric upholstery and quite plush cushioning for your cheeks and forehead. It’s no surprise that the Quest 3S connects to a charger or gaming PC through USB-C, although it misses out on the Quest 3’s 3.5mm audio jack, which is a shame. I’m not sure this would cost too much more to add in 2024, and since budget buyers are far more likely to use it than wireless or Bluetooth headsets, it feels like a glaring omission. Thankfully, you get the additional onboard buttons for when your controllers inevitably run out of battery. Some volume adjustment keys and a handy action button lie on the headset’s underside, which should always be present on standalone headsets like this. There’s also the standard power button on the 3S’s left-hand side. Even when you’re looking at the spec sheets comparing the Quest 3 and 3S, you need a trained eye to figure out the differences, because, in truth, there aren’t many. Both feature the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which is one of the biggest wins of this more affordable headset. It’d be all too easy for Meta to scale back on power for the lighter model, but with so much competition in the VR world at the moment, the use of this processor feels like they’re rolling up their sleeves. The Pico 4 Ultra also launched this year, touting that same APU but even more RAM than the Quest 3. Despite Meta’s financial footwork to get around it when the Quest 3S launched, the Pico 4 Ultra is still a serious rival in Europe, so this processor is more important than a lot of shoppers realize. If you think about it, the Quest 3S gets you the processing power of the Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra, and even the new HTC Vive Focus Vision for undeniably cheaper than any of those devices. The latter will set you back $999 / £999, and although it’s designed to harness the power of the best graphics cards, that’s still a massive win for people buying the Quest 3S. The biggest talking point for most is that the Quest 3’s pancake lenses are missing from the Quest 3S. For me, this is perhaps the most noticeable change when using either headset. The wider area of focus really does make a difference in gaming and mixed-reality menu hopping. Combine that with a lower per-eye resolution, and the Quest 3S does start to feel more like a budget option. Still, with the same 8GB of RAM, integrated spatial audio speakers, and variable refresh rate, the Quest 3S has more than enough to make first-time VR buyers swoon. Another spec disparity of note is that the Quest 3 has an integrated depth sensor which can help with passthrough clarity as well as room tracking and mapping. The Quest 3S omits this, instead using a few InfaRed projectors to map out a room and your position in it. I didn’t notice less accurate tracking in my side-by-side tests of the 3 and 3S, but it might be worth taking into consideration if you play in a more sensitive area of your home with lots of breakable goodies near you. Similarly, if you play in darker rooms, the Quest 3’s depth sensor might be better for low-lighting conditions. Battery life is technically better on the Quest 3S, despite its mAh being smaller. Depending on what you use either headset for in one session, you’ll get a similar 2-hour battery life without a pro headstrap. I’ve found just over 2 hours for either is an accurate statement, with gaming being the more intensive activity that brings it down closer to that baseline. Neither is particularly impressive in terms of lifespan because they’re just short enough to feel like an inconvenience. If you don’t charge up between uses, you’re probably going to be cutting your next Power Wash Sim session short. What is constantly disappointing is that the controllers have an even worse battery life, and will often run out of charge between uses. For that reason, I can highly recommend charging docks to keep the controllers ready to go for your next session - unless you have an unlimited budget for AA batteries. I want to state right now that the Quest 3S is a very impressive VR gaming device for the money. Most of the performance notes I have are about the few times I paid attention to the man behind the curtain, noticing where the Quest 3 does things better. That’s probably going to be the case for most “Lite” model reviews because it’s where the natural comparisons are going to sit. That said, it doesn’t mean the Quest 3S isn’t worth buying. I’m really looking for the nitty gritty details I’ll mention below, and I’ll admit that they were quite tricky to find. Normally, I wouldn’t actually compare two devices so closely when they have a two-hundred-dollar price disparity, but the fact I feel those comparisons are valid says a lot of good things about the Quest 3S on its own. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. For the first few weeks of testing this headset, I wasn’t actually sure what I was going to say in this review. Unless I really looked for the slight differences between the 3 and 3S, I couldn’t find them. I could boot up a game and play for hours without any immersion-breaking performance hiccups to give away that I was using a “budget” device. Especially if you’re not used to playing VR games, this headset will be very capable of making your jaw drop. Like the Quest 2 before it, it can immerse you to a degree that you’ll come out of a longer session and need to take a second look at your real hands to know you’re out of the Matrix. The resolution per eye may be weaker than the Quest 3 512GB, but when it’s that close to your eyeballs you don’t need to suspend your disbelief like you might need to on a big TV these days. In truth, it took me diving into the same levels in both headsets to really understand the weak points of the 3S. The Quest 3’s colors and display seem more vivid and colorful overall. Maybe this was the pancake lenses showing their worth, or the fact that two LCD displays are better than one. Perhaps it was a combination of these things and the Quest 3’s boosted resolution. Regardless, things just seem more focused, and colors appear clearer on Quest 3. The Quest 3S still does a great job though, making it easy to spot the tiny bits of grime that still needed washing away in Power Wash Sim. I must say, both headsets come up a bit short in Blade & Sorcery Nomad when it comes to jaggy lines - something the Pico 4 Ultra has them both beat on. Doing more formalized tests really solidifies the value of extra RAM in that headset, especially because environments and details in surroundings pop in much more noticeably on the Quest 3S. Controller tracking is also a bit disappointing, which makes some weapons in the game unusable. The Pico 4 Ultra suffered similar issues, but I felt much more immersed in my sequences of fantasy mass murder on Pico’s headset than I do on the Quest 3S. The increased resolution of the Quest 3 really shows its worth in Asgard’s Wrath 2, with even its softer, more illustrative art style appearing clearer on the flagship model. To a layman, these environments will still be plenty expressive on the 3S, but you definitely notice a difference with some beefed-up resolution and an extra display panel. The same great audio quality from the Quest 3 carries over to the 3S though, so I can’t make any complaints about how immersive and high-quality games sound. I’m not one for mixed-reality spatial computing, but I did a bit more testing with this headset than I usually do. I can see it being a big draw for people who like the look of the Apple Vision Pro but are attracted to a much more affordable device. Hand tracking works fairly well for the most part, allowing me to pinch my fingers to interact, or get physically closer to a virtual menu and use them like I would a touch screen. The fact that Meta's Quest OS windows now operate within real spaces is pretty clever. Going upstairs in a friend’s house, then looking down at the ground, only to see the headset’s app library window still open through the floor was a bit wild, and something people are bound to get a kick out of. Watching content on YouTube and streaming services was where I found the Quest 3 to be a much more versatile option because focus is such a priority for big virtual cinema-like screens. With Pancake lenses, you definitely get a wider area of a virtual cinema screen in clarity without needing to move your head. Similarly, the Quest 3S’s narrower FOV makes itself known in these instances where you aren’t fully immersed since it can be harder to zone out the black borders around your content. Either way, PSVR 2 and the detail and vivid colors its OLED displays can throw at your eyeballs is much better. Not least because the inky black surroundings of any virtual screen in cinematic mode help you to feel more immersed. Keep in mind that I’m making these comparisons from the point of someone who has tried lots of VR headsets and that I’ve really been looking for holes to pick in the 3S. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. The Quest 3S has all of that, and the fact I can nitpick those features in a device at this price point is excellent. If you haven’t yet owned a modern, standalone VR headset, this is a fantastic option that gets you so many of the Quest 3’s software tricks and lots of its internals for a decent price. Enthusiasts who have played a lot of VR games before, on either a Quest 2 or PC VR headset, will probably want more than the 3S can provide, so I’d be inclined to recommend the full-fat Quest 3, or the Pico 4 Ultra. If you do have more budget to play with, maybe consider a PC option like the HTV Vive Focus Vision - not least because my concerns with how Meta collects our data still make me hesitant to recommend its hardware (see my Meta Quest Pro review). Still, this is maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created. Both in looks and spirit, it’s the spitting image of its father, the Meta Quest 2. However, with updated internals and software perks to its name, it’s potentially more worth a buy than its parent ever was. I tested the Meta Quest 3S for just over a month before writing this review. In that time I’ve used it for plenty of VR gaming, as well as watching some streaming content and general spatial computing tasks. I played a lot of Blade & Sorcery Nomad, Power Wash Sim VR, and Asgard’s Wrath 2 on the Quest 3S to test its gaming potential. To compare it with the Quest 3, I loaded up the same levels in each game and played them one after the other to take notes.

Title: GM investors plug into electrified growth story amid uncertain road

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At every turn of the road, GM chair and CEO Mary Barra has reinforced the mantra that 2024 was the "year of execution." Barra and her team made good on that promise to investors who were yearning for better returns, ultimately earning the auto icon the 2024 Yahoo Finance Surprise of the Year award. "There's been a lot of change. We're an industry in transformation and GM itself is in the midst of making sure we're ready and proactive for the changes that are coming," Barra told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive sitdown. Tightening the grips on EV losses and making better-received cars have paid off for GM. Read More: Why Walmart won Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year award The company lifted its profit guidance each time it reported earnings in 2024, powered by strong adoption of new crossover models, such as the Chevy Trax and the Cadillac Lyriq EV, and savvy cost cuts. GM used its improving cash position to repurchase $2.4 billion in stock year to date, more than double the pace compared to one year ago. It's sent a clear signal that despite expensive investments in EVs and a costlier UAW deal inked in 2023, Barra and her team think the stock is an attractive long-term buy. Shares of GM charged to a 47% advance this year, outperforming the 14% drop for rival Ford (F), which has struggled on product quality, and above the S&P 500's 26% gain. "I really felt validation for the team on how well received each of our EVs were," Barra, sporting her trademark black leather jacket, said when asked what has surprised her about the year. The auto leader is now entering her 12th year at the helm — a tenure almost unheard of in competitive and returns-minded corporate America. What's next for Barra and GM in 2025 could mirror 2024, with a few twists and turns. Following in her father's footsteps (he was a die maker at GM's now-defunct Pontiac badge), Barra, 62, began her journey inspecting fenders at a Pontiac plant at age 18. She went on to graduate from the General Motors Institute in 1985, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering. From there, her career path was as curvy as a country road — with stints in communications, marketing, and manufacturing. It's these connections to the company that have given Barra a lot of credibility among the rank and file and shareholders. Now, her intricate knowledge and quicker speed to make tough calls have come together. "GM has walked the walk and talked the talk this year," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. "This could be a triple-digit stock if they execute." Ives rates GM's stock at outperform. GM's third quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue reached $48.76 billion, beating estimates of $44.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.96, surpassing the $2.43 that was expected. The automaker also raised its full-year outlook for the third time. By comparison, in late October, Ford said it expected to hit the lower end of its full-year profit guidance. Ford guided to about $10 billion in earnings before interest and taxes this year, down from its prior range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Some strength for GM comes courtesy of its crossover vehicles and a more keen eye toward EV profits, Bank of America analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. He's bullish on GM's longer-term product portfolio, a mix of gas-powered trucks, cars, and EVs. “Importantly, when we get to calendar years ‘27 and ‘28, they have their pickups and large SUVs, which are an unbelievable franchise,” said Murphy, adding that no competitor has achieved this feat. “We may actually hit 18 million units in ‘27 and ‘28. I think there’s a tremendous amount of upside in the cycle." Barra had sought to be all-electric by 2035 but has since softened the stance amid industrywide weakness in EV sales. In July, GM delayed plans for a new Buick electric vehicle. Earlier this month, GM reached an agreement to sell its stake in a nearly completed EV battery plant in Lansing, Mich., to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. GM expects to recoup its $1 billion investment in the plant. "We still have a plan that allows us to get there, and so we're still executing to that plan," Barra said of the 2035 EV target. "But the most important thing is, and I've been saying this for a couple years now, is we're going to be guided by the consumer. We want to give the consumer choice. What do they want to drive?" Investors don't want good money thrown after bad, either. But it's the uncertain return on EVs that continues to hold the stock's valuation back, analysts tell Yahoo Finance. Despite the year of big-time cost-cutting, stock buybacks, and upside earnings surprises, GM's stock only trades on a 4.9 times forward price-to-earnings multiple, according to Yahoo Finance data. For perspective, the S&P 500 trades at 23 times forward earnings. Tesla clocks in at 126 times forward earnings. Even Ford trades at 5.9 times forward earnings. "Without a doubt as far as the earnings and EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] and free cash flow, we’re going to be at record levels for GM this year," said Murphy. "That’s the level that nobody thought would ever be consistently hit and it seems like they may be hitting that for the next few years.” To stay in the good graces of investors, GM has made a flurry of key decisions late in the year that could shore up profits further. Besides unloading the aforementioned Lansing EV plant, GM opted this month to restructure its China operations. The restructuring will lead to a $5 billion non-cash charge in the fourth quarter. For years, GM has owned 50% of its joint venture with SAIC General Motors Corp. "It was absolutely the right decision to make. And I think there is the chance over time that the rationalization of restructuring of China ultimately means an exit," Murphy said. Then, after a series of operational setbacks, GM pulled the plug on its Cruise robotaxi business. The company had invested $10 billion since acquiring Cruise in 2016. GM said it would merge its Cruise robotaxi business with its in-house, consumer-facing autonomous and driving assist technology group in charge of its Supercruise software. "I think we made some difficult decisions this year to set the business up for success because we're trying to really be proactive and look at where's the business going," Barra said of the China and Cruise decisions. More difficult decisions may be in the cards for 2025, if incoming President Donald Trump slaps 25% tariffs on key auto supplier countries Mexico and Canada. The auto industry is responsible for 26% of imports from Mexico to the US and 12% from Canada, UBS researchers estimate. GM produces highly profitable pickup trucks in Mexico. It has five large assembly plants in the countries. "Almost a third of GM's vehicles are coming from outside the US or from mostly from Mexico in North America," Murphy explained. "And there's a question of how fast you can react to that. You don't have a lot of extra capacity in the US to move." Barra is clear-eyed about the situation. "[Tariffs are] going to have an impact depending on what it is, how long it is, it will impact prices, which, you know, I think could have an impact on demand. But I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think right now is the time to communicate and make sure people understand the different impacts that will happen based on different decisions," Barra said. "And I have confidence that the new administration will look and do what's best for the American consumer and best for continuing to have great jobs that the auto industry provides."

Title: Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ has arrived. Now it needs to deliver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time.Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military.AI is a key element in Spatial Core:Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision.Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building".Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks.These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner.I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include:Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases.Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms.Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract.Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications.Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies.Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities.We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range.Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed.Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples:Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings.Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license componentIn recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses.Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content.Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education.Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by:Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech.Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era.Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation.Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core.Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments:Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems.Enhanced On-Device Spatial AI for Operational Efficiency and Security: Spatial computing devices can now perform advanced AI-driven tasks directly on their own hardware, enabling real-time environmental understanding, object recognition, and anomaly detection without constant cloud connectivity. Use cases: secure border monitoring, emergency response planning, infrastructure maintenance and technical troubleshooting.Industry-Grade Mixed Reality Headsets and Toolchains for Scalable Enterprise Solutions: High-performance mixed reality headsets, offering comfortable wearability, robust tracking, and industrial-grade durability, became standard gear in many professional fields letting enterprises rapidly create, deploy, and maintain applications - ranging from advanced training simulations for defense personnel to augmented production workflows for automotive manufacturing lines.We believe that these industry developments, coupled with ongoing technological advancements, position the Immersive industry for potential rapid adoption and substantial market expansion in upcoming years. 2025 Expectations:Looking forward, we expect overall revenues to be significantly higher in the coming quarters compared to the past year, resulting in above $3 million/Q revenue on average in the coming quarters. We expect that revenues for 2025 will be well above our revenues for 2024 (for reference, we previously disclosed that we expect our aggregate revenue for FY '25 - ending June 30, 2025 - to be in the $11-12 million range). This expected growth will be primarily driven by an increase in Spatial Core revenues, as well as potential growth in our other businesses.Our Gross Margin should continue to be in the 60-70% range.Post operational restructuring, our current operating cash expense base (pre revenue) is now less than $1 million per month.We expect to be cash flow positive and increase our cash balance throughout the upcoming calendar year, without the need for a capital raise.VRAR StockThe transformational and positive developments achieved in 2024 are not currently reflected in our stock price, creating what we believe is a very significant disconnect between our intrinsic value and our public company valuation.We have a strong position in the Immersive technology segment, AI and Cloud driven revenues, large enterprise and DoD customers, relationships with some of the most successful tech companies in the world, strong pipeline of growing revenues, high gross margins, positive expected cash flow, a clean balance sheet, 10 issued Immersive patents, etc. - yet we have an extremely low market cap and consistent selling pressure on the stock. In essence, we are an abandoned "Nano-Cap" but with top tier customers, partners, IP and technology in an exciting growth industry.The management, board and co-founders of the Company own approximately 33% of the outstanding shares. This group has never sold a share in the Company's history, even after the Glimpse's IPO in 2021, and is determined to maximize shareholder value. It is also a key reason why Glimpse continues to maintain a clean capital structure with no debt, no convertible debt and no preferred equity - a rarity in public companies of our size.This valuation disconnect has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on our ability to execute on our growth strategy. As such, the Board of Directors of the Company is exploring various aggressive strategic options to enable the business to be in a position to invest in its growth while unlocking the value inherent in our business and/or assets and may pursue such options in the future.Summary Remarks We have made major strides over the past year in repositioning and restructuring Glimpse strategically and operationally. It's an exciting time for the Immersive industry, Glimpse is positioned as a leading provider of enterprise Immersive software and services, and we are poised for revenue growth and cash profitability. However, this is not reflected in our stock price, to the great detriment of our growth potential and shareholders. Going forward, we are going to continue our focus on profitable growth and in parallel aggressively explore all strategic options with the goal of unlocking the value of our business and/or underlying assets. I thank you all for your interest in and support of Glimpse, and wish you all a nice holiday season and a happy and healthy 2025. Lyron L.

Company Contact: Maydan RothblumCFO & COOThe Glimpse Group, Inc.(917) 292-2685 SOURCE: The Glimpse Group, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com 2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time. Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military. AI is a key element in Spatial Core: Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision. Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building". Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks. These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner. I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include: Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases. Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms. Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract. Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications. Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies. Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities. We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range. Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed. Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples: Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings. Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license component In recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses. Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content. Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education. Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by: Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech. Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era. Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation. Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core. Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments: Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems. Enhanced On-Device Spatial AI for Operational Efficiency and Security: Spatial computing devices can now perform advanced AI-driven tasks directly on their own hardware, enabling real-time environmental understanding, object recognition, and anomaly detection without constant cloud connectivity. Use cases: secure border monitoring, emergency response planning, infrastructure maintenance and technical troubleshooting. Industry-Grade Mixed Reality Headsets and Toolchains for Scalable Enterprise Solutions: High-performance mixed reality headsets, offering comfortable wearability, robust tracking, and industrial-grade durability, became standard gear in many professional fields letting enterprises rapidly create, deploy, and maintain applications - ranging from advanced training simulations for defense personnel to augmented production workflows for automotive manufacturing lines. We believe that these industry developments, coupled with ongoing technological advancements, position the Immersive industry for potential rapid adoption and substantial market expansion in upcoming years. 2025 Expectations: Looking forward, we expect overall revenues to be significantly higher in the coming quarters compared to the past year, resulting in above $3 million/Q revenue on average in the coming quarters. We expect that revenues for 2025 will be well above our revenues for 2024 (for reference, we previously disclosed that we expect our aggregate revenue for FY '25 - ending June 30, 2025 - to be in the $11-12 million range). This expected growth will be primarily driven by an increase in Spatial Core revenues, as well as potential growth in our other businesses. Our Gross Margin should continue to be in the 60-70% range. Post operational restructuring, our current operating cash expense base (pre revenue) is now less than $1 million per month. We expect to be cash flow positive and increase our cash balance throughout the upcoming calendar year, without the need for a capital raise. VRAR Stock The transformational and positive developments achieved in 2024 are not currently reflected in our stock price, creating what we believe is a very significant disconnect between our intrinsic value and our public company valuation. We have a strong position in the Immersive technology segment, AI and Cloud driven revenues, large enterprise and DoD customers, relationships with some of the most successful tech companies in the world, strong pipeline of growing revenues, high gross margins, positive expected cash flow, a clean balance sheet, 10 issued Immersive patents, etc. - yet we have an extremely low market cap and consistent selling pressure on the stock. In essence, we are an abandoned "Nano-Cap" but with top tier customers, partners, IP and technology in an exciting growth industry. The management, board and co-founders of the Company own approximately 33% of the outstanding shares. This group has never sold a share in the Company's history, even after the Glimpse's IPO in 2021, and is determined to maximize shareholder value. It is also a key reason why Glimpse continues to maintain a clean capital structure with no debt, no convertible debt and no preferred equity - a rarity in public companies of our size. This valuation disconnect has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on our ability to execute on our growth strategy. As such, the Board of Directors of the Company is exploring various aggressive strategic options to enable the business to be in a position to invest in its growth while unlocking the value inherent in our business and/or assets and may pursue such options in the future. Summary Remarks We have made major strides over the past year in repositioning and restructuring Glimpse strategically and operationally. It's an exciting time for the Immersive industry, Glimpse is positioned as a leading provider of enterprise Immersive software and services, and we are poised for revenue growth and cash profitability. However, this is not reflected in our stock price, to the great detriment of our growth potential and shareholders. Going forward, we are going to continue our focus on profitable growth and in parallel aggressively explore all strategic options with the goal of unlocking the value of our business and/or underlying assets. I thank you all for your interest in and support of Glimpse, and wish you all a nice holiday season and a happy and healthy 2025. Lyron L.

Title: Never Forgive Them
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last year, I’ve spent about 200,000 words on a kind of personal journey where I’ve tried again and again to work out why everything digital feels so broken, and why it seems to keep getting worse, despite what tech’s “brightest” minds might promise. More regularly than not, I’ve found that the answer is fairly simple: the tech industry’s incentives no longer align with the user. The people running the majority of internet services have used a combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I’m stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from customers, but also by the insidious way they’ve gradually degraded their products. To be clear, I don’t believe that this gradual enshittification is part of some grand, Machiavellian long game by the tech companies, but rather the product of multiple consecutive decisions made in response to short-term financial needs. Even if it was, the result would be the same — people wouldn’t notice how bad things have gotten until it’s too late, or they might just assume that tech has always sucked, or they’re just personally incapable of using the tools that are increasingly fundamental to living in a modern world. You are the victim of a con — one so pernicious that you’ve likely tuned it out despite the fact it’s part of almost every part of your life. It hurts everybody you know in different ways, and it hurts people more based on their socioeconomic status. It pokes and prods and twists millions of little parts of your life, and it’s everywhere, so you have to ignore it, because complaining about it feels futile, like complaining about the weather. It isn’t. You’re battered by the Rot Economy, and a tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value. A death cult has taken over the markets, using software as a mechanism to extract value at scale in the pursuit of growth at the cost of user happiness. These people want everything from you — to control every moment you spend working with them so that you may provide them with more ways to make money, even if doing so doesn’t involve you getting anything else in return. Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and a majority of tech platforms are at war with the user, and, in the absence of any kind of consistent standards or effective regulations, the entire tech ecosystem has followed suit. A kind of Coalition of the Willing of the worst players in hyper-growth tech capitalism. Things are being made linearly worse in the pursuit of growth in every aspect of our digital lives, and it’s because everything must grow, at all costs, at all times, unrelentingly, even if it makes the technology we use every day consistently harmful. This year has, on some level, radicalized me, and today I’m going to explain why. It’s going to be a long one, because I need you to fully grasp the seriousness and widespread nature of the problem. You have, more than likely, said to yourself sometime in the last ten years that you “didn’t get tech,” or that you are “getting too old,” or that tech has “gotten away from you” because you found a service, or an app, or a device annoying. You, or someone you love, have convinced yourself that your inability to use something is a sign that you’re deficient, that you’ve failed to “keep up with the times,” as if the things we use every day should be in a constant state of flux. The tools we use in our daily lives outside of our devices have mostly stayed the same. While buttons on our cars might have moved around — and I’m not even getting into Tesla’s designs right now — we generally have a brake, an accelerator, a wheel, and a turn signal. Boarding an airplane has worked mostly the same way since I started flying, other than moving from physical tickets to digital ones. We’re not expected to work out “the new way to use a toilet” every few months because somebody decided we were finishing too quickly. Yet our apps and the platforms we use every day operate by a totally different moral and intellectual compass. While the idea of an update is fairly noble (and not always negative) — that something you’ve bought can be maintained and improved over time is a good thing — many tech platforms see it as a means to further extract and exploit, to push users into doing things that either keep them on the app longer or take more-profitable actions. We as a society need to reckon with how this twists us up, makes us more paranoid, more judgmental, more aggressive, more reactionary, because when everything is subtly annoying, we all simmer and suffer in manifold ways. There is no digital world and physical world — they are, and have been, the same for quite some time, and reporting on tech as if this isn’t the case fails the user. It may seem a little dramatic, but take a second and really think about how many little digital irritations you deal with in a day. It’s time to wake up to the fact that our digital lives are rotten. I’m not talking about one single product or company, but most digital experiences. The interference is everywhere, and we’ve all learned to accept conditions that are, when written out plainly, are kind of insane. Back in 2023, Spotify redesigned its app to, and I quote The Verge, be “part TikTok, part Instagram, and part YouTube,” which in practice meant replacing a relatively clean and straightforward user interface with one made up of full-screen cards (like TikTok) and autoplaying video podcasts (like TikTok), which CEO Daniel Ek claimed would, to quote Sky News, make the platform “come alive” with different content on a platform built and sold as a place to listen to music. The tech media waved off the redesign without really considering the significance of the fact that at the drop of a hat, hundreds of millions of people’s experience of listening to music would change based on the whims of a multi-billionaire, with the express purpose being to force these people to engage with completely different content as a means of increasing engagement metrics and revenue. By all means try and pretend this is “just an app,” but people’s relationships with music and entertainment are deeply important to their moods and motivations, and adding layers of frustration in an app they interact with for hours a day is consistently grating. And no matter how you feel, this design was never for the customer. Nobody using Spotify was saying “ah man, I wish I could watch videos on this,” but that doesn’t matter because engagement and revenue must increase. It’s clear that Spotify, a company best-known for exploiting the artists on its platform, treats its customers (both paying and otherwise) with a similar level of contempt. It’s far from alone. Earlier in the year, smart speaker company Sonos released a redesign of its app that removed accessibility features and the ability to edit song queues or play music from your phone in an attempt to “modernize” the interface, with WIRED suggesting that the changes could potentially open the door to adding a subscription of some sort to help Sonos’ ailing growth. Meta’s continual redesigns of Facebook and Instagram — the latest of which happened in October to “focus on Gen Z” — are probably the most egregious example of the constant chaos of our digital lives. As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. Every experience demands our email address, and giving out our email address adds another email to inboxes already stuffed with two types of spam — the actual “get the biggest laser” spam that hits the junk folder automatically, and the marketing emails we receive from clothing brands we wanted a discount from or newspapers we pay for that still feel it’s necessary to bother us 3 to 5 times a day. I’ve basically given up trying to fight back — how about you? Every app we use is intentionally built to “growth hack” — a term that means “moving things around in such a way that a user does things that we want them to do” so they spend more money or time on the platform — which is why dating apps gate your best matches behind $1.99 microtransactions, or why Uber puts “suggestions” and massive banners throughout their apps to try and convince you to use one of its other apps (or accidentally hit them, which gives Uber a chance to get you to try them), or why Outlook puts advertisements in your email inbox that are near-indistinguishable from new emails (they’re at the top of your inbox too), or why Meta’s video carousels intentionally only play the first few seconds of a clip as a means of making you click. Our digital lives are actively abusive and hostile, riddled with subtle and overt cons. Our apps are ever-changing, adapting not to our needs or conditions, but to the demands of investors and internal stakeholders that have reduced who we are and what we do to an ever-growing selection of manipulatable metrics. It isn’t that you don’t “get” tech, it’s that the tech you use every day is no longer built for you, and as a result feels a very specific kind of insane. Every app has a different design, almost every design is optimized based on your activity on said app, with each app trying to make you do different things in uniquely annoying ways. Meta has hundreds of people on its growth team perpetuating a culture that manipulates and tortures users to make company metrics improve, like limiting the amount of information in a notification to make a user browse deeper into the site, and deliberately promoting low-quality clickbait that promises “one amazing trick” because people click those links, even if they suck. It’s everywhere. After a coup by head of ads Prabhakar Raghavan in 2019, Google intentionally made search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times that people would search for something on the site. Ever wonder why your workplace uses Sharepoint and other horrible Microsoft apps? That’s because Microsoft’s massive software monopoly meant that it was cheaper for your boss to buy all of it in one place, and thus its incentive is to make it good enough to convince your boss to sign up for all of their stuff rather than an app that makes your life easier or better. Why does every website feel different, and why do some crash randomly or make your phone burn your hand? It’s because every publisher has pumped their sites full of as much ad tracking software as possible as a means of monetizing every single user in as many ways as possible, helping ads follow you across the entire internet. And why does everybody need your email? Because your inbox is one of the few places that advertisers haven’t found a consistent way to penetrate. It’s digital tinnitus. It’s the pop-up from a shopping app that you downloaded to make one purchase, or the deceptive notification from Instagram that you have “new views” that doesn’t actually lead anywhere. It is the autoplaying video advertisement on your film review website. It is the repeated request for you to log back into a newspaper website that you logged into yesterday because everyone must pay and nothing must get through. It is the hundredth Black Friday sale you got from a company that you swear you unsubscribed from eight times, and perhaps even did, but there’s no real way to keep track. It’s the third time this year you’ve had to make a new password because another data breach happened and the company didn’t bother to encrypt it. I’m not writing this to complain, but because I believe — as I hinted at a few weeks ago — that we are in the midst of the largest-scale ecological disaster of our time, because almost every single interaction with technology, which is required to live in modern society, has become actively adversarial to the user. These issues hit everything we do, all the time, a constant onslaught of interference, and I believe it’s so much bigger than just social media and algorithms — though they’re a big part of it, of course. In plain terms, everybody is being fucked with constantly in tiny little ways by most apps and services, and I believe that billions of people being fucked with at once in all of these ways has profound psychological and social consequences that we’re not meaningfully discussing. The average person’s experience with technology is one so aggressive and violative that I believe it leaves billions of people with a consistent low-grade trauma. We seem, as a society, capable of understanding that social media can hurt us, unsettle us, or make us feel crazed and angry, but I think it’s time to accept that the rest of the tech ecosystem undermines our wellbeing in an equally-insidious way. And most people don’t know it’s happening, because everybody has accepted deeply shitty conditions for the last ten years. Now, some of you may scoff at this a little — after all, you’re smart, you know about disinformation, you know about the tricks of these companies, and thus most people do, right? Wrong! Most people don’t think about the things they’re doing at all and are just trying to get by in a society that increasingly demands we make more money to buy the same things, with our lives both interfered with and judged by social networks with aggressive algorithms that feed us more things based on what we’ll engage with, which might mean said things piss us off or actively radicalize us. They’re nagged by constant notifications — an average of 46 a day — some useful, some advertisements, like Apple telling us there’s a nailbiter college football game regardless of whether we’ve ever interacted with anything football related, or a Slack message saying you haven’t joined a group you were invited to yet, or Etsy letting you know that you can buy things for an upcoming holiday. It’s relentless, and the more time you invest in using a device, the more of these notifications you get, making you less likely to turn them off. After all, how well are you doing keeping your inbox clean? Oh what’s that? You get 25 emails a day, many of them from a company owned by William Sonoma? Your work software veers between “shit” and “just okay,” and never really seems to get better, nor does any part seem to smoothly connect to another. Your organization juggles anywhere from five to fifteen different pieces of software — Slack or Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom for communication, Asana or Monday or Basecamp for project management, or Jira, or Trello, or any number of other different ways that your organization or team wants to plan things. When you connect with another organization, you find they’re using a different product, or perhaps they’re using the same one — say, Slack — and that one requires you to join their organization, which may or may not work. I’m not even talking about the innumerable amount of tech infrastructure products that more-technical workers have to deal with, or how much worse this gets if you’ve got a slower device. Every organization does things differently, and some don’t put a lot of thought into how they do so. Yet beyond the endless digital nags there’s the need to be constantly aware of scams and outright misinformation, both on social networks that don’t really care to stop it and on the chum box advertisements below major news publications — you know, the little weird stories at the bottom promising miracle cures. It’s easy to assume that it’s natural that you’d know there are entities out there trying to scam you or trick you, and I’d argue most people don’t. To most, a video from Rumble.com may as well be the same thing as a video from CNN.com, and most people would believe that every advertisement on every website is somehow verified for its accuracy, versus “sold at scale all the time to whoever will pay the money.” And when I say that, I’m really talking about CNN.com, a website that had 594 million visitors in October 2024. At the bottom is the “Paid Partner Content” section, including things from publications ‘like “FinanceBuzz” that tell you about the “9 Dumbest Things Smart People Waste Money On.” FinanceBuzz immediately asks for you to turn your notifications on — you know, so it can ping you when it has new articles — and each bullet point leads to one of its affiliate marketing arms trying to sell you car insurance and credit cards. You’re offered the chance to share your email address to receive “vetted side hustles and proven ways to earn extra cash sent to your inbox,” which I assume includes things like advertorial content telling you that yes, you could make money playing online bingo (such as “Bingo Cash”) against other people. Papaya Games, developer of Bingo Cash, was sued in March by rival gaming company Skillz for using bots in allegedly skill-based games that are supposed to be between humans, and the Michigan Gaming Control Board issued a cease-and-desist order against the company for violating multiple gaming laws, including the Lawful Internet Gaming Act. To quote the lawsuit, “Papaya’s games are not skill-based and users are often not playing against live, actual opponents but against Papaya’s own bots that direct and rig the game so that Papaya itself wins its users’ money while leading them to believe that they lost to a live human opponent.” This is a website and its associated content that has prime placement on the front page of a major news outlet. As a normal person, it’s reasonable to believe that CNN would not willfully allow advertisements for websites that are, in and of themselves, further advertisements masquerading as trustworthy third party entities. It’s reasonable that you would believe that FinanceBuzz was a reputable website, and that its intentions were to share great deals and secret tricks with you. If you think you’re not this stupid, you are privileged and need to have more solidarity with your fellow human beings. Why wouldn’t you think that the content on one of the most notable media outlets in the entire world is trustworthy? Why wouldn’t you trust that CNN, a respected media outlet, had vetted its advertisers and made sure their content wasn’t actively tricking its users? I think it’s fair to say that CNN has likely led to thousands of people being duped by questionable affiliate marketing companies, and likely profited from doing so. Why wouldn’t people feel insane? Why wouldn’t the internet, where we’re mostly forced to live, drive most people crazy? How are we not discussing the fact that so much of the internet is riddled with poison? How are we not treating the current state of the tech industry like an industrial chemical accident? Is it because there are too many people at fault? Is it because fixing it would require us to truly interrogate the fabric of a capitalist death cult? Nothing I am writing is polemic or pessimistic or describing anything other than the shit that’s happening in front of my eyes and your eyes and the eyes of billions of people. Dismissing these things as “just how it is” allows powerful people with no real plan and no real goals other than growth to thrive, and sneering at people “dumb enough” to get tricked by an internet and tech industry built specifically to trick them suggests you have no idea how you are being scammed, because you’re smug and arrogant. I need you to stop trying to explain away how fucking offensive using the internet and technology has become. I need you to stop making excuses for the powerful and consider the sheer scale of the societal ratfucking happening on almost every single device in the world, and consider the ramifications of the difficulty that a human being using the internet has trying to live an honest, dignified and reasonable life. To exist in modern society requires you to use these devices, or otherwise sacrifice large parts of how you’d interact with other people. You need a laptop or a smartphone for work, for school, for anything really. You need messaging apps otherwise you don’t exist. As a result, there is a societal monopoly of sorts — or perhaps it’s more of a cartel, in the sense that, for the most part, every tech company has accepted these extremely aggressive, anti-user positions, all in pursuit of growth. The stakes are so much higher than anyone — especially the tech media — is willing to discuss. The extent of the damage, the pain, the frustration, the terror is so constant that we are all on some level numb to its effects, because discussing it requires accepting that the vast majority of people live poisoned digital lives. We all live in the ruins created by the Rot Economy, where the only thing that matters is growth. Growth of revenue, growth of the business, growth of metrics related to the business, growth of engagement, of clicks, of time on app, of purchases of micro-transactions, of impressions of ads, of things done that make executives feel happy. I’ll give you a more direct example. On November 21, I purchased the bestselling laptop from Amazon — a $238 Acer Aspire 1 with a four-year-old Celeron N4500 Processor, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 128GB of slow eMMC storage (which is, and I’m simplifying here, though not by much, basically an SD card soldered to the computer’s motherboard). Affordable and under-powered, I’d consider this a fairly representative sample of how millions of people interact with the internet. I believe it’s also a powerful illustration of the damage caused by the Rot Economy, and the abusive, exploitative way in which the tech industry treats people at scale. It took 1 minute and 50 seconds from hitting the power button for the laptop to get to the setup screen. It took another minute and a half to connect and begin downloading updates, which took several more minutes. After that, I was faced with a licensing agreement where I agreed to binding arbitration to use Windows, a 24 second pause, and then got shown a screen of different “ways I could unlock my Microsoft experience,” with animations that shuddered and jerked violently. Throughout, the laptop’s cheap trackpad would miss every few clicks. At this point, I was forced to create a Microsoft account and to hand over my cellphone number — or another email address — to receive a code, or I wouldn’t be able to use the laptop. Each menu screen takes 3-5 seconds to load, and I’m asked to “customize my experience” with things like “personalized ads, tips and recommendations,” with every option turned on by default, then to sign up for another account, this time with Acer. At one point I am simply shown an ad for Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage product with a QR code to download it on my phone, and then I’m told that Windows has to download a few updates, which I assume are different to the last time it did that. It has taken, at this point, around 20 minutes to get to this screen. It takes another 33 minutes for the updates to finish, and then another minute and 57 seconds to log in, at which point it pops up with a screen telling me to “set up my browser and discover the best of Windows,” including “finding the apps I love from the Microsoft Store” and the option to “create an AI-generated theme for your browser.” The laptop constantly struggles as I scroll through pages, the screen juddering, apps taking several seconds to load. When I opened the start bar — ostensibly a place where you have apps you’d use — I saw some things that felt familiar, like Outlook, an email client that is not actually installed and requires you to download it, and an option for travel website Booking.com, along with a link to LinkedIn. One app, ClipChamp, was installed but immediately needed to be updated, which did not work when I hit “update,” forcing me to go to find the updates page, which showed me at least 40 different apps called things like “SweetLabs Inc.” I have no idea what any of this stuff is. I type “sweetlabs” into the search bar, and it jankily interrupts into a menu that takes up a third of the screen, with half of that dedicated to “Mark Twain’s birthday,” two Mark Twain-related links, a “quiz of the day,” and four different games available for download. The computer pauses slightly every time I type a letter. Every animation shudders. Even moving windows around feels painful. It is clunky, slow, it feels cheap, and the operating system — previously something I’d considered to be “the thing that operates the computer system” — is actively rotten, strewn with ads, sponsored content, suggested apps, and intrusive design choices that make the system slower and actively upset the user. The reason I’m explaining this in such agonizing detail is that this experience is more indicative of the average person’s experience using a computer than anybody realizes. Though it’s tough to gauge how many of these things sold to make it a bestseller on Amazon, laptops in this pricepoint, with this specific version of Windows (Windows 11 Home in “S Mode” as discussed above), happen to dominate Amazon’s bestsellers along with Apple’s significantly-more-expensive MacBook Air and Pro series. It is reasonable to believe that a large amount of the laptops sold in America match this price point and spec — there are two similar ones on Best Buy’s bestsellers, and as of writing this sentence, multiple different laptops of this spec are on the front of Target’s laptop page. And if I haven’t made it completely clear, this means that millions of people are likely using a laptop that’s burdensomely slow, and full of targeted advertisements and content baked into the operating system in a way that’s either impossible or difficult to remove. For millions of people — and it really could be tens of millions considering the ubiquity of these laptops in eCommerce stores alone — the experience of using the computer is both actively exploitative and incredibly slow. Even loading up MSN.com — the very first page you see when you open a web browser — immediately hits you with ads for eBay, QVC and QuickBooks, with icons that sometimes simply don’t load. Every part of the operating system seems to be hounding you to use some sort of Microsoft product or some sort of product that Microsoft or the laptop manufacturer has been paid to make you see. While one can hope that the people buying these laptops have any awareness of anything, the reality is that they’re being dumped into a kind of TJ Maxx version of computing, except TJ Maxx clothes don’t sometimes scream at you to download TJ Maxx Plus or stop functioning because you used them too fast. Again, this is how most people are experiencing modern computing, and it isn’t because this is big business — it’s because laptop sales have been falling for over a decade, and manufacturers (and Microsoft) need as many ways to grow revenue as possible, even if the choices they make are actively harmful to consumers. At that point, said person using this laptop can now log onto the internet, and begin using websites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, all of which have algorithms we don’t really understand, but that have been regularly proven to be actively — and deliberately — manipulative and harmful. Now, I know reading about “algorithms” and “manipulation” makes some people’s eyes glaze over, but I want you to take a simpler approach for a second. I hypothesize that most people do not really think about how they interact with stuff — they load up YouTube, they type something in, they watch it, and maybe they click whatever is recommended next. They may know there’s an algorithm of sorts, but they’re not really sitting there thinking “okay so they want me to see this,” or they may even be grateful that the algorithm gave them something they like, and reinforce the algorithm with their own biases, some of which they might have gotten from the algorithm. To be clear, none of this is mind control or hypnosis or voodoo. These algorithms and their associated entities are not sitting there with some vast agenda to execute — the algorithms are built to keep you on the website, even if it upsets you, pisses you off, or misinforms you. Their incentive isn’t really to make you make any one choice, other than one that involves you staying on their platform or interacting with an advertisement for somebody else’s, and the heavy flow of political — and particularly conservative — content is a result of platforms knowing that’s what keeps people doing stuff on the platform. The algorithms are constantly adapting in real time to try and find something that you might spend time on, with little regard for whether that content is good, let alone good for you. Putting aside any moral responsibility, the experiences on these apps are discordant. Facebook, as I’ve written about in detail, is a complete nightmare — thousands of people being actively conned in supposed “help groups,” millions of people being scammed every day (with one man killing himself as a result of organized crime’s presence on Facebook), and bizarre AI slop is dominating feeds with Mark Zuckerberg promising that there’s more to come. That’s without mentioning a product experience that continually interrupts you with sponsored and suggested content, as these platforms always do, all algorithmically curated to keep you scrolling, while also hiding content from the people you care about, because Facebook thinks it won’t keep you on the platform for as long. The picture I am trying to paint is one of terror and abuse. The average person’s experience of using a computer starts with aggressive interference delivered in a shoddy, sludge-like frame, and as the wider internet opens up to said user, already battered by a horrible user experience, they’re immediately thrown into heavily-algorithmic feeds each built to con them, feeding whatever holds their attention and chucking ads in as best they can. As they browse the web, websites like NBCnews.com feature stories from companies like “WorldTrending.com” with advertisements for bizarre toys written in the style of a blog, so intentional in their deceit that the page in question has a huge disclaimer at the bottom saying it’s an ad. As their clunky, shuddering laptop hitches between every scroll, they go to ESPN.com, and the laptop slows to a crawl. Everything slows to a crawl. “God damnit, why is everything so fucking slow? I’ll just stay on Facebook or Instagram or YouTube. At least that place doesn’t crash half the time or trick me.” Using the computer in the modern age is so inherently hostile that it pushes us towards corporate authoritarians like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Meta — and now that every single website is so desperate for our email and to show us as many ads as possible, it’s either harmful or difficult for the average person to exist online. The biggest trick that these platforms played wasn’t any one algorithm, but the convenience of a “clean” digital experience — or, at least as clean as they feel it needs to be. In an internet so horribly poisoned by growth capitalism, these platforms show a degree of peace and consistency, even if they’re engineered to manipulate you, even if the experience gets worse seemingly every year, because at least it isn’t as bad as the rest of the internet. We use Gmail because, well, at least it’s not Outlook. We use YouTube to view videos from other websites because other websites are far more prone to crash, have quality issues, or simply don’t work on mobile. We use Google Search, despite the fact that it barely works anymore, to find things because actually browsing the web fucking sucks. When every single website needs to make as much money as possible because their private equity or hedge fund or massive corporate owners need to make more money every year without fail, the incentives of building the internet veer away from providing a service and toward putting you, the reader, in silent service of a corporation. ESPN’s app is a fucking mess — autoplaying videos, discordantly-placed scores, menus that appear to have been designed by M.C. Escher — and nothing changes because Disney needs you to use the app and find what you need, versus provide information in anything approaching a sensible way. It needs your effort. The paid subscription model for dating apps is so aggressive that there’s a lawsuit filed against Match Group — which owns Tinder and Hinge, and thus a great deal of the market — for “gamifying the platforms to transform users into gamblers locked in a search for psychological rewards,” likely as a means of recouping revenue after user numbers have begun to fall. And if you’re curious why these companies aren’t just making their products less horrible to use, I’m afraid that would reduce revenue, which is what they do care about. If you’re wondering who else is okay with that, it’s Apple. Both Bumble and Tinder are regularly featured on the “Must-Have Apps” section of the App Store, most of which require a monthly fee to work. Each of these apps is run by a company with a “growth” team, and that team exists, on some level, to manipulate you — to move icons around so that you’ll interact with the things they want you to, see ads, or buy things. This is why HBO Max rebranded to Max and created an entirely new app experience — because the growth people said “if we do this in this way the people using it will do what we want.” Now, what’s important to accept here is that absolutely none of this is done with any real consideration of the wider effects on the customer, as long as the customer continues doing the things that the company needs them to. We, as people, have been trained to accept a kind of digital transience — an inherent knowledge that things will change at random, that the changes may suck, and that we will just have to accept them because that’s how the computer works, and these companies work hard to suppress competition as a means of making sure they can do what they want. In other words, internet users are perpetually thrown into a tornado of different corporate incentives, and the less economically stable or technologically savvy you are, the more likely you are to be at the mercy of them. Every experience is different, wants something, wants you to do something, and the less people know about why the more likely they are to — with good intentions — follow the paths laid out in front of them with little regard for what might be happening, in the same way people happily watch the same TV shows or listen to the same radio stations. Even if you’re technologically savvy, you’re still dealing with these problems — fresh installs of Windows on new laptops, avoiding certain websites because you’ve learned what the dodgy ones look like, not interacting with random people in your DMs because you know what a spam bot looks like, and so on. It’s not that you’re immune. It’s that you’re instinctually ducking and weaving around an internet and digital ecosystem that continually tries to interrupt you, batting away pop-ups and silencing notifications knowing that they want something from you — and I need you to realize that most people are not like you and are actively victimized by the tech ecosystem. As I said a few weeks ago, I believe that most people are continually harmed by their daily lives, as most people’s daily lives are on the computer or their smartphones, and those lives have been stripped of dignity. When they look to the media for clarity or validation, the best they’ll get is a degree of “hmm, maybe algorithm bad?” rather than a wholehearted acceptance that the state of our digital lives is obscene. Yet it’s not just the algorithms — It’s the entirety of the digital ecosystem, from websites to apps to the devices we use every day. The fact that so many people likely use a laptop that is equal parts unfit for the task and stuffed full of growth hacked poison is utterly disgraceful, because it means that the only way to escape said poison is to simply have more money. Those who can’t afford $300 (at least) phones or $600 laptops are left to use offensively bad technology, and we have, at a societal scale, simply accepted that this is how things go. Yet even on expensive devices you’re still the victim of algorithmic and growth-hacked manipulation, even if we’re aware of it. Knowing allows you to fight back, even if it’s just to stop yourself being overwhelmed by the mess, and means you can read things that can tell you what new horror we need to avoid next — but you are still the target, you are still receiving hundreds of marketing emails a week, you are still receiving spam calls, you are still unable to use Facebook or Instagram without being bombarded by ads and algorithmically-charged content. I’ve written a lot about how the growth-at-all-costs mindset of The Rot Economy is what directly leads big tech companies to make their products worse, but what I’ve never really quantified is the scale of its damage. Everything I’ve discussed around the chaos and pain of the web is a result of corporations and private equity firms buying media properties and immediately trying to make them grow, each in wildly different ways, all clamouring to be the next New York Times or Variety or other legacy media brand, despite those brands already existing, and the ideas for competing with them usually being built on unsustainably-large staffs and expensive consultants. Almost every single store you visit on the internet has a massive data layer on the background that feeds them data about what’s popular, or where they’re spending the most time on the site, and will in turn change things about their design to subtly encourage you to buy more stuff, all so that more money comes out, no matter the cost. Even if this data isn’t personalized, it’s still powerful, and turns so many experiences into subtle manipulations. Every single weird thing that you’ve experienced with an app or service online is the dread hand of the Rot Economy — the gravitational pull of growth, the demands upon you, the user, to do something. And when everybody is trying to chase growth, nobody is thinking stability, and because everybody is trying to grow, everybody sort of copies everybody else’s ideas, which is why we see microtransactions and invasive ads and annoying tricks that all kind of feel the same in everything, though they’re all subtly different and customized just for that one app. It’s exhausting. For a while, I’ve had the Rot Economy compared to Cory Doctorow’s (excellent) enshittification theory, and I think it’s a great time to compare (and separate) the two. To quote Cory in The Financial Times, Enshittification is “[his] theory explaining how the internet was colonised by platforms, why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, why it matters and what we can do about it.” He describes the three stages of decline: “First, platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.” I agree with Cory on some levels, but I believe he gives far more credit to the platforms in question than they deserve, and sees far more intention or strategy than really exists. I fundamentally disagree about the business customers even being some elevated class in the equation — as we’ve seen with the Google Ads trial, Google didn’t really give a shit about its business customers to begin with, has always sought a monopoly, and made things worse for whoever it needed to as a means of increasing growth. Perhaps that’s semantics. However, Cory’s theory lacks a real perpetrator beyond corporations that naturally say “alright we’re gonna do Enshittification now, watch this.” Where The Rot Economy separates is that growth is, in and of itself, the force that drives companies to enshittify. While enshittification neatly fits across companies like Spotify and Meta (and their ad-focused business models), it doesn’t really make sense when it comes to things where there isn’t a clear split between business customers and consumers, like Microsoft or Salesforce — because enshittification is ultimately one part of the larger Rot Economy, where everything must grow forever. And I believe the phenomenon that captures both is a direct result of the work of men like Jack Welch and Milton Friedman. The Rot Economy is selfish and potently neoliberal — corporations are bowed down to like gods, and the powerful only seek more, at all times, at all costs, even if said cost is “the company might eventually die because we’ve burned out any value it actually has” or “people are harmed every time they pick up their phone.” The Rot Economy is neoliberalism’s true innovation: a kind of economic cancer that with few reasons to exist beyond “more” and few justifications beyond “if we don’t let it keep growing then everybody’s pensions blow up.” To be clear, Cory is for the most part right. Enshittification successfully encapsulates how the modern web was destroyed in a way that nobody really has. I think it applies in a wide-ranging way to a wide range of tech companies and effects. I, however, believe the wider problem is bigger, and the costs are far greater. It isn’t that “everything is enshittified.” It’s that everybody’s pursuit of growth has changed the incentive behind how we generate value in the world, and software enables a specific kind of growth-lust by creating virtual nation states with their own digital despots. While laws may stop Meta from tearing up people’s houses surrounding its offices on 1 Hacker Way, it can happily reroute traffic and engagement on Facebook and Instagram to make things an iota more profitable. The Rot Economy isn’t simply growth-at-all-costs thinking — it’s a kind-of secular religion, something to believe in, that everything and anything can be more, should be more, must be more, that we are defined only by our pursuit of more growth, and that something that isn’t growing isn’t alive, and is in turn inferior. No, perhaps not a religion. Religions are, for the most part, concerned with the hereafter, and contain an ethical dimension that says your present actions will affect your future — or your eternity. The Rot Economy is, by every metric, defined by its short-termism. I’m not just talking about undermining the long-term success of a business to juice immediate revenue numbers. I’m thinking in broad ecosystem terms. The onslaught of AI-generated content — facilitated, in no small part, by Google and Microsoft — has polluted our information ecosystems. AI-generated images and machine-generated text is everywhere, and it’s impossible to avoid, as there is no reliable way to determine the provenance of a piece of content — with one exception, namely the considered scrutiny of a human. This has irreparably damaged the internet in ways I believe few fully understand. This stuff — websites that state falsehoods because an AI hallucinated, or fake pictures of mushrooms and dogs that now dominate Google Images — is not going away. Like microplastics or PFAS chemicals, they’re with us forever, constantly chipping away at our understanding of reality. These companies unleashed generative AI on the world — or, in the case of Microsoft, facilitated its ascendency — without any consideration of what that would mean for the Internet as an ecosystem. Their concerns were purely short-term. Fiscal. The result? Over-leverage in an industry that has no real path to profitability, burning billions of dollars and the environment - both digital and otherwise - along with it. I’m not saying that this is how everybody thinks, but I am convinced that everybody is burdened by The Rot Economy, and that digital ecosystems allow the poison of growth to find new and more destructive ways to dilute a human being to a series of numbers that can be made to grow or contract in the pursuit of capital. Almost every corner of our lives has been turned into some sort of number, and increasing that number is important to us — bank account balances, sure, but also engagement numbers, followers, number of emails sent and received, open rates on newsletters, how many times something we’ve seen has been viewed, all numbers set by other people that we live our lives by while barely understanding what they mean. Human beings thrive on ways to define themselves, but metrics often rob us of our individuality. Products that boil us down to metrics are likely to fail to account for the true depth of anything they're capturing. The change in incentives toward driving more growth actively pushes out those with long-term thinking. It encourages hiring people who see growth as the driver of a company's success, and in turn investment, research and development into mechanisms for growth, which may sometimes be things that help you, but that isn't necessarily the reason they're doing it. Organisational culture and hiring stops prioritising people that fix customer problems, because that is neither the priority nor, sadly, how one makes a business continue to grow. We are all pushed toward growth — personal growth, professional growth, growth in our network and our societal status — and the terms of this growth are often set by platforms and media outlets that are, in turn, pursuing growth. And as I've discussed, the way the terms of our growth is framed is almost entirely through a digital ecosystem of warring intents and different ways of pursuing growth — some ethical, many not. Societal and cultural pressure is nothing new, but the ways we experience it are now elaborate and chaotic. Our relationships — professional, personal, and romantic — are processed through the funhouse mirror of the platforms, changing in ways both subtle and overt based on the signals we receive from the people we care about, each one twisted and processed through the lens of product managers and growth hackers. Changes to these platforms — even subtle ones — actively change the lives of billions of people, and it feels like we talk about it like being online is some hobbyist pursuit rather than something that many people do more than seeing real people in the real world. I believe that we exist in a continual tension with the Rot Economy and the growth-at-all-costs mindset. I believe that the friction we feel on platforms and apps between what we want to do and what the app wants us to do is one of the most underdiscussed and significant cultural phenomena, where we, despite being customers, are continually berated and conned and swindled. I believe billions of people are in active combat with their devices every day, swiping away notifications, dodging around intrusive apps, agreeing to privacy policies that they don’t understand, desperately trying to find where an option they used to use has been moved to because a product manager has decided that it needed to be somewhere else. I realize it’s tough to conceptualize because it’s so ubiquitous, but how much do you fight with your computer or smartphone every day? How many times does something break? How many times have you downloaded an app and found it didn’t really do the thing you wanted it to? How many times have you wanted to do something simple and found that it’s actually really annoying? How much of your life is dodging digital debris, avoiding scams, ads, apps that demand permissions, and endless menu options that bury the simple things that you’re actually trying to do? You are the victim of a con. You have spent years of your life explaining to yourself and others that “this is just how things are,” accepting conditions that are inherently exploitative and abusive. You are more than likely not deficient, stupid, or “behind the times,” and even if you are, there shouldn’t be multi-billion dollar enterprises that monetize your ignorance. And it’s time to start holding those responsible accountable. I’m fairly regularly asked why this all matters to me so much, so as I wrap up the year, I’m going to try and answer that question, and explain why it is I do what I do. I spent a lot of time alone as a kid. I didn't have friends. I was insular, scared of the world, I felt ostracised and unnoticed, like I was out of place in humanity. The only place I found any kind of community — any kind of real identity — was being online. My life was (and is) defined by technology. Had social networking not come along, I am not confident I’d have made many (if any) lasting friendships. For the first 25 or so years of my life, I struggled to make friends in the real world for a number of reasons, but made so many more online. I kept and nurtured friendships with people thousands of miles away, my physical shyness less of an issue when I could avoid the troublesome “hey I’m Ed” part that tripped me up so much. Without the internet, I’d likely be a resentful hermit, disconnected from humanity, layers of scar tissue over whatever neurodivergence or unfortunate habits I'd gained from a childhood mostly spent alone. Don't feel sorry for me. Technology has allowed me to thrive. I have a business, an upcoming book, this newsletter, and my podcast. I have so many wonderful, beautiful friends who I love that have come exclusively through technology of some sort, likely a social network or the result of a digital connection of some kind. I am immensely grateful for everything I have, and grateful that technology allowed me to live a full and happy life. I imagine many of you feel the same way. Technology has found so many ways to make our lives better, perhaps more in some cases than others. I will never lie and say I don't love it. However, the process of writing this newsletter and recording my podcast has made me intimately aware of the gratuitous, avaricious and intentional harm that the tech industry has caused to its customers, the horrifying and selfish decisions they’ve made, and the ruinous consequences that followed. The things I have watched happen this year alone — which have been at times an enumeration of over a decade of rot — have turned my stomach, as has the outright cowardice of some people that claim to inform the public but choose instead to reinforce the structures of the powerful. I am a user. I am a guy with a podcast and a newsletter, but I am behind the mic and the keyboard a person that uses the same services as you do, and I see the shit done to us, and I feel poison in my veins. I am not holding back, and neither should you. What is being done to us isn't just unfair — it's larcenous, cruel, exploitative and morally wrong. Some may try to dismiss what I'm saying as "just social media" or "just how apps work" and if that's what you truly think, you're either a beaten dog or a willing (or unwilling) operative for the people running the con. I will never forgive these people for what they’ve done to the computer, and the more I learn about both their intentions and actions the more certain I am that they are unrepentant and that their greed will never be sated. I have watched them take the things that made me human — social networking, digital communities, apps, and the other connecting fabric of our digital lives — and turned them into devices of torture, profitable mechanisms of abuse, and find it disgusting how many reporters seem to believe it's their responsibility to thank them and explain why it's good this is happening to their readers. These are the people in charge. These are the people running the tech industry. These are the people who make decisions that affect billions of people every minute of every day, and their decisionmaking is so flagrantly selfish and abusive that I am regularly astonished by how little criticism they receive. These men lace our digital lives with asbestos and get told they’re geniuses for doing so because money comes out. I don’t know — or care — whether these men know who I am or read my work, because I only care that you do. I don't give a shit if Sam Altman or Mark Zuckerberg knows my name. I don't care about any of their riches or their supposed achievements, I care that when given so many resources and opportunities to change the world they chose to make it worse. These men are tantamount to war criminals, except in 30 years Mark Zuckerberg may still be seen as a success — though I will spend the rest of my life telling you the damage he's caused. I care about you. The user. The person reading this. The person that may have felt stupid, or deficient, or ignorant, all because the services you pay for or that monetize you have been intentionally rigged against you. You aren't the failure. The services, the devices, and the executives are. If you cannot see the significance of the problems I discuss every week, the sheer scale of the rot, the sheer damage caused by unregulated and unrepentant managerial parasites, you are living in a fantasy world and I both envy and worry for you. You're the frog in the pot, and trust me, the stove is on. 2025 will be a year of chaos, fear and a deficit of hope, but I will spend every breath I have telling you what I believe and telling you that I care, and you are not alone. For years, I’ve watched the destruction of the services and the mechanisms that were responsible for allowing me to have a normal life, to thrive, to be able to speak with a voice that was truly mine. I’ve watched them burn, or worse, turned into abominable growth vehicles for men disconnected from society and humanity. I owe my life to an internet I've watched turned into multiple abuse factories worth multiple trillions of dollars and the people responsible get gladhandled and applauded. I will scream at them until my dying fucking breath. I have had a blessed life, and I am lucky that I wasn't born even a year earlier or later, but the way I have grown up and seen things change has allowed me to fully comprehend how much damage is being done today, and how much worse is to come if we don't hold these people accountable. The least they deserve is a spoken or written record of their sins, and the least you deserve is to be reminded that you are the victim. I don't think you realise how powerful it is being armed with knowledge — the clarity of what's being done to and why, and the names of the people responsible. This is an invisible war — and a series of invisible war crimes — perpetuated against billions of people in a trillion different ways every minute of every day, and it's everywhere, a constant in our lives, which makes enumerating and conceptualising it difficult. But you can help. You talking about the truth behind generative AI, or the harms of Facebook, or the gratuitous destruction of Google Search will change things, because these people are unprepared for a public that knows both what they’ve done and their sickening, loathsome, selfish and greedy intentions. I realize this isn’t particularly satisfying to some, because you want big ideas, big changes that can be made. I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t know how to fix things. To quote Howard Beale in the movie Network, I don’t want you to write your Congressman because I don’t know what to tell you to write. But what I can tell you is that you can live your life with a greater understanding of the incentives of those who control the internet and have made your digital lives worse as a means of making themselves rich. I can tell you to live with more empathy, understanding and clarity into the reasons that people around you might be angry at their circumstances, as even those unrelated to technology are made worse by exploitative, abusive and pernicious digital manipulation. This is a moment of solidarity, as we are all harmed by the Rot Economy. We are all victims. It takes true opulence to escape it, and I'm guessing you don't have it. I certainly don't. But talking about it — refusing to go quietly, refusing to slurp down the slop willingly or pleasantly — is enough. The conversations are getting louder. The anger is getting too hard to ignore. These companies will be forced to change through public pressure and the knowledge of their deeds. Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative works because he's desperate for power. Every time you do this, you destabilise them. They have succeeded in a decades-long marketing campaign where they get called geniuses for making the things that are necessary to function in society worse. You can change that. I don't even care if you cite me. Just tell them. Tell everybody. Spread the word. Say what they've done and say their names, say their names again and again and again so that it becomes a contagion. They have twisted and broken and hyper-monetised everything — how you make friends, fall in love, how you bank, how you listen to music, how you find information. Never let their names be spoken without disgust. Be the sandpaper in their veins and the graffiti on their legacies. The forces I criticize see no beauty in human beings. They do not see us as remarkable things that generate ideas both stupid and incredible, they do not see talent or creativity as something that is innately human, but a commodity to be condensed and monetized and replicated so that they ultimately own whatever value we have, which is the kind of thing you’d only believe was possible (or want) if you were fully removed from the human race. You deserve better than they’ve given you. You deserve better than I’ve given you, which is why I’m going to work even harder in 2025. Thank you, as ever, for your time. Subscribe today. It's free.

The US central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday, bringing rates down by a total 100 bps in 2024. But the central bank’s outlook on rates will be closely watched, especially in light of recent data showing inflation grew stickier in November, while the labor market remained strong.

What’s also interesting is that the Friday low took support at the Bollinger-middle line, which means buyers remain active on any decline inside what will soon be a period of reduced volumes and therefore higher volatility.

Title: SoftBank’s $100 Billion Promise To Trump Is More Than Its Entire Market Cap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/12/16/softbank-trump-masayoshi-son-100-billion/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T00:35:35Z
Full Content:
The Japanese tech conglomerate has assets, like a majority stake in British chip company Arm, but hasn’t detailed how it will pony up. SoftBank announced a $100 billion commitment to U.S. projects over the span of Trump's presidency. On Monday, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump jointly announced a bold commitment: The Japanese tech conglomerate aims to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. It was a glitzy pledge from a global tech leader, teaming up with the incoming president with a promise to create at least 100,000 new American jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The announcement eclipses a similar one Son made in 2016 as Trump first took office — a $50 billion pledge and 50,000 jobs. “President Trump is a double down president,” Son said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida. “I’m going to have to double down.” There’s just one hitch: SoftBank doesn’t actually have $100 billion at the moment. As of market close on Monday, its entire market cap was $97 billion, and it has $29 billion in cash on hand. It’s unclear how the company would finance its pledge and Son didn’t bother to detail how during its announcement. The commitment is over the span of Trump’s presidency, so SoftBank will have years to make good on its promise. The company did fulfill its 2016 vow of $50 billion, with investments in dozens of companies including Slack and DoorDash. It’s more difficult to determine if it created that number of jobs, and the company did not provide an estimate at the end of Trump’s last term. SoftBank didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company’s most valuable asset is a majority stake in Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor company that went public last year. Arm’s market cap is currently $152.6 billion, with SoftBank’s roughly 90% stake valued at $137.3 billion. If liquidated, it would easily cover the company’s commitment. It’s unlikely, of course, that SoftBank would sell off its entire stake. Offloading large amounts of stock would probably cause the share price to crater. It could use its Arm stock as leverage to take out debt that would finance this commitment; but SoftBank has already taken out $8 billion in margin loans against its Arm stock. In reaching into the Arm piggy bank, SoftBank doesn’t want to repeat missteps it took with Alibaba. In 2000, SoftBank invested $20 million in the Chinese ecommerce company, which went public in 2014 in the largest tech IPO ever, raising $25 billion. SoftBank reportedly owned 24% of the company at the time — a stake that dwindled to 7% in 2022, and down to half a percent by last May. SoftBank’s announcement comes as several tech executives have tried to curry favor with Trump as he returns to power. In the last few days, Facebook parent Meta, Amazon and OpenAI have reportedly promised to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inauguration fund. With key supporters like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley has struck a different tone from when Trump first took office four years ago. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently made a visit to Mar-a-Lago, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly has a visit in the works. SoftBank is best known for its Vision Fund, a $100 billion venture fund it announced in 2017 for investing in tech companies worldwide, with half the funds raised from the sovereign wealth funds of Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the Vision Fund came to be known for misplaced bets, including the ill-fated coworking real estate company WeWork, and Softbank posted an $18 billion loss. In 2020, the activist investor Elliott Management bought a $2.5 billion stake in the Vision Fund and pushed for restructuring and more transparency. By the time Softbank set out to raise more money for a Vision Fund 2, the company had trouble courting investors because of the first fund’s issues. In trying to hit the $100 billion mark, the company could potentially count already-announced commitments to its tally. For example, Softbank reportedly invested another $1.5 billion in OpenAI last month through an employee tender offer. In May, the Japanese company said it would commit $9 billion a year to AI investments, though it didn’t specify where it would make its bets. Trump, who described Son as “one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time,” didn’t seem worried about where the money would come from, and even pushed for more. “I’ve looked at their books and they do have the possibility of doing more,” Trump said Monday. “I’m going to ask them to do a little bit more.” He then challenged Son to double his promise again to $200 billion. While remaining noncommittal, Son laughed and said he would “try to make it happen.” “He’s a great negotiator,” he said. Additional reporting by Iain Martin.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2 per cent of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550 per cent this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7 per cent on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042 per cent lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200 per cent since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics and Hoth Therapeutics have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir and Axon Enterprise, Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina, Super Micro and Moderna. The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Title: Inside Amazon Web Services’ Ambition to Train Two Million A.I. Workers: Q&A

Time Published: 2024-12-16T21:15:01Z

As Big Tech invests billions into the expansion of their cloud infrastructure for A.I., companies are struggling to find workers with the skills needed for cloud computing roles. Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) seeks to address this talent gap through its AWS Skills Centers, offering a stepping stone for entry-level roles like IT support technicians, systems administrators, developers and engineers with salaries starting at $73,000 a year. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. AWS Skills Centers provide free, in-person training for local community members exploring cloud careers. Introduced in 2021, AWS’s learning hubs offer hands-on classes, workshops, exhibitions, immersive virtual reality experiences and certification programs as part of Amazon’s goal to train over two million people with A.I. skills by 2025. Courses range from introductory classes on generative A.I. to training for cloud practitioner roles, which are gaining traction. As of October, more than 145,000 students have participated in these programs across its three locations in Cape Town in South Africa and Amazon’s U.S. home bases in Seattle, Wash. and Arlington, Va., according to AWS. The global cloud computing market generated $602 billion in revenue in 2023 and is projected to grow 21.2 percent annually through 2030 as companies seek additional compute capacity to run A.I. workloads, according to Grand View Research. IDC forecasts that global annual spending on cloud services will reach $805 billion by the end of 2024 and double by 2028. That’s good news for AWS, which owns half of the global cloud market. Observer spoke with Jenni Troutman, director of AWS Training and Certification Products and Services, about the AWS Skills Centers and how they prepare students for cloud careers in an A.I.-driven world. Before joining AWS in 2017, Troutman held various leadership roles at New Relic, VMware and Accenture. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Observer: What was the impetus behind the AWS Skills Lab? How has the program evolved since its inception? Jenni Troutman: The original idea for the Skills Centers was to establish locations in high-traffic areas where there’s a significant need for cloud skills. That way, people curious about the cloud but unfamiliar with it could drop by, have a coffee, explore opportunities and decide if they’re interested in learning more. From there, they could begin a journey that might extend into other programs at the Skills Center or elsewhere. The first Skills Center opened at our headquarters in Seattle. It was a natural starting point because our executives and training team were already there, allowing us to test the concept. The response was strong—not just from learners but also from nonprofits and government organizations interested in helping their communities develop cloud skills. Now, we’ve expanded to locations in Arlington and Cape Town, South Africa. How does the AWS Skills Lab differ from college degrees in computer science or typical workforce development programs like coding boot camps? Does it offer any unique value to job seekers exploring alternative pathways into cloud computing? The Skills Centers offer hands-on classroom experiences led by AWS experts, where students can see how the skills they learn apply to industries like robotics and gaming. Additionally, we host sessions featuring employers and other organizations that share insights about careers in the cloud. Representatives from outside AWS discuss the skills they look for in employees for various roles. And importantly, all of this is free. What do you think is the advantage of AWS Skills instructors over computer science professors at universities? One key advantage is their real-world experience in understanding how AWS customers use our services. Another is their deep expertise in AWS tools and services. Students also have the chance to work directly with our service teams, getting a first-hand look at the types of projects they might work on at AWS. What misconceptions do students have about the AWS Skills programs? When I first heard about them, I assumed they were career development programs designed to land people jobs at AWS, but I’m sure they’re more nuanced than that. You’re right—it’s not solely about getting people job-ready. The Skills Centers are more focused on introducing students to the types of cloud jobs available and getting them started on their learning journey. For those who discover they have an aptitude for and interest in the cloud, we guide them toward next-level programs, like AWS Restart and AWS Cloud Institute, that prepare them for employment. The tech job market is tough right now, with many struggling post-layoffs and fierce competition. Does AWS tailor its skills programs to align with in-demand jobs? Despite challenges in the overall job market, there’s still a significant shortage of cloud professionals. The fastest-growing demand is for A.I.-adjacent roles like data scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers. Over the last two years, we’ve seen accelerated demand for skills in A.I., machine learning, big data and security, which have become some of our most popular courses. There’s also a notable wage premium for A.I. skills—up to 45 percent higher pay for roles in finance, HR, marketing, and sales that require proficiency with A.I.-powered tools. Job seekers often worry that A.I. automation will replace jobs. How does the AWS Skills Lab prepare students to remain employable in the face of these trends? A.I. will undoubtedly change jobs, but it will also create new ones. Existing roles will become more productive with A.I., as it allows for automation of routine tasks, giving people more time to focus on creativity and innovation. The Skills Centers help students understand these changes, demystify A.I., and show what’s possible. This is just the next major technological shift, similar to the rise of the internet. What specific skills taught at AWS are less likely to be replaced by A.I.? Creativity and innovation are irreplaceable. A.I. is a tool, but humans must define the application, solve problems, and generate ideas. Additionally, effectively using A.I. tools requires foundational skills. For instance, with coding companions like the Amazon Q Developer (formerly known as CodeWhisperer), you need to know how to craft prompts to get the desired results. Learning prompt engineering can significantly boost productivity. What’s next for the AWS Skills Lab? We’ll continue to refresh and adapt our training to ensure it remains relevant. This includes introducing new in-person experiences and programs. The cloud and tech landscape evolves daily, so it’s crucial for people to keep building and updating their skills to stay competitive.

Title: Nvidia Stock Limps To Correction Territory As AI Leader’s Post-Election Slump Deepens

Longtime Wall Street favorite Nvidia extended a rare down stretch, as shares of the artificial intelligence colossus slipped into correction territory, a ding that comes as Nvidia’s trillion-dollar peers enjoy a robust period of gains. A Nvidia display in Shanghai. Nvidia stock fell 1.7% Monday to $132, its lowest end-of-day share price since Oct. 15. That’s 11% below the stock’s all-time closing high of $149 set Nov. 7, officially heading into a correction. Monday’s losses moved against a broader rally for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq index gaining 1.2% to a new record. And shares of each of the six other most valuable American companies – the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” group including Apple, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – gained at least 0.7% apiece, led by Tesla’s 6% rise. 5.7%. That’s how much shares of Nvidia are down since Election Day, far underperforming the S&P 500 index’s 5% gain during the period. Notably, the six-week stretch has been a strong one for Nvidia’s big tech peers, as each of the other Magnificent Seven stocks advanced at least 9.9%. There has been no singular catalyst for the Nvidia selloff – its earnings report last month exceeded analyst estimates across the board – though the stock has previously slumped due to geopolitical fears from Nvidia’s reliance on Taiwanese manufacturers. The recent dip for Nvidia shares may be hard to digest for investors, especially in an otherwise rosy market, but the stock’s longer-term returns are still eye popping. Nvidia’s 170% year-to-date return is the best of any company valued at more than $200 billion, according to FactSet data, with shares up a whopping 700% over the last two years. Nvidia rose to prominence over the last two years as the unquestioned market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, causing its market capitalization to grow from below $300 billion in late 2022 to as high as $3.6 trillion last month. Nvidia, whose clientele includes Amazon and Microsoft, translated the surging interest in generative AI into a significant upswing in its financial performance, as sales grew by more than 600% during Nvidia’s most recent quarter compared to 2022’s comparable period. Nvidia is still the third-largest company in the world by market value, trailing only Apple and Microsoft. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: 10 business leaders who spearheaded industry-transforming change in 2024

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 35 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually. The efforts also include introducing a mobile clinic that can go where routine and preventive care is needed and even provide wireless internet access so patients can confer with specialists. The clinic, which travels across southern Minnesota, offers virtual or in-person appointments. It has two exam rooms and a laboratory. "So now you have preventive exams, specialist visits that are occurring in very remote areas," she said. Varkey said Mayo Clinic Health System was also trying to bring medical expertise to rural residents through programs that connect small local clinics with specialists from hub sites or from Mayo's Rochester campus. Small clinics, she said, might have only a single nurse practitioner — nothing like the variety of disciplines a larger facility would have. "It's been very exciting to watch, and patients have really appreciated it as well," Varkey said. Another effort to meet patients where they are is the organization's hospital-at-home program. Varkey said remote monitoring technology helped these patients remain with family and be more comfortable than they'd be in a medical facility. "You get the same Mayo care," she said, adding that the approach had been popular with patients. Varkey, who also holds an MBA from the University of Minnesota, returned to Mayo in 2021 after serving as the president and CEO of Yale New Haven Health Northeast Medical Group. From 2001 to 2013, Varkey held leadership positions at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, including associate chair of the Department of Medicine, medical director of Ask Mayo Clinic, and program director of the Preventive Medicine Fellowship. Varkey said the expanding capabilities of AI and discoveries in genomics and molecular medicine were "taking healthcare to the next level — and very fast." While those developments are exciting, Varkey said, they shouldn't distract from the primary goal of patient-centered care. Kapila likes to stay ahead of the game. During the first 10 years of his career, the computer-science graduate completed four certifications each year while working as a tech consultant for firms like Nasdaq and Sallie Mae. While working at the hedge fund Citadel in the mid-2000s, he took MBA classes at night at Northwestern University. "Everything in this field changes so quickly," he said. "Things change in finance and things change in tech at an ever increasing pace." Now Kapila is a copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric, a pioneer of direct indexing with $570 billion in assets under management. He joined Parametric in 2019 after rising up the ranks at BlackRock, overseeing portfolio construction management for its widely used Aladdin platform. Kapila moved to a much smaller firm to have a bigger impact. "It was an opportunity to kind of look at what Parametric has done well, think about how to build on the success, but then also take advantage of what's happening in the technology space and rethink how Parametric could operate, let's say, five years from that point," he said. His move was well timed. There has been a boom in direct indexing, a tax-savvy investing strategy of buying individual securities modeled off an index like the S&P 500. Two years after Kapila joined Parametric, Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric's parent company, Eaton Vance. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized competitors such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said Parametric, founded in 1987, has experience and scale on its side. "I will say that given the technology trends, sometimes it's easy to come in and have a solution. It's much, much harder to have a scalable solution that will serve clients when the demand spikes," he said. "We're managing over 200,000 accounts for our clients. The level of scale, I think, often is a breaking point for some of the newer entrants." To stay ahead of the competition, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs fixed-income and equity portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. Kapila described it as a "turning point" for Parametric. "This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out."

Five months later, it's out, and the stock is down 8% on the news. Nasdaq said late Friday that Super Micro is being removed from the index, which is made up of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq and is the basis for the Invesco QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund, one of the most actively traded ETFs. The announcement is the latest in a roller coaster of a year for Super Micro, whose shares rocketed to a record high of $118.81 in March, as demand soared for the company's servers packed with artificial intelligence processors. The company's market cap reached over $70 billion, high enough to merit inclusion in the S&P 500. Super Micro is now worth about $20 billion, about a quarter the size of the median market cap of companies in the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq will also remove Illumina and Moderna from the group, effective Dec. 23. The revision will make room for the additions of Axon Enterprise and Palantir Technologies, as well as MicroStrategy, a company whose value is tied to its billions of dollars worth of bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy shares have gained more than 500% so far this year and were flat in Monday's trading. For Super Micro, the story started to turn in August, when the company said it wouldn't file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company and said in a report that it identified "fresh evidence of accounting manipulation." In October, Ernst & Young resigned as Super Micro's auditor, resulting in a 33% stock plunge. An independent special board committee evaluated concerns from Ernst & Young and found no misconduct following a three-month investigation. The report recommended the company replace its CFO. The company said in November that BDO was its new auditor. Super Micro was at risk of being delisted from Nasdaq altogether for a second time because of its delayed financial reports, but two weeks ago it received an extension until February 2025. In a preliminary earnings report, the company said revenue for the third quarter was up 181% year over year, below consensus. "Competition is strong, but I believe we are in good position," CEO Charles Liang said during a November conference call with analysts. Rivals include Dell and HPE.

Title: 6 Best AI Stocks To Buy In 2025

Time Published: 2024-12-16T18:55:36Z

getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Stephen Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions.

To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

The latest rally was spurred by Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, and an uplifting outlook for the first quarter. Broadcom, which sells semiconductors and infrastructure software, is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative artificial intelligence and reported a 220% jump in AI revenue for the year to $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analysts, who recommend buying Broadcom shares, lifted their 12-month target to $240 from $190, citing additional large customers for custom silicon. They also referenced management's execution following the $61 billion purchase of VMware, which closed last year. "We now have even higher conviction on the company's forward revenue and earnings growth outlook," the analysts wrote in a report dated Dec. 15. Barclays raised its priced target on the stock to $205 from $200, while Truist raised its call to $260 from $245. Broadcom shares are now up 126% for the year, closing at $250 on Monday. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the AI craze due to the popularity of its graphics processing units, or GPUs, is up more than 165% this year, reaching a market cap of $3.2 trillion. The Nasdaq has gained 34%. Broadcom refers to its custom AI accelerators as XPUs, which are different than the GPUs Nvidia sells. Broadcom said it doubled shipments of XPUs in the quarter to "our three hyperscale customers." The company does not name the customers, but analysts say the three are Meta, Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Title: 3 Enormous Supercomputers May Now Be In The Works

A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When I wrote about XAI’s Colossus project a few weeks ago, the scale of the initiative seemed, for lack of a better word, dizzying. You can look back at the video with Patrick from ServetheHome leading the audience through the halls of a supercomputing cluster ostensibly created to power XAI’s Grok chatbot: you can see row after row, rack after rack, of processors set in powerful motion, like a massive army, marching in lock-step and served with enormous amounts of electricity and water. According to recent news, a major vendor of AI hardware is now claiming that three of its major customers are planning projects on the colossal scale of Colossus. Broadcom reports that no fewer than three of its clients may develop data centers with 1,000,000 processors by 2027. This came from the company Q4 earnings call Dec 12, where leaders cited a 220% spike in revenue for the year. "As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years," President and CEO of Broadcom Hock Tan reportedly said on the call. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1,000,000 XPU clusters across a single fabric." For reference, Colossus started by reporting a need of 100,000 GPUs. After quickly doubling that order, Musk then came out with the frank update: that the center would require a cool million of the Nvidia GPUs that run there. Industry leaders like Jensen Huang marveled over the breakneck pace of the data center’s construction: so did notable journalists. It seemed like a unicorn. But is this kind of project, within the next few years, going to become de rigueur? The available reporting clarifies that there are no specific identifications of who is planning these enormous designs. Ask ChatGPT, and it will confirm this, although the model does give a list of top companies that it believes are more capable of scaling up these kinds of plans, including: · Nvidia · Microsoft · Amazon Web Services · Google · OpenAI · Meta · Tesla In addition, ChatGPT cites a collection of Chinese companies that have their own large data center capabilities, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. When you dig a little deeper, it looks like most of these companies are pretty far from this metric. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said that the company is aiming for about 350,000 data center GPUs by the end of this year. Google has estimated a total of 2 million GPUs in all of its global operations, not just one center. As for major clusters at AWS, where the hardware provides B2B services, one of the official numbers is that AWS has built a virtual supercomputer performing 9.95 petaflops, which looks like it would require a couple of hundred Nvidia H100s. So a million GPUs is still a really big deal. While the news is impressive, some are likely to be less than enthused about the idea of multiple data centers of this size. If we go back to Colossus, we have critics on the record talking about what they fear in terms of resource competition by this power-hungry behemoth. For one thing, Colossus is estimated to need up to 1,000,000 gallons of water per day - where you often see per capita municipal usage of around 100 gallons per day. There’s also the use of natural gas turbines to provide all of that energy… Experts have been suggesting for a while now that the U.S. is poised to expand nuclear power infrastructure, in order to power data centers, and specifically, to locate the power sources right next to the superclusters in order to make things more efficient. But even if they’re 100% efficient, it’s obvious that the power needs are going to be immense. As key journalists and others covering this issue have been pointing out, things are moving at an incredibly rapid pace. We’re going to have to figure out what impact these supercomputers are making on our society, because even though Colossus is the only one publicly identified as in the works, others are likely to be here soon.

Title: House Committee Says It Finds Evidence of ‘Climate Cartel’

The House Judiciary Committee said it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp. board members in 2021 after the company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon led by a firm called Engine No. 1 coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false,” said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so.” Last month, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov. 27. The committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the GOP’s attacks against ESG.

Red Cat shares rallied 27% on news that it's working with Palantir to integrate visual navigation software into its drones. The ticker RCAT has been the sixth-most-popular mention on Reddit's famed WallStreetBets page over the last 24 hours, behind only crypto play MicroStrategy, Nvidia, Tesla, Palantir and SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), according to data tracking firm Quiver Quantitative. RCAT's popularity on WSB has surged more than 1,625% in the past 24 hours, the firm said. Donald Trump Jr.-affiliated Unusual Machines was another big winner Monday, surging about 16%. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions added about 5%. Aerovironment gained 8%. The partnership news comes as recent sightings across the Northeast have reignited interest in the sector, while also fueling national security concerns. FBI officials on Thursday said there was "no evidence" that the drones jeopardize "national security and public safety." Officials also said Saturday that many of the sightings are "manned aircraft being misidentified as drones." Many on Wall Street view the incoming White House administration as a potential boon that could boost funding for the sector and U.S.-made drones. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spoken favorably of drone technology and is poised to play an influential role in President-elect Donald Trump's White House. "On the drone protection side, federal government counter-drone technologies are increasingly being used by local and state law enforcement to protect stadiums, airports, prisons, and other public settings," said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a note to clients. "This will likely result in a surge in counter-drone investments by local and state government agencies over the next decade." Investors have also come to view ties to the sector through Trump Jr.'s connection to Unusual Machines as another potential tailwind for the industry. The eldest son of the president-elect joined the advisory board of the company in November. Congress has also taken interest in the sector. The National Defense Bill, recently passed in the House, is also drawing interest. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed into law, China-based DJI would be barred from selling new drones to the U.S. — CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: How Walmart's $90 billion Sam's Club is aiming to take down Costco

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam's Club is riding the dual waves of Walmart's (WMT) rise as budget-conscious consumers flock to wholesale retailers. Led by CEO Chris Nicholas, who started in September 2023, the wholesale club founded in 1983 by Walmart founder Sam Walton has been a beneficiary of inflation-weary shoppers. In its most recent fiscal quarter, same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 7%, compared to a 3.8% increase in the same time period a year ago. Through the nine months ended Oct. 31, Sam's Club has hauled in $67.2 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in operating profits. Walmart's third largest business segment behind its namesake and international division is on track to post close to $90 billion in sales this year, according to analyst estimates. Parent company Walmart, with its own string of record-breaking quarters, in part powered by Sam's Club, is the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award winner. "We are the essence of the Walmart culture," Nicholas said. "We've spent the last year really getting after this really exciting growth agenda." Experts contend that one key aspect that differentiates Sam's Club from rivals like Costco (COST) and BJ's (BJ) is its investment in technology. "Costco is clearly the market share leader in the club space, ... we think Sam's Club is a formidable competitor," CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram told Yahoo Finance, "One area where Sam's Club is better than Costco currently is related to their technology, and that's because it's backed by Walmart, which is very technology savvy, unlike Costco." Sam's Club's Scan and Go technology, now rolled out in most locations, allows members to skip the checkout line. Shoppers scan items' barcodes on the app as they go along, pay in-app, and a member checks a few items to ensure they match the customer's order upon walking out. The Just Go exit arches do that job for the employees, using computer vision to quickly scan items as shoppers exit. Costco posted e-commerce growth of 13.2%, compared to Sam's Club 26% gain in the latest quarter. "You need to be technology savvy to win younger generations," Sundaram said. Nicholas has been in the retail industry for more than two decades. He started pricing goods at a grocery store in Hull, England as a 14-year-old. "The first day I was there, the store manager said to me, 'Listen, Chris, you've got to take this cage of goods and hide it because my regional manager is coming around this afternoon, and he doesn't know I bought all of this inventory,'" Nicholas recalled. "So I tell that story to my managers. I'm like, 'I'm watching you. Please don't do that.'" In 1983, Walton opened the first Sam's Club in Midwest City, Okla. His intention was to help other small businesses access products and services. It was also shortly after its competitor Costco (COST), then known as Price Club, made its debut in the 1970s in San Diego. As of November, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the US. Costco and BJ's Wholesale operate 625 and 266 stores in the US, respectively. Sam's Club also has 50 locations open in China, under the leadership of Walmart International CEO Kath McLay, with plans to open more in the country, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi. Here, Nicholas shares his thoughts with Yahoo Finance on Sam's Club's growth potential, what's working, and how it's investing in tech to compete. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Yahoo Finance: September marked one year since you became Sam's Club CEO. How would you describe your year? Chris Nicholas: Sam's Club is this little $90 billion business hidden in the corner of Walmart. You get to see the essence of our culture, and you get to do things as a pioneer, as an innovator, that you can only do because you're the little $90 billion company in the corner. [Our] growth agenda is focused on getting digital engagement with our members. ... Probably the thing that stands out most there is the digital engagement in the clubs and e-commerce, ... Scan and Go, and those Just Go arches. The third thing is great items, great value. [Private label] Members Mark would be the pinnacle of that. Sam’s Club had quite the year. Same-store sales in the recent fiscal quarter were up 7%, excluding fuel. What were the main drivers of growth? In the club business, the best health check you can have is how many members you've got and are they renewing. We're really happy that we've got all-time highs in membership and in renewal rates. ... [What] helped us grow even faster is this idea of experiences. ... There's been this idea ... that you can't have great experiences because it costs money. We really disagree with that. We've been investing really hard, whether it's leveraging the Walmart platforms or e-commerce and supply chain to building these new technologies that people are engaging with in unprecedented ways. In e-commerce, specifically, what is driving growth there? I've been in the e-commerce, retail business for more than 20-odd years now. It's not a new thing. Here's the thing, people want you to give them what they want. They want more. They want better items. They want more quality. They want lower prices. And they want you to serve them however they want to be served. Our job is to give them all of that, so if you have the choice, ... you can come into the club and shop, but if we can pick it for you, and you just pick it up, or we can deliver those items from the club to your home, or if you want an extended assortment, we can send them from the fulfillment center, but you still get Sam's Club prices. Sam's Club would be 20% to 25% cheaper than retail. You can get e-commerce delivered to your home, or you can pick it up, without the friction of shopping, at club prices. That's just an incredible value proposition, and we think is unmatchable. Are people still mostly going to Sam's Club for groceries? The tradition of the club model would be: You come with a flatbed or a big car, and you fill everything up, and you do it once a month. That's not the way that people shop us. Now, people are much more prone to come to us for the top-up shop, for the lobster mac and cheese and the bottle of Russian River Pinot or whatever that you want and hopefully pick up some GM [general merchandise] on the way. We think that we are not just a grocer, but we do enjoy that frequency of visit with our amazing fresh business and food businesses. On top of that frequency driver of grocery, ... you get the treasure hunt of general merchandise items, whether that's technology or wares or seasonal items or apparel. ... We want to be a GM business, a services business, and a grocer. Read more: Best credit cards for groceries (December 2024) Sam's Club is a membership model — who is its audience? At the heart of it, the Sam's Club member is [the] better-off-than-average family. ... We see great growth in our business members, we see exceptional growth with small, young families that are just coming through and starting their journey. Whilst we might tether on the wealthier shopper with family, we want to serve everybody. How is Sam's Club competing with rivals? Of course, Costco is such a prevalent player in the space. If you take a look at the whole of the club channel, that's less than 7% of total retail in the US. ... Whilst you can get better always by looking at your competitors and looking at what they're doing better than you, your main focus better be what your members are asking for. Trust is more important in the club model than anywhere, and the reason is because I'm asking you to pay me up front for the promise of value in the future. We spend a lot of time working on "How do you build an ecosystem that just takes all of the decision making away from you?" Because you just know you get the right value from Sam's Club, and then you go tell your friends, and then they come join. How is Sam's Club investing in technology? Think about the back end of your technology and the member-facing [part]. The back end is really difficult to invest in, [it] takes a long time, and it's really great that Walmart has already built a lot of those platforms. What we're doing is leveraging on the back end of the supply chain technology ... automation, the e-commerce technology — that's all of the stuff that they do in the fulfillment centers and the clubs but also the app that members use and our associates use. All of that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. I'm really grateful that we're part of Walmart, so we get to leverage that. That means the Sam's Club engineers are able to focus on creating disruptive, pioneering, delightful experiences for our members that we wouldn't be able to do if we didn't have that backbone, that back end. [At] CES last January, ... we announced that we were going to roll out these computer vision arches ... if you use Scan and Go, you can walk out [of the store] and there's zero friction. This year, we've used technology that's computer vision ... to take 100 million tasks out of our associates hands in clubs. We don't have fewer associates. They just don't have to do the mundane things they used to do: the paperwork, the clipboards, the how do you find the inventory? How do you solve problems for members? Are you thinking about artificial intelligence in that capacity? AI is everywhere. We've been working on AI for a long time. ... The Scan and Go is a great example of AI. We're using AI to help with search. We use AI to help with recommendations on the app, ... recommendations if you may have forgotten something. ... We're using AI to look at how you transacted with us before. AI is becoming rooted in everything that we're doing, but we're doing it in a way that's human, and I think that's a really important nuance for us. How are you thinking about potential issues ahead — like tariffs — under the new administration? We've got a limited assortment in Sam's Club, so that gives a lot of agility and flexibility, and our exposure to imports is insignificant. How about the reacceleration of inflation? What are you seeing there, and do you expect any change in 2025? My merchandise team [fights] every single day to reduce prices for our members. ... That is what the club model does. This is the moment for the Sam's Club business model. The Sam's model and the club model, in general, shouldn't make any money on what we sell, so the lower you can run your operation in terms of cost, the lower you bring your prices down and you make your profit from membership. It's a really cool model because what it means is that you get better items and sell them cheaper, you get more engagement, and those members then renew with you, and they tell their friends, and they come and join your club. This is why the club model is such a great place right now, and that's not just in the US. ... We see that globally.

Title: MicroStrategy Stock Jumps On Nasdaq 100 Inclusion—Bitcoin Giant Up 570% This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/16/microstrategy-stock-jumps-on-nasdaq-100-inclusion-bitcoin-giant-up-570-this-year/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z
Full Content:
Shares of MicroStrategy rallied Monday after the corporate bitcoin holder earned a spot in a key stock index, an apparent institutional vote of confidence in the company whose stock has been red hot amid the cryptocurrency boom. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor speaks at a 2021 conference. MicroStrategy stock gained 4% at market open, enjoying a bump from the Nasdaq announcing after Friday’s close that the Virginia-based company would join its Nasdaq 100 stock index next Monday. The inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, which is the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund, should result in about $2.1 billion in net buying of MicroStrategy shares as portfolios adjust to the move, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Also boosting the share price of MicroStrategy, which trades under the ticker MSTR, was a weekend rally for bitcoin, which hit a fresh all-time high Monday of over $106,000; almost all of MicroStrategy’s underlying value is tied to its bitcoin horde rather than a more traditional revenue-based business model. MicroStrategy stock has gained a robust 573% in 2024, outstripping bitcoin’s 150% gain and the S&P 500’s 29% return. Shares of the other two new Nasdaq 100 entrants, Axon Enterprise and Palantir, had less stark reactions, with Taser stun gun maker Axon stock up 1% and analytics-based defense contractor Palantir trading flat. MicroStrategy describes itself as the “world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Part of the dot-com boom at the turn of the millennium, MicroStrategy shifted its focus beginning in 2020 from its software business to becoming the most prominent voice advocating for bitcoin as a long-term store of value akin to gold. The company owns 439,000 bitcoins in its strategic reserve, equivalent to $46 billion, or 2.2% of the world’s total bitcoin supply. Some 40% of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins have been acquired over the last 40 days, according to Chhugani, dating back to the election of Donald Trump, an outspoken bitcoin ally. MicroStrategy has taken the rare step of issuing debt to fund its bitcoin purchases. “If you are not a Bitcoin believer, this is scary, but MSTR’s Bitcoin strategy is a long term high-conviction ‘buy & hold’ strategy with the view to hold Bitcoin till it surpasses Gold and beyond,” Chhugani wrote Monday. MicroStrategy certainly has its critics, including investment firm Citron Research, which announced a short position on MicroStrategy stock last month, calling the stock “overheated” and “completely detached” from bitcoin fundamentals. With a market capitalization of about $100 billion, MicroStrategy trades more than two times higher than its bitcoin holdings, with its other operations hardly offering much further support, as its software business brought in less than $120 million last quarter. 2,700%. That’s how much MicroStrategy stock has returned over the last five years. That easily outranks the roughly 2,200% and 1,600% gains from the S&P’s top performers during that stretch in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company Tesla, respectively, according to FactSet. MicroStrategy’s outspoken founder and chairman Michael Saylor is worth more than $10 billion, making him the 254th-richest person in the world. His net worth has more than doubled since March.

Mutual funds offer diversification, income and long-term growth potential. As investors seek professional portfolio management and diversification, mutual funds remain a cornerstone of long-term investment strategies for growth and income. For 2025, I've identified five outstanding funds that offer a combination of strong management teams, proven track records and attractive prospects across different investment styles and asset classes. My selection process focused on funds with consistent long-term performance, experienced management teams and reasonable expenses. I evaluated risk-adjusted returns, manager tenure, fund strategy consistency and asset growth management. Special consideration was given to funds that have successfully navigated different market cycles while maintaining their investment discipline and demonstrating strong risk management practices.

Become a Forbes member and get unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. Key Metrics: Led by legendary manager Will Danoff since 1990, Fidelity Contrafund employs a growth-oriented strategy focusing on companies with underappreciated earnings potential. The fund maintains a diversified portfolio of roughly 300 stocks, biased toward large-cap growth companies. Fidelity Contrafund's appeal stems from its exceptional combination of seasoned management and proven stock selection ability. Under Danoff's leadership, the fund has outperformed its benchmark in 24 of the past 32 years, generating an alpha of 2.9% annually over the S&P 500. The fund's proprietary research process, supported by Fidelity's 200-plus analyst team, has consistently identified emerging growth leaders early–including significant positions in Meta and Nvidia before their massive runs. Despite its large asset base, the fund has maintained its performance edge with a sophisticated trading approach that resulted in an implementation shortfall of just 0.15% in 2024. The strategy's focus on companies with sustainable competitive advantages has led to superior downside protection, capturing only 85% of market declines while participating in 95% of upside moves over the past decade. Key Metrics: Growth Fund of America utilizes American Funds' distinctive multiple portfolio counselor system, with each manager independently running a portion of the fund's assets. This approach combines diverse investment perspectives while focusing on high-quality growth companies. Growth Fund of America distinguishes itself through its unique multi-manager system and remarkable consistency. The fund's team of 12 portfolio counselors, averaging 25 years of experience, has delivered excess returns of 2.1% annually over its benchmark for the past decade. The multiple portfolio counselor approach has resulted in superior risk-adjusted returns, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.92 versus 0.78 for its peer group. The fund's low expense ratio of 0.62% is impressive given its active management approach and extensive global research capabilities. Portfolio construction excellence is evident in the fund's sector allocation decisions, which added 175 basis points of excess return in 2024. The fund's low turnover of 25% demonstrates its long-term investment approach, resulting in tax efficiency with a tax-cost ratio of just 0.45% annually.

Key Metrics: This fund focuses on undervalued small-cap companies with strong fundamentals and potential catalysts for value realization. The fund maintains a diversified portfolio of approximately 250 holdings across various sectors. T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value excels through its disciplined value approach and strong bottom-up security selection. The fund's research-intensive process, supported by T. Rowe Price's 45 small-cap analysts, has generated an alpha of 3.2% annually over its benchmark since current management took over. Portfolio positioning has been particularly strong in identifying value opportunities, with 85% of holdings demonstrating positive earnings surprises in 2024. The fund's capacity management is exemplary, having soft-closed at $12 billion to maintain investment flexibility in less liquid small-cap stocks. Risk management stands out with a downside capture ratio of 0.82 while still participating in 92% of market upside. The expense ratio of 0.79% is competitive for active small-cap management, especially given the fund's consistent value-add through security selection and tactical sector positioning. Key Metrics: The Pimco income fund employs a flexible approach to fixed-income investing. It seeks to generate consistent income while protecting capital in different market environments. The fund can invest across the entire fixed-income spectrum globally. This fund stands out for its sophisticated income generation and risk management approach. The fund's dynamic asset allocation process has delivered a remarkable track record, outperforming its benchmark by 175 basis points annually while maintaining lower volatility than peers. The management team's tactical positioning in 2024 demonstrated exceptional skill, particularly in duration management and sector rotation, adding 220 basis points of excess return. The fund's risk-adjusted performance is superior, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.15 versus 0.85 for its peer group. Despite its institutional-level expense ratio of 1.23%, the fund's consistent income generation and total return profile justify the cost. The fund's sophisticated hedging strategies have provided effective downside protection, limiting drawdowns to 45% of its benchmark during market stress periods. Key Metrics: As the nation's oldest balanced fund, Wellington takes a disciplined approach to asset allocation and focuses on high-quality stocks and investment-grade bonds. Vanguard Wellington's enduring success stems from its disciplined approach and exceptional cost efficiency. The fund's balanced strategy has delivered remarkable consistency, beating its benchmark in 18 of the past 20 years while maintaining a low correlation to broad market indices. The equity portion's focus on high-quality dividend growers has resulted in a portfolio with a 15% higher return on equity than the S&P 500. At the same time, the fixed-income allocation's emphasis on investment-grade corporate bonds has generated 85 basis points of excess yield. The fund's industry-leading expense ratio of 0.25% enhances its risk-adjusted returns, resulting in a Sharpe ratio of 0.95, top decile in its category. Portfolio construction excellence is evident in strategic asset allocation and security selection, with the fund's tactical shifts adding 125 basis points of excess return in 2024. These five mutual funds offer investors exceptional management talent across investment strategies and asset classes. From Fidelity Contrafund's growth expertise to PIMCO Income's fixed-income prowess, each fund brings unique strengths to a diversified portfolio. Their combination of experienced management, proven track records, and reasonable costs makes them compelling choices for investors seeking professional management in 2025.

Title: Super Micro's Shocking Fall: Nasdaq Exit, Stock Plunge, and Capital Raise Chaos
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micros-shocking-fall-nasdaq-141318949.html
Time Published: 2024-12-16T14:13:18Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. But the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical. Here's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Club name Honeywell said it is weighing a separation of its aerospace business split, exactly what activist investor Elliott wants. Would be huge for us. Another update on Honeywell's strategic review will come alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares rose more than 3% Monday. 2. Is the market hostage to absurd growth plays like Palantir, Applovin and even bitcoin? In my Sunday column for Club subscribers, I explored this idea. Think about the new additions to the Nasdaq 100. It's not just Palantir and corporate bitcoin holder MicroStrategy. A third one, Axon Enterprise, trades north of 100 times forward earnings. We'll discuss this more during our December Monthly Meeting for Club members on Thursday at noon ET. 3. President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs pledges are increasingly the only thing that business people will talk about, especially the potential for higher levies on goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico. That has been a particularly potent overhang on shares of Club holding Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beer. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article MicroStrategy announced today it had acquired 15,350 BTC worth around $1.5 billion between December 9-15, marking its sixth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases. The announcement comes ahead of its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, which takes effect next Monday. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 MicroStrategy funded the acquisition through the sale of 3,884,712 shares, generating net proceeds of about $1.5 billion, according to an SEC filing. MicroStrategy maintains $7.6 billion in available funds from its $21 billion at-market share sale facility for future Bitcoin purchases. The latest acquisition increases MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at $45 billion at current market prices, representing over 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The company’s Bitcoin investments have yielded strong returns, with a 72.4% yield year-to-date as of December 15. According to Google Finance data, MSTR has been among Nasdaq’s best-performing stocks this year, with a remarkable 547% year-to-date increase. This surge qualified the company for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. On December 13, Nasdaq announced its annual reconstitution of the Nasdaq-100 index, which saw three companies, including MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise, added. The market reacted positively, with MicroStrategy shares rising from $411 at Friday’s close to $434 in Monday’s pre-market trading, Yahoo Finance data shows. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will probably help MicroStrategy achieve its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is expected to have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Logging Off: The Tech That Died in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-16T13:00:00Z

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses.

December 16, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from an important diamond drill hole at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-337 is an exploratory hole drilled to a depth of 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project and the first hole drilled directly below the historic O’Brien Mine workings. At approximately 1,500 metres vertical depth it intersected sheared and mineralized rocks of the Piché Group, the dominant host rocks for O’Brien gold mineralization, and returned 242.0 g/t gold (“Au”) over 1.0 metre within a mineralized interval that averaged 31.24 g/t Au over 8.0 metres. Matt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “Following our “Jewellery Box” re-discovery news of December 9, 2024, we are taking the unusual step of releasing assays from another single drill hole today because of its particular significance to the future of the O’Brien Gold Project. Hole OB-24-337 was intended to be a pilot hole testing whether the Project’s host geology extended below the historic mine and to be a platform for future wedging and directional drilling. The fact that this hole intersected mineralization and visible gold at such a high grade greatly exceeded our expectations. Recall that approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. On September 24th we announced that drill hole OB-24-324 had intersected 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres at 1,100 metres vertical depth. Now, we have new gold mineralization in a classic O’Brien setting at 1,500 metres vertical depth, a full 500 metres below the deepest workings of the old mine. It is clear that O’Brien gold mineralization is extensive at depth, implying significant future upside potential for the Project.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-337 Figure 2: Long Section in Oblique View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Drill Hole OB-337 and Other Recent Deep Drill Holes Illustrated. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-337 Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts:The O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts from drill hole OB-24-337 presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Intercepts presented in the deep drill hole compilation in Table 2 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Seven deep drill holes or drill hole wedges have been completed since this time. Six of the seven returned instances of visible gold and five of the seven returned drill intercepts well above the Project’s grade cutoff in the March 2023 MRE. The holes were drilled at northerly declinations with initial inclinations of between -65 and -85 degrees, followed by angling to provide a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Deep drill results since September 2024, summarized in Table 2, have now included: and now: The frequency and grade of intercepts returned by these deep drill holes, as well as the observed host geology, its deformation, the style of alteration, and the mineralogical association of the gold mineralization, are all familiar from the historical O’Brien mine and consistent with the modern geological model developed at shallower depths. The implication is that characteristic O’Brien style gold mineralization is extensive at depth, well below the level of the historic mine workings and the current MRE. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on drilling complete to the end of 2022, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Monday, as investors looked ahead to an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut later in the week as well as several key data releases for clues on monetary policy next year. The Fed's final rate decision of the year is due on Wednesday, with traders pricing in an over 99% chance of a 25 basis point rate reduction, as per CME's FedWatch. Most megacap and growth stocks traded higher, with Google-parent Alphabet up 3.8% and Amazon.com rising 1.3%, boosting communication services and consumer discretionary sectors about 1.5% each. Both the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 0.8%. "The Nasdaq 100 has hit a fresh record high, and small-caps are in demand, as the final year-end chase gets underway, this is the 'Santa rally' almost right on cue," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG. Ahead of the Fed decision, investors awaited Tuesday's retail sales data and other key releases scheduled throughout the week. With a rate cut all but priced in, investors' primary focus will be on policymakers' outlook for next year as bets moderate on the pace of rate cuts amid strong economic growth and persistent inflation. "The S&P's year-to-date 26.86% gain far exceeds the average 10.05% annual gain since 1995 ... this jampacked week of important economic figures along with the FOMC meeting could be the game changer," said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial. Stocks have overall had a bumper run in 2024 as gains in artificial intelligence-related companies, the start of the Fed's rate cutting cycle and expected pro-business policies from Donald Trump's incoming administration have lifted equities. S&P Global's December flash PMI showed manufacturing activity stood at 48.3, while services activity was at 58.5, above estimates of 55.7. At 12:13 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.04 points, or 0.01%, to 43,823.02, the S&P 500 gained 24.04 points, or 0.40%, to 6,075.13 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 181.44 points, or 0.91%, to 20,108.16. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury briefly eased from an over three-week high before creeping back above 4.4%. Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the industrial conglomerate said it was exploring a separation of its aerospace business. Tesla leapt 5.4% after Wedbush Securities raised its price target on the stock to a Wall Street high of $515. Crypotocurrency stocks rose as bitcoin jumped above $106,000 after Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, and bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy was set to join the Nasdaq 100 index. MicroStrategy jumped 5%, while bitcoin miner MARA Holdings gained 8.8%. Super Micro Computer, among those set to be removed from the Nasdaq 100, dropped 6.9%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 141 new lows.

Title: Why Intel's Foundry May Be Set For A Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/16/why-intels-foundry-may-be-set-for-a-comeback/

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Intel stock has declined by over 55% this year and trades at just about $21 per share. While part of the sell-off has come due to Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and the broader industry pivot toward AI-focused GPU chips for data centers, the bigger issue for Intel has been its foundry business. Intel has invested about $25 billion into the business in each of the last two years and results have been hard to come by. The foundry reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue. That being said, a turnaround is well within sight, in our view. Intel’s next-gen 18A fabrication process technology is almost ready to roll out, and the company also appears to be a key beneficiary of regulatory support under the Trump administration given its strategic importance to U.S. technological independence. See why you should consider selling Nvidia and buying Intel stock. The Latest 18A Process Node Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. The chips using this process will be based on a 1.8-nanometer node size, putting Intel slightly ahead of TSMC’s N2 process which operates at a 2 nm node and is expected to arrive in the second half of 2025. While TSMC claims that its N2 process will outperform Intel’s 18A in some crucial areas, such as SRAM density (enabling it to store more data in a smaller physical area), Intel’s 18A’s backside power delivery gives it a competitive edge​ with reduced power loss and better thermal performance. Good news on the new chip’s progress, or bad news if delays occur, could increase volatility in the stock. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with large-scale production to begin thereafter. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Also see, Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? Although there have been rumors suggesting that chipmaker Broadcom, which has been testing out Intel’s 18A process, was disappointed with the yields of the new process, this was refuted by Intel’s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel says that its process shows defect density figures of 0.4 defects per square centimeter for now, which is only slightly worse than TSMC’s benchmarks of 0.33 defects on its legacy N7 and N5 nodes at comparable stages of development - roughly a year before entering high volume production. Given that the standard for this stage of development is typically below 0.5 defects per square centimeter, it means that Intel could be well within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be adequate for generating usable yields. Intel Foundry’s Rising Geopolitical RolePresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are also critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing footprint is likely to be crucial as it helps to secure U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that both designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. Intel won a $3 billion government contract to expand chip production for the U.S. military a few months ago, and there’s a possibility that this could scale up further under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Intel’s huge fab capacity and its newest process nodes could help domestic semiconductor designs better secure their supply chains as well. Take Nvidia for example. The GPU titan relies almost exclusively on Taiwan’s TSMC to produce its cutting-edge AI chips. TSMC is based in Taiwan, making production vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Intel, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, would mitigate that risk to a large extent. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Foundry Assets Provide A Backstop To Intel’s Valuation The semiconductor foundry business is risky given that management must make massive capital investment decisions based on predictions about future technologies several years before the demand for those technologies materializes. While Intel has seen major missteps with its current investment cycle, there’s probably a pretty limited downside for the stock at the moment. Intel’s stock currently trades at less than 1x its book value - essentially the net value of its assets after subtracting liabilities. This means the market is pricing Intel at just the value of its tangible assets while completely discounting its technological know-how in chip manufacturing and design, its increasing importance to national security, and its future potential. This creates an opportunity for investors who see potential beyond the company’s sizable balance sheet. Intel stock also trades at just about 21x its estimated 2025 earnings, which are depressed by its heavy foundry spending and recent market share losses. Earnings are projected at about $1 per share next year, down from close to $2 in 2022 and about $5 in 2021. As demand picks up, we could see a reversal in both earnings as well as Intel’s valuation multiple. Intel’s new co-CEOs say that the company’s Intel’s foundry business is in the process of being shifted to be a subsidiary, indicating that it could operate independently from the chip-design segment. The executives also indicated that the possibility of separating the foundry business from the rest of the company was an option in the future. This could also help to eventually unlock some value. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Intel’s valuation : Expensive or Cheap?

Title: New Investment Scam Leverages AI, Social Media Ads to Target Victims Worldwide

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new kind of investment scam that leverages a combination of social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI) powered video testimonials featuring famous personalities, ultimately leading to financial and data loss. "The main goal of the fraudsters is to lead victims to phishing websites and forms that harvest their personal information," ESET noted in its H2 2024 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity company is tracking the threat under the name Nomani, a play on the phrase "no money." It said the scam grew by over 335% between H1 and H2 2024, with more than 100 new URLs detected daily on average between May and November 2024. The attacks play out through fraudulent ads on social media platforms, in several cases targeting people who have previously been scammed by making use of Europol- and INTERPOL-related lures about contacting them for help or getting their stolen money refunded by clicking on a link. These ads are published from a mix of fake and stolen legitimate profiles associated with small businesses, governmental entities, and micro-influencers with tens of thousands of followers. Other distribution channels include sharing these posts on Messenger and Threads, as well as sharing deceptively positive reviews on Google. "Another large group of accounts frequently spreading Nomani ads are newly created profiles with easy-to-forget names, a handful of followers, and very few posts," ESET pointed out. The websites these links direct to have been found to request for their contact information and visually imitate local news media; abuse logos and branding of specific organizations; or claim to advertise cryptocurrency management solutions with ever-changing names such as Quantum Bumex, Immediate Mator, or Bitcoin Trader. In the next step, cybercriminals use the data gathered from the phishing domains to directly call the victims and manipulate them into investing their money into non-existent investment products that falsely show phenomenal gains. In some cases, victims are duped into taking out loans or installing remote access apps on their devices. "When these victim 'investors' request payout of the promised profits, the scammers force them to pay additional fees and to provide further personal information such as ID and credit card information," ESET said. "In the end, the fraudsters take both the money and data and disappear – following the typical pig butchering scam." There is evidence to suggest that Nomani is the work of Russian-speaking threat actors given the presence of source code comments in Cyrillic and the use of Yandex tools for visitor tracking. Similar to major scam operations like Telekopye, it's suspected that there are different groups who are in charge of managing each and every aspect of the attack chain: Theft, creation, and abuse of Meta accounts and ads, building the phishing infrastructure, and running the call centers. "By using social engineering techniques and building trust with the victims, scammers often outmaneuver even the authorization mechanisms and verification phone calls the banks use to prevent fraud," ESET said. The development comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities said they took down a large-scale fraud network that defrauded nearly $6.3 million from victims with fake online trading platforms as part of an operation called MIDAS. More than 20 servers utilized by the fraud ring have been seized and 32 people involved in the scheme have been arrested. Besides luring victims with SMS and phone calls, users of the illicit home trading system (HTS) programs were enticed into investing their funds by watching YouTube videos and joining KakaoTalk chat rooms. "The program communicates with the servers of real brokerage firms to get real-time stock price information, and uses publicly available chart libraries to create visual representations," the Financial Security Institute (K-FSI) said in a presentation given at the Black Hat Europe conference last week. "However, no actual stock trades are made. Rather, the program's core feature, a screen capture function, is used to spy on users' screens, collect unauthorized information, and refuse to return money."

Title: Webscale Network Operators Exhibit Robust Growth and Investment in Q3 2024

December 16, 2024 05:14 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 3Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (4Q23-3Q24), webscalers represented $2.53 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.1% YoY), $307 billion (B) in R&D spending (+6.5% YoY), and $254B in capex (+32.5% YoY). They had $631B of cash and short-term investments (-11.3% YoY) on the books as of September 2024, and $538B in total debt (-4.1% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of September 2024 was $854B, up 25.9% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.226 million (M) people at the end of 3Q24, up 2.3% from the Sept. 2023 total of 4.130M. Key Report Highlights: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 3Q24 were $638.6 billion (B), up 10.6% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.527 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For five straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 3Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 23.1% versus 4Q22-3Q23, followed by Microsoft (+16.4%), Alphabet (14.4%), and Amazon (11.9%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 3Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $15.8 billion from 3Q23 to end 3Q24 at $158.9B, up 11.0% YoY. The only curb on growth in 3Q24 was Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu, which recorded 3Q24 revenues of $5.8B, down $492 million (M) YoY (-7.8%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has grown at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 25%, 51%, and 58% YoY in the first three quarters of the year. 3Q24 capex of $75.6B pushed the annualized total to $253.9B, up 32.5% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 46% of annualized capex in 3Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 53% of total capex for the latest annualized period. The biggest capex outlays in 3Q24 came from Amazon ($22.6B), Microsoft ($14.9B), Alphabet ($13.1B), and Meta (FB) ($8.3B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 17.6% for the 3Q24 annualized period, a bit lower than a year prior (17.9%) but higher than the 14.1% booked in 3Q22. Average net profit margin for 4Q23-3Q24 was 18.9%, a bit higher than 16.9% in 3Q23. Both profitability metrics are around the same level as in the year before COVID. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft are regularly near or at the top of the heap on both metrics, and this was again the case in 3Q24. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. The biggest drops in free cash flow margins came at the companies with surging capex: Alphabet and Amazon. The biggest decline in net profitability was Apple, which was fined 13 billion Euros in September 2024 for taking illegal profits from a tax scheme in Ireland over two decades. This tax scheme has been widely known about and criticized for many years. While 13 billion sounds like a lot, it hardly impacted Apple's market trajectory at all. Apple's stock price is around 14% higher now than on 1 July 2024. Consumers and taxpayers are losing out, while big tech uses political friends to secure victories. This will get worse with new political leadership in the US. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in September 2024, slightly up from 4.13 million in September 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Amazon's workforce grew by 51,000 between September 2023 and 2024, for instance. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 3Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 3Q24 revenue growth was 5% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Another factor is TikTok. This company, owned by ByteDance, has grown at explosive rates for the last few years, but remains private. We have no reasonable way to include TikTok figures in our database. The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: The hefty bill for the banks, the MPs’ initiatives, and the whining about the Metro, the disgrace of the TV-lawyer, and the billionaire’s financial strains

Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:38:57Z

Greetings, well, it’s well-known that when K.M. takes charge of something, he doesn’t make mistakes or do sloppy work. That’s what happened yesterday during the budget discussion, where the measures he announced for the banks outshone any proposals from the opposition. But he also gave a social touch by imposing a “mandatory donation” of 100 million euros from the banks to support school infrastructure. So, Kyriakos Mitsotakis took things a step further and caught the bankers off guard with yesterday’s announcements. On fees for basic transactions (bill payments, dealings with the public sector, etc.), we’re looking at a complete elimination—not mere reductions, as initially expected. This is estimated to cost banks about 120 million euros annually, alongside the ENFIA (property tax) adjustment, as the Prime Minister mentioned legislative provisions to make this permanent. Add 100 million euros for the body that will manage properties of vulnerable borrowers and another 100 million for funding the renovation and construction of new schools, and the ENFIA adjustment. Altogether, the bill handed to the banks yesterday amounts to approximately 320 million euros. K.M.’s announcements, such as covering pharmaceutical expenses for low-income pensioners and granting a hazard allowance for uniformed personnel, were initially proposals from New Democracy MPs. Back then, they were labeled as “rebellious” initiatives, but the Maximos Mansion didn’t “criminalize” the suggestions. Instead, it processed them and is now implementing them. This way, the government showcases tangible actions, and the MPs can boast to their constituents that they influenced governmental decisions. The other day, there was a technical failure on a Thessaloniki Metro train. Passengers were inconvenienced, having to walk along the tunnel’s emergency corridor, which is specifically designed for such situations. The whole power outage lasted about 90 minutes, but the actual inconvenience for passengers was much shorter. Nobody truly claimed there was any risk to people because the power cut affected a Metro train. Yet, in Parliament, PASOK, SYRIZA, and the New Left (especially Haritsis, who pretends to be “modern”) raised a huge fuss. Honestly, I don’t think there’s another country in Europe where the opposition collectively blows up over a power cut in a single train on a completely new Metro system (and therefore bound to have some technical glitches). We’re talking about sheer ridiculousness! Six months ago, on a Sunday afternoon in early summer, the public was bombarded with reports about the arrest of a well-known TV lawyer who had almost beaten his wife and mother of his children to death. Initially, there were absurd excuses he gave during the investigation—claims that she “fell down the stairs”—but soon, under pressure from the police and investigators, she revealed the horrific truth. There was explosive media coverage for a few days. The coroner’s report revealed brutal beatings (17 punches to a woman’s face!). There were also dubious claims of psychiatric issues, and eventually, the whole thing faded out of the spotlight. Fast forward six months—before the year even ends—and this monster of a lawyer is appearing on TV shows as an angel. Look, here’s his new home, his new partner, and praise for his severely beaten ex-wife as a good mother, and so on. And life goes on. Now, you tell me: with a government that boasts laws against domestic violence and a justice system like ours, can anyone believe that things are improving in this country? Rot and corruption, or just the overwhelming sense that, in the end, everything here gets swept under the rug and left “half-resolved”? We still don’t have any progress on the issue of abolishing the Public Sector’s special rights in its 8.4% stake in the National Bank of Greece. The delay didn’t come from the Finance Ministry or the HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund). From the Greek side, all procedures are complete, and the delay stems from discussions between the ESM and SSM. The SSM doesn’t oppose abolishing the special rights, but the ESM wants to handle the matter in a way that fully safeguards their interests. So, it’s just a matter of time. Financial constraints—let’s put it politely—are plaguing the billionaire (?) Beny Steinmetz, also known as the “diamond king.” Word in the market is that he sold one of his two mines in Guinea (the operational one), as well as the nickel plant he owned in Skopje. Regarding the refinery in Italy, which even got the attention of the Financial Times, it was eventually bought by shipping magnate G. Economou because Steinmetz couldn’t come up with 140 million euros at the time. I’m telling you this to keep you informed since Greece doesn’t have many billionaires, and Steinmetz is one of them. Aside from being the diamond king, he’s also the king of arrests at airports (Israel, Cyprus, etc.), thanks to warrants against him. So, he’s spending his time in our country—not that he’s suffering, as he splits his days between a residence in Vouliagmeni (owned by a well-known Greek businessman) and his yacht. The regional airports packaged together Ultimately, the 22 regional airports will be granted as a single “package” to one operator. These airports will be released from the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) for concession via an international tender in the first half of 2025. Advisors for the tender have already conducted on-site inspections of the airport cluster (Karpathos, Chios, Alexandroupolis, Araxos, Limnos, Ioannina, Milos, Naxos, Paros, Ikaria, Kythira, Leros, Sitia, Nea Anchialos, Kalymnos, Skyros, Syros, Astypalaia, Kastellorizo, Kastoria, Kasos, and Kozani) to assess their current condition and identify needs to structure the tender framework. There is also consideration for some of these airports to be utilized for cargo transport or charter flights. Additionally, there is an intention for HCAP to retain a stake in the airports, similar to the Kalamata airport case. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as matters involving the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), though HCAP estimates that the concession process will be completed by the end of 2027. The €765 million PPP for the prisons In April, bids are expected to be invited from interested companies for the major €765 million Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project involving the relocation of Korydallos prison to Aspropyrgos. A prerequisite is the approval of the environmental terms. A positive development is the recent approval of a special urban planning framework. The project, managed by the Recovery Fund’s Maturity Unit on behalf of the Ministry of Citizen Protection, involves partnering with a private entity for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility for up to 30 years. Interest has been expressed by companies such as GEK Terna, Mytilineos, Aktor Concessions, and Avax, with the competitive dialogue nearing completion. The prisons will be relocated to a 100-acre property at the site of the former “American Convenience” military base in Aspropyrgos. The new premises and infrastructure for the modern Judicial Correctional Institution of Athens (JCIA) and the Attica Court Transfer Directorate (ACTD) will be located on the site of the old NATO base. End of an era Last year, Allianz stated that Christos Georgakopoulos, the founder of European Reliance, would remain a member of the board and an administrative advisor. However, his departure from the board of European Reliance-Allianz has quietly marked the end of his tenure. Tensions had arisen anyway, stemming from cultural differences between the German insurance giant and the Greek company. ADMIE board’s term extended Before the stock market opens today, ADMIE (the Independent Power Transmission Operator) will close the cycle of announcements for its nine-month results. Although the third-quarter financials are being released in mid-December, significantly late, they maintain expectations for a distribution of the remaining €14.5 million in dividends in September, along with the pre-dividend of €13.5 million. However, the key highlight is that by this time next year, the electrical connection between Attica and Crete will have been completed, generating an additional €770 million in annual revenue for ADMIE. Following the publication of the nine-month financial statements, a letter will be sent to shareholders regarding the renewal of the current administration’s term, resolving the final pending matter of the year. ECB halts bond purchases starting today Starting today, the European Central Bank (ECB) will permanently cease repurchasing bonds issued under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). This marks the ECB’s withdrawal from the European bond market as the largest buyer of eurozone countries’ debt. The ECB launched PEPP in March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak portfolio of €1.72 trillion two years later. Bond reinvestments were scaled back in July and officially end today, as the ECB wraps up for the holiday season. From now on, each issuer of debt—i.e., each individual country—will have to manage market fears and expectations, which will dictate the pricing of their bonds. The biggest challenge will likely be faced by France, where 52% of its public debt is managed by foreign investors and funds. France’s public debt already stands at 118% of GDP, and Paris will be seeking more than €300 billion (!) in 2025. Greece, on the other hand, appears to have managed its situation, with the €8 billion it needs to borrow next year not expected to pose a problem. The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) has planned only two new short-term bond issues and 10 re-issues on agreed dates. Industrial parks The prepayment (40% of the subsidy) from the Recovery Fund has been disbursed to ETBA Industrial Parks S.A. for the business plan aimed at developing industrial parks. elvoX automotive | mobility | technology is a Greek startup that designs and develops electric commercial vehicles—vans. Based in Acharnes, the elvoX team is striving to bring electric innovation to the commercial vehicle market. Reports suggest that this Greek startup has already attracted the interest of angel investors, mainly from the Middle East, for the development of its pioneering electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of urban and suburban professional transport, with the potential for future autonomous operation. Foreign investors are using Greece as a pilot “entry point” for research and development, prototype completion, and—if all goes well—the initiation of electric van production in Greece for the European market. Last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points (-0.2%), marking its 7th consecutive session of losses. This is the longest losing streak for the blue-chip index in nearly five years. This is happening during a period of general stock market euphoria on the other side of the Atlantic, where 46% of investors predict further price increases. However, at the same time, there have been record stock sales by major shareholders of Wall Street’s “champions.” For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon sold $1.25 billion worth of his company’s shares in November. In total, in 2024, Amazon’s founder and his close associates sold $12.5 billion worth of shares. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg liquidated another block of Meta shares worth $153 million. In 2024 alone, Zuckerberg sold shares of the company he founded worth approximately $2.4 billion. Meta is now valued at over $1.5 trillion for the first time in history, and the S&P 500 index appears poised to end the year with annual gains of around 24% or more. Meanwhile, top executives at NVIDIA have also announced stock sales worth $1.85 billion this year. A total of about 11 million NVIDIA shares have been sold since the start of the year, the most of any single company. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, revealed he sold 6 million shares. The question remains: who knows better? Those selling shares of the companies they lead, or those buying them? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED will conclude its two-day meeting this coming Wednesday. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Things will get more interesting next year, with less consensus on how the FED should address persistent inflation amidst concerns about economic growth. But that’s a problem for next year. For now, investors have the holiday season to look forward to. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday. However, Jerome Powell’s problem is much more complex. Currently, the average interest rate on U.S. government debt is 3.4%, the highest since 2008. The U.S. government is paying heavily for its borrowing. Over the last two years, U.S. debt interest rates have more than doubled. About $6.4 trillion of U.S. debt is in treasury bills with an average interest rate of 4.7%, while $14.4 trillion is in government bonds with an average interest rate of 2.8%. In reality, the total net interest cost reached an annualized record pace of $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. The U.S. government is spending $3 billion EVERY DAY just on interest payments. This may very well be the only reason Powell feels compelled to reduce dollar interest rates… Explore related questions

Title: MicroStrategy stock surges on Nasdaq-100 inclusion announcement
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microstrategy-stock-surges-on-nasdaq100-inclusion-announcement-3773636
Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:25:31Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) shares popped 6% in premarket trading Monday as investors welcomed the Friday announcement from the Nasdaq exchange operator that the stock will be added to the Nasdaq-100 index. The move follows a dramatic rise in the shares of the Bitcoin-focused company. The inclusion will take effect before the market opens on December 23. Being added to the index often boosts a stock price, as funds that track the Nasdaq-100 typically buy shares of the newly included firms to align with the index's composition. In addition to MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), a data analytics firm, and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), known for its Taser products, will also be added to the index. Meanwhile, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing equipment, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which specializes in AI servers, and vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) are set to be removed. MicroStrategy, which has aggressively invested in Bitcoin, has seen its stock skyrocket more than sixfold this year, boosting its market capitalization to nearly $94 billion. The company shifted its strategy in 2020, using Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid declining revenue from its software business. Today, it holds the title of the largest corporate owner of the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that MicroStrategy’s pivot to Bitcoin has made its stock more attractive, as its performance closely mirrors the cryptocurrency's fluctuations. Bernstein analysts predict that the Nasdaq-100 inclusion could pave the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion by 2025. They also see the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding they anticipate "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by optimism within the crypto sector following US President-elect Donald Trump's victory, which has raised expectations of reduced regulatory hurdles. Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time.

Title: Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy jumps on Nasdaq 100 entry

By Medha Singh (Reuters) -MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2% of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550% this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7% on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042% lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200% since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ENLV) and Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HOTH) have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Super Micro and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Photo Credit: Reuters MicroStrategy started buying and holding BTC in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned MicroStrategy will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer. The change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23, Nasdaq said. Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds looking to replicate the index's performance buy shares of the newly included firm. Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Taser maker Axon Enterprise were added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer and vaccine maker Moderna were removed, Nasdaq said. MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the world's largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion (roughly Rs. 7,97,387 crore). The company began buying and holding bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have said MicroStrategy's decision to purchase bitcoin to protect the value of its reserve assets has enhanced the appeal of its stock, which tends to align with the performance of the cryptocurrency. Bernstein analysts expect the market will likely set its sights on S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy in 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. The brokerage also sees the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding it expects "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has rallied in recent weeks as US President-elect Donald Trump's victory heightened the crypto sector's hopes for easing regulatory roadblocks. Earlier this month, the digital asset catapulted above $100,000 (roughly Rs.84.8 lakh) for the first time. "Management has shown no signs of slowing this (bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying bitcoin in the $95,000 (roughly Rs. 80.5 lakh) - $100,000 (roughly Rs. 84.8 lakh) range," Bernstein analysts said. The company held roughly 423,650 bitcoins bought for about $25.6 billion (roughly Rs. 2,17,148 crore) based on the average purchase price as of December 8. The investment is worth around $42.43 billion (roughly Rs. 3,59,905 crore), based on bitcoin's previous close, according to Reuters calculations. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus released in September for $150, but you can get this massive hardcover collection for only $82 at Amazon right now. By Steven Petite and Darryn Bonthuys on December 15, 2024 at 10:53PM PST Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus (Hardcover) $82 (was $150) Fans of Rocksteady's Batman Arkham games will want to check out Amazon's deal on the omnibus edition of the Arkham comics before the price jumps back up. The massive 1,648-page Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus released in September with a list price of $150, but Amazon currently has the hardcover book marked down to only $82. The 45% discount ($68 off) is by far the best deal yet on the omnibus collecting a treasure trove of comic book tales set in the world of the Arkham video games. Amazon says orders placed now (December 16) will arrive before Christmas, but make sure to double-check the shipping estimate if you're buying the omnibus for a Batman fan. The Arkham Saga Omnibus is far from the only awesome Batman deal available this holiday season. We've rounded up deals on Batman Lego sets, Blu-ray box sets, and the Meta Quest 3S Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle below the omnibus. $82 ($150) After Batman: Arkham Asylum became a huge hit in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into. This omnibus collects all of the Arkham comic book backstories, from the Dark Knight's first years on the streets in Batman: Arkham Origins to the dark and deadly stories of Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis and everything in between. The full list for this collection includes: These are all great miniseries and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games. Batman: Arkham Collection $7.49 (was $60) If you haven't played all three Arkham games by Rocksteady, you can get Batman: Arkham Collection for PC (Steam keys) for only $7.49 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical. The collection includes Arkham Asylum, Arkham City City, and Arkham Knight--sorry folks, no Arkham Origins--and an 86% discount is hard to beat. Not only do you get a selection of games that have aged well, you're also getting all of their DLC and expansion pass content as well. If you're up for a replay, you can unlock some superb concept art, character models, and more with these games. GameStop has Batman Arkham Trilogy for Nintendo Switch discounted to $20. Performance on Switch, especially Arkham Knight, is not great, but if the choice is play the series on Switch or don't play it at all, you should play it on Switch. Lego Technic: The Batman Batcycle (641 Pieces) $30 (was $50) Lego Batman Construction Figure & Bat-Pod Bike (713 Pieces) $52 (was $65) Lego Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $48 (was $60) Lego Batman Mech Armor + Minifigure (140 Pieces) $10 (was $15) Batman fans can save big on the Lego Technic Batcycle based on Robert Pattinson's ride in The Batman. Walmart is the only retailer that even has this 641-piece Lego set in stock, and the retailer is selling it for only $30 (was $50). The Batcycle is the best Batman Lego deal available right now, but you can also save 20% on a couple of other cool Batman kits featuring iconic vehicles from the film franchise. The Lego Batman Construction Figure and Bat-Pod Bike is on sale for $52 (was $65) at Amazon, while the Batman Animated Series Batmobile is available for $48 (was $60). Based on his appearance in The Dark Knight, the Batman Construction Figure is a buildable action figure that can attach to the functional Bat-Pod Bike. Together., the two builds add up to 713 pieces. The purple Batmobile is based on its iconic look from Batman: The Animated Series. This 435-piece Lego set includes three minifigures: Batman, Harley Quinn, and Mr. Freeze. Both of those sets released in August alongside the Batman Mech Armor Lego Set, a small 140-piece build that's discounted to only $10 (was $15) at Amazon. Batman 85th Anniversary 10-Film Collection On 4K Blu-ray $85 (was $205) Batman 80th Anniversary 18-Film Collection on Blu-ray $43 (was $90) If you're a fan of animated Batman movies, Batman's 85th Anniversary 10-Film Collection is on sale for only $85 at Amazon, which is its lowest price yet. The collection released in September and features 10 DC Universe Batman movies on 4K Blu-ray. You can also get the Batman 80th Anniversary 18-Film Collection on 1080p Blu-ray for only $43. You lose out on 4K resolution but get a bunch more movies. There's some overlap with these two box sets, so if you're interested in both, check out our full breakdown of the anniversary collections for more details. Here's a list of the best Batman 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD deals at Amazon. Some of these deals aren't quite as good as Amazon had during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but a bunch of them are pretty close. And in the case of the 85th Anniversary Collection, Amazon's current deal is actually better. Also, always-popular The Dark Knight Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray is only a few bucks more than its $30 Black Friday deal. The Batman Arkham series returned in October with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a virtual reality action game that's exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, which launched alongside the game. All new Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets come bundled with Arkham Shadow for free for a limited time. Amazon is sweetening the deal by throwing in a $30 digital gift card to use on your next purchase at Amazon. This offer is only available with the Meta Quest 3S 256GB for $400. You'll need to click "Redeem" button below the price on the store page or enter promo code QUEST30 to get the gift card. The Meta Quest 3S also comes with three months of Quest+, Meta's subscription service with a rotating library of games for members to play. You also get two free games each month, and those will remain in your library even if you cancel your subscription. At the moment, you're essentially getting seven free. games with the Meta Quest 3 and 3S. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB model costs $300. It doesn't include the $30 gift card, but it is the cheapest way to play Arkham Shadow. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin’s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk. The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies. Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it’s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results. They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it’s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia. They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world’s second-largest economy. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2% as law enforcement authorities pushed to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree, and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

It looks like we won’t have Cruise to kick around in this space anymore with the news that General Motors is pulling the plug on its woe-beset robotaxi project. Cruise, which GM acquired in 2016, fielded autonomous vehicles in various test markets, but the fleet racked up enough high-profile mishaps (first item) for California regulators to shut down test programs in the state last year. The inevitable layoffs ensued, and GM is now killing off its efforts to build robotaxis to concentrate on incorporating the Cruise technology into its “Super Cruise” suite of driver-assistance features for its full line of cars and trucks. We feel like this might be a tacit admission that surmounting the problems of fully autonomous driving is just too hard a nut to crack profitably with current technology, since Super Cruise uses eye-tracking cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead when automation features are engaged. Basically, GM is admitting there still needs to be meat in the seat, at least for now. Speaking of accidents, the results of the first aircraft accident investigation on another world were released this week, and there were a few surprises. Ingenuity, the little helicopter that hitched a ride to Mars in the belly of the Perseverance rover in 2021, surpassed all expectations by completing 71 flights successfully and becoming an integral part of the search for ancient life on Mars. But flight 72 proved to be a bridge too far and ended with a hard landing that terminally damaged its rotor system. At the time it was speculated that the relatively bland terrain it was flying over at the time of the accident was the root cause. This was confirmed by analysis of the flight logs, but the degree to which the flight computer’s down-looking navigation camera was confused by the featureless dunes is new information. As for why the rotor blades broke, it doesn’t appear that it was because they impacted the surface. Rather, as Scott Manley points out, the blades appear to have broken at their weakest point due to extreme flexing induced by the high vertical speed while touching down on a slope, which caused one set of legs to hit the surface before the others. Also roughly in the realm of space-based failures comes the story of a hapless senior citizen in New York who has been issued thousands of dollars in traffic tickets because of her love for Star Trek. Years ago, Long Island resident Beda Koorey got a New York vanity license plate for her car emblazoned with “NCC-1701,” the registration number of the USS Enterprise. She turned in those plates years ago when she gave up driving, but in the meantime, novelty NCC-1701 plates began popping up on Amazon and other sites. They were clearly not intended to be used on cars, but that didn’t stop some people from putting them on over their real plates in an attempt to defeat traffic cameras. It worked, at least from their point of view, since it left poor Beda with a collection of tickets for speeding and red light violations from as far away as Chicago. She even got a ticket for a violation committed by a motorcycle with a phony plate, which you think would not map to the registration for an automobile, but there you go. We always knew it was hard to be a Trekkie, especially back in the ’70s, but at least it never cost us much money. It did cost us a lot of dates, though. We featured plenty of stories of start-up tech companies with the next must-have IoT device that fold up shop after a few years and abandon their users by effectively bricking their widgets. Heck, we’ve even suffered that fate ourselves; curse you, Logitech, for killing the SqueezeBox. However, one company recently took IoT bricking to a new low by ending support for a line of AI-powered companion bots for kids. The company was called Embodied, and they hawked $800 AI bots for kids called Moxie, with a cute face and a huggable form factor that kids couldn’t help falling in love with. Embodied couldn’t make a go of it financially and since Moxie uses a cloud-based LLM to interact with kids, the bots are now bricked. This leaves parents who invested in these devices with the quandary of having to explain to young kids that their robot pal is dead. Some of the TikToks of parents breaking the news are heartbreaking, and we can’t help but think that this is a perfect opportunity for someone in our community to reverse-engineer these things and bring them back to life. And finally, the burning of the Yule Log is an ancient tradition, one that reminds us of the time our grandfather brought an entire telephone pole that had washed up on the beach home and burned it for days on end, feeding it slowly into the fireplace in the living room through the open front door. Good times. Not everyone is blessed with a fireplace in their abode, though, which has given rise to the popularity of video Yule Logs that you can just play on your TV. And now NASA is in on the action with an eight-hour 4K video of the SLS main engines and boosters. Framed by a lovely stone fireplace and replete with crackling wood sound effects over the subdued roar of the four RS-25 engines and twin solid-fuel boosters, it’ll make a nice addition to your holiday festivities. Although given that NASA just announced that the next Artemis missions are delayed until at least 2026, we’re not sure that it’s a great idea to show a rocket that never lifts off. You’ll also want to be careful that the neighbors don’t see the action. CGI fireplace, NASA, you can do better than that. They tried it with a real fireplace but it melted the house. Not just CGI, but really bad AI-generated fireplace. I just love a fireplace with a comforting basket of amorphous beige shapes in front, and a lumpy grate…thing… glued to the wall. The actual video footage is also only about three seconds being looped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-YhsEcQo Last year they did one that was just 45 minutes of RS-25 test footage with generic holiday music, which was honestly better. It seems like NASA has fired enough engines that it shouldn’t be hard to find a rocket engine filmed at a ridiculously high framerate so they could stretch a ten-second test into an hour or two of slow-motion. Could the air accident investigation be considered complete if JPL hasn’t recovered the “black box”? Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, so they just have to get it all out of thin air :o) You win. I was in SF a little while ago and was surprised to see that what seemed like every third car was a driverless Waymo or whatever they are called. So full driverless is absolutely still a thing and not at all impossible with current tech. Which really surprised me because I thought California banned all driverless cars.
