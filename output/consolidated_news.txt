Title: ‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again

The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight. In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto. According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream. With clearer rules, reduced risk, and rising institutional support, the digital asset market may be entering a new era of growth and maturity.

Title: Why the World Needs Bitcoin Now More Than Ever

A stylized representation of Bitcoin’s decentralized network. Bitcoin operates without central control, enabling financial freedom through peer-to-peer transactions. Bitcoin isn’t just an investment or a buzzword – it’s a beacon of hope and freedom in a world facing unprecedented economic and social challenges. Around the globe, people are confronting rising inflation, inequitable access to banking, costly remittances, and authoritarian financial controls. In this context, Bitcoin emerges as more than a technology; it is a movement empowering individuals with financial sovereignty. The following sections explore how, right now, Bitcoin is catalyzing economic inclusion, safeguarding value against inflation, streamlining global payments, empowering the oppressed, and spurring a revolution in decentralized innovation. The message is clear and urgent: the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever. 1. Economic Freedom and Financial Inclusion: Banking the Unbanked Billions of people worldwide remain unbanked or underbanked, locked out of traditional finance . This lack of access means missed opportunities and vulnerability to exploitation. Bitcoin offers a lifeline of economic freedom. With nothing more than a smartphone and internet, anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet and join the global economy . There are no gatekeepers demanding paperwork or minimum balances – Bitcoin’s network is open to all. In places where banking infrastructure is weak, Bitcoin is filling the gap. Nigeria is a powerful example. Despite over 55% of Nigerians lacking bank accounts, the country ranks second worldwide in crypto adoption . An astonishing 47% of Nigerians aged 18–64 have used cryptocurrency, the highest rate globally . Young entrepreneurs in Lagos or Kano aren’t waiting for banks – they’re using Bitcoin to start businesses, pay bills, and store savings in a way that was impossible before. Even a government ban couldn’t stem this tide; peer-to-peer Bitcoin trade flourished until the ban was lifted in late 2023 . This grassroots movement shows Bitcoin’s inclusive power: it is simply the most efficient way for many Nigerians to conduct daily transactions, from buying groceries to paying for phone credit . We see a similar story in El Salvador, where about 70% of the population was unbanked prior to 2021 . By making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador enabled millions of citizens to leapfrog into digital finance via mobile wallets. Suddenly, a single mother in a rural village – previously without any bank access – can receive payments or remittances on her phone and participate in the economy. The motivation was clear: “help the 70% of Salvadorans who are unbanked” by allowing anyone with a phone to transact . This bold step has turned El Salvador into a living laboratory for financial inclusion, inspiring other countries to explore Bitcoin for the same reason. Bitcoin is economic empowerment. It democratizes finance, giving individuals control over their money regardless of status or location. From subsistence farmers in Africa to gig workers in Southeast Asia, people are downloading wallets and unlocking opportunities. They can save without fear of local bank failures, transact across borders, and access global markets directly. As the World Economic Forum noted, cryptocurrencies are building “open, democratic financial systems” that can include the 1.7 billion+ underbanked people through low-cost, automated services . In short, Bitcoin is banking the unbanked, igniting hope in communities long left on the margins. The world urgently needs this inclusive financial revolution to continue growing. 2. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Times Around the world, families are watching their hard-earned savings melt away as inflation soars. In these trying times, Bitcoin shines as digital gold – a safe haven asset with a hard cap that governments cannot debase . Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million coins. This built-in scarcity makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and instills confidence that one’s savings won’t be eroded by central bank policies . As a result, more people are turning to Bitcoin as a store of value when traditional money falters. We see this vividly in countries suffering hyperinflation or currency collapse. In Venezuela, years of economic mismanagement led to one of history’s worst hyperinflations at over 1,000,000% . The Venezuelan bolívar became virtually worthless – but Bitcoin offered a lifeline. Venezuelans began converting their rapidly devaluing cash into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to preserve whatever value they could. By 2020, Venezuela ranked third globally on the crypto adoption index due to the sheer volume of bolívar-to-Bitcoin transactions . Everyday people used Bitcoin to protect wages from inflation, with bank deposits losing value “in weeks or even days” otherwise . As Reuters reported, in Venezuela “crypto has become a tool to send remittances, protect wages from inflation and help businesses manage cash flow in a depreciating currency” . In short, Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for many Venezuelans, acting as a palliative for economic disaster when nothing else was available. Argentina provides another compelling case. Long plagued by inflation, Argentina recently saw annual inflation spike above 100%, the highest in decades. In response, Argentinians have rushed into cryptocurrency as a hedge. By mid-2023 an estimated 5 million Argentines (over 10% of the population) were using crypto regularly . Data shows that as the Argentinian peso plunged, crypto purchases shot up, peaking when inflation crossed 100% for the first time in thirty years . Many people now take their paycheck and immediately convert it to Bitcoin or stablecoins to escape the peso’s loss in value . One local exchange executive explained, “We have really high inflation… That makes crypto a valuable option for saving” . For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers something their national currency cannot: trustworthy long-term value. It’s telling that even in a bear market for crypto, Argentina led Latin America in transaction volume precisely because of this need to survive hyperinflation . What makes Bitcoin so attractive in these scenarios is financial sovereignty. As Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein observed, if you hold Bitcoin in your own wallet, “governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you” . People living under double- or triple-digit inflation have discovered this truth firsthand. Bitcoin’s design guarantees that no central authority can erode its value by printing more. This provides an essential hedge, especially during hyperinflationary spirals when prices double in weeks and local currencies collapse. Even in more stable economies, the post-2020 era of stimulus and rising prices has woken people up: in the U.S. and Europe, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as “digital gold” to diversify portfolios and guard against the highest inflation in 40 years. Historical data show that interest in Bitcoin spikes during inflationary periods , reflecting its growing reputation as “a hedge against traditional market downturns” . By offering ordinary people a way to preserve wealth, Bitcoin is fulfilling one of its most important promises. Whether it’s a middle-class family in Turkey watching the lira crash, or a professional in Lebanon who saw banks freeze their accounts (and wished they’d held Bitcoin ), individuals are learning that Bitcoin can secure their financial future when local systems fail. In a very real sense, Bitcoin is hope: hope that one’s lifetime of savings can be saved from the silent theft of inflation. As more people recognize this, Bitcoin’s role as the 21st century store-of-value will only grow – a stabilizing force in an unstable world . 3. Cross-Border Payments and Remittances: Fast, Low-Cost Global Transfers Every year, migrant workers and families worldwide lose billions of dollars to high fees and slow processes when sending money across borders. Traditional remittance services often charge 5-10% per transaction and can take days to clear . For the people relying on these funds – often small amounts for food, education or medicine – those fees hurt the most. Bitcoin offers a game-changing alternative: near-instant, low-cost international transfers that can empower families and boost entire economies. Consider El Salvador again. Remittances from workers abroad make up a whopping 20% of El Salvador’s GDP , but much of that used to be skimmed off by money transmitters. By embracing Bitcoin, El Salvador aimed to dramatically cut remittance costs for its people. Using the government’s Chivo wallet or Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, Salvadorans can now receive money from the U.S. in seconds, with virtually no fees – a stark contrast to lining up at Western Union and paying hefty commissions . This means more money in the pockets of low-income families and rural communities. As President Bukele touted, a construction worker in California can send $100 back home and nearly the whole $100 arrives, rather than $85 after fees. Enabling direct Bitcoin remittances has been life-changing for households that depend on that extra cash for daily needs. It also exemplifies how Bitcoin makes global commerce more fair: it doesn’t discriminate between a bank transfer of $10 or $10,000, and it never takes a cut based on percentage. Across the globe, other countries are similarly leveraging Bitcoin and crypto for remittances. Mexico, one of the world’s largest remittance destinations, has seen a surge in crypto-fueled transfers. In 2022, the exchange Bitso processed over $3.3 billion in remittances from the US to Mexico via crypto, about 5.4% of total flows . That 5% share – achieved in just a few years – translated into millions of dollars saved in fees for Mexican families. Importantly, these Bitcoin-based remittances arrive in minutes rather than days, and receivers in Mexico’s villages can convert to pesos or keep Bitcoin as they choose. The convenience and speed are a game changer. It’s no wonder that other Latin American countries with large U.S. diasporas (like Guatemala or Honduras) are exploring similar avenues, and companies like Strike are building Bitcoin Lightning solutions specifically to link U.S. earners with families back home in the developing world. In Africa, where remittance fees are the highest in the world, Bitcoin and stablecoins are truly transformative. Many Africans working abroad have shifted to sending money home via crypto because it can be 40-60% cheaper than using a traditional remittance corridor . For example, sending $200 in the legacy system might cost $20 or more in some African routes, whereas doing it with Bitcoin or a dollar-pegged crypto costs just a few dollars – and arrives the same day. Startups have sprouted across Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana to facilitate these transfers, often using Bitcoin’s network as the backbone beneath user-friendly apps. The result is that families can receive more of what their loved ones earn, helping pay for schooling, healthcare, and local business investments. But remittances are only part of the story. Cross-border commerce and payments are also being revolutionized by Bitcoin’s network. Small exporters and freelancers in countries with restrictive banking can now get paid directly in Bitcoin from international clients, sidestepping delays of wire transfers or unfair currency exchange rates. A designer in Lagos or a coder in Dhaka can offer their services globally and receive value in minutes, opening up opportunities previously blocked by banking friction. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a secondary layer for instant micropayments, has further enabled things like pay-as-you-go services, streaming money for content, and tipping creators across borders with negligible fees. These innovations point to a future where sending money is as easy as sending an email – a future Bitcoin is actively creating today. The world urgently needs faster, fairer payments, and Bitcoin is delivering. By stripping away the artificial barriers and tolls in the legacy system, Bitcoin lets migrants support their families more effectively and lets value flow to where it’s needed most. It’s profoundly inspiring to see a grandmother in the Philippines receive a Lightning payment on her phone from her grandson overseas, or a community in Senegal fund a well via global Bitcoin donations, all with minimal overhead. This is financial connectivity as it should be: inclusive, efficient, and empowering. As more people discover how easily and cheaply they can transact globally with Bitcoin, the pressure will mount on old remittance providers to lower costs – a positive force Bitcoin has already set in motion. 4. Political and Social Empowerment: Sovereignty Under Authoritarian Regimes Imagine living under a regime that controls every aspect of your life – even your ability to access money. In many authoritarian and crisis-hit countries, people face financial repression: frozen bank accounts, capital controls, surveillance of transactions, and the ever-present threat of asset seizure. Here, Bitcoin’s value is not just financial – it’s profoundly human. Bitcoin provides a form of money that no dictator can easily control, giving dissidents, activists, and ordinary citizens a tool to reclaim their freedom. As one activist put it, “Bitcoin is bad for dictators”, because it’s money that empowers the people . Time and again, when repressive governments have tried to cut off their citizens from resources, Bitcoin has ridden to the rescue. In Nigeria, during the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, authorities froze the bank accounts of activists to stifle the movement . But young protesters quickly turned to Bitcoin for fundraising after seeing their local currency access blocked. Within days, Bitcoin donations from around the world were keeping the protests alive, paying for food, medical supplies and legal aid – all beyond the government’s reach. Nigeria’s youth effectively said: “If the banks won’t let us raise money for justice, we’ll use Bitcoin, which no one can censor.” This marked one of the first major instances where a social movement was funded by cryptocurrency out of necessity, showcasing Bitcoin’s power as censorship-resistant money. Even as the government tried to clamp down (at one point even ordering crypto accounts frozen), organizers kept routing funds through Bitcoin until their voices were heard. In Belarus and Russia, opposition groups and journalists have similarly leaned on Bitcoin to survive crackdowns. When authoritarian regimes blacklist dissident organizations from financial services, they assume they can starve them out. But with Bitcoin, an independent media outlet or an NGO can keep operating, paying contributors and receiving support from abroad, without a single bank having to approve. Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation notes that “so many people…have essentially been saved or rescued because of this technology” . His organization started recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as early as 2013, when Ukrainian protesters in Kyiv faced bank freezes and found that Bitcoin could still get funds to them on the ground . In his words, “Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful tool against authoritarian control”, offering ordinary people an alternative when regimes would otherwise trap or devalue their money . No story illustrates this better than that of Venezuela’s medical workers in 2020. Amidst economic collapse and COVID-19, Venezuela’s authoritarian government was blocking aid money for doctors and nurses – refusing assistance for political reasons while these frontline workers earned just a few dollars a month. The opposition-led team found a clever solution: they used cryptocurrency to bypass the regime and deliver aid directly. They set up Bitcoin (and stablecoin) wallets for thousands of healthcare workers. Funds from international donors were sent to these wallets, and trusted community members (termed “human ATMs”) helped the recipients convert to usable local currency . This Bitcoin-fueled aid program succeeded in getting $100 per month to 65,000 desperate doctors and nurses – an absolute lifeline when the average salary had plunged to just $5 . The government could neither intercept nor stop this relief, as it was happening on a decentralized network outside their control. Think about that: tens of thousands of families were sustained because Bitcoin enabled humanitarian aid without borders. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s potential as a weapon against oppression, delivering hope where conventional channels failed. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and self-custody mean that you and you alone control your money. If you hold your own Bitcoin keys, no bank, no court, not even a superpower can freeze your account or block a transaction. For people in Hong Kong, Iran, Afghanistan, and other repressive environments, this is incredibly empowering. It means a journalist can escape their country with their savings intact on a USB drive or memorized seed phrase – whereas carrying cash or gold would get confiscated at the border. It means a refugee can receive support directly from supporters worldwide, even if the local regime wants to choke them off. And it means communities can build a degree of economic autonomy, using Bitcoin in local circular economies, that lets them endure sanctions or financial blockades. As Gladstein has bluntly stated, Bitcoin strips authoritarians of a key lever of control. “With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to [financially] manipulate and control people is completely decimated,” he explains . A government can’t inflate away your wealth if it’s in Bitcoin, and they can’t freeze what they can’t find the keys to. Indeed, “no government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it”, as one Lebanese survivor of hyperinflation observed – and that could have saved many in his country’s collapse . This is why Bitcoin is increasingly called “freedom money”. It is giving people an exit door from tyrannical systems. Each time an oppressed individual opts out of the state-controlled currency, they reclaim a bit of power over their own life. We should be clear: Bitcoin alone won’t topple dictators overnight. But it evens the playing field by denying dictators total financial dominance. It provides a plan B for those bravely working for change – a way to sustain themselves and their missions when traditional means are cut off. This has a profound psychological impact too: just knowing there is an alternative builds resilience. In the words of one Togolese activist, people in autocracies turn to Bitcoin because “it helps bypass financial repression” and gives them hope for a more free future . By empowering civil society and weakening the grip of repressive governments over finances, Bitcoin is quietly fueling a revolution in human rights. The world needs this “money of freedom” today, because so many are still fighting for their basic dignity under harsh regimes. Bitcoin is their ally – our ally – in the timeless struggle for liberty. 5. Technological Innovation and Decentralization: A New Era of Trust and Opportunity Bitcoin isn’t just changing finance; Bitcoin is changing the world by introducing a revolutionary model of trust through technology. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network in 2009, few understood that this was the dawn of a new era – the era of decentralized innovation. Today, we recognize Bitcoin as the foundation of a global shift: a shift towards systems that are open, transparent, and not reliant on any single authority. This technological paradigm is unleashing creativity and economic opportunity on a scale reminiscent of the early internet. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin sparked the Fourth Industrial Revolution in finance, one centered on decentralization and digital scarcity. At its core, Bitcoin solved a problem long thought impossible: it created digital scarcity. For the first time, there was a digital asset that could not be copied endlessly, that people could trust to hold value like a physical commodity. This breakthrough – “the birth of digital scarcity” – underpins Bitcoin’s value . With a hard limit of 21 million coins, Bitcoin established a reliable, programmatic monetary policy that anyone in the world can verify. This scarcity, combined with robust security, means Bitcoin can serve as a foundation for wealth creation and preservation in the digital age . It has inspired an entire ecosystem of innovation: thousands of cryptocurrencies, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and more – all tracing their lineage back to Bitcoin’s fundamental breakthroughs. Yet Bitcoin remains unique and irreplaceable, the most secure and widely adopted of them all . As an OSL research piece put it, Bitcoin’s “unique properties, such as scarcity, decentralization, and security, contribute to its status as a digital asset that cannot be replicated.” Decentralization is the beating heart of Bitcoin’s technology. By operating on a global network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners, Bitcoin eliminates the need for any middleman or central server . Transactions are verified by the consensus of the network participants, not by trusting a bank or government. This has enormous implications. It means the Bitcoin network is extraordinarily resilient – there’s no single point of failure that could bring it down . It means transparency – every transaction is recorded on an open ledger (the blockchain) that anyone can examine, reducing the chance of fraud. And it means empowerment – “it empowers individuals by giving them control over their own funds,” free from the fees and whims of intermediaries . In practical terms, a farmer in India can trade with a developer in France and a designer in Brazil directly, with each party trusting the math and the network, not having to know or trust each other beforehand. This trustless transaction capability is revolutionary; it removes friction and fosters a new era of global commerce and collaboration. Bitcoin’s decentralized design also drives security and immutability. The network is secured by advanced cryptography and a proof-of-work mechanism that makes altering confirmed transactions virtually impossible . Unlike centralized databases that hackers often breach, Bitcoin’s blockchain has never been compromised in its history. Once a transaction is settled in a block, it cannot be changed or erased . This gives users an unprecedented level of confidence in the integrity of their money. Funds can’t just vanish because of a bank’s error or a government’s whim – the Bitcoin ledger is ironclad. Each additional participant and each additional use case only strengthens the network (through what’s known as the network effect): as more people use Bitcoin, it becomes more valuable and useful, which attracts yet more users in a virtuous cycle . Already Bitcoin has the largest, most battle-tested computing network on Earth securing it, making it one of the most secure assets ever devised. This level of security is what allows Bitcoin to function as digital cash and digital gold simultaneously. And as the network grows, we see more businesses and even nations exploring it, knowing that they can plug into a financial protocol that is robust and globally accessible. Beyond Bitcoin itself, the innovations spurred by Bitcoin’s principles are reshaping technology and finance. The rise of the Lightning Network, for instance, has made Bitcoin payments ultra-fast and scalable, enabling a wave of creativity in micropayments and small-value use cases. In 2025, the Lightning Network reached new heights, reportedly processing over 100 million transactions in a single quarter as adoption accelerated . This layer-2 solution allows people to send tiny fractions of a cent instantly – something not feasible with traditional payment rails – which is opening up possibilities like pay-per-stream content, micro-tipping for social media posts, and machine-to-machine payments in the Internet of Things. As Lightning and similar technologies mature, Bitcoin is evolving from just a store of value to a full-fledged payments and innovation platform. Crucially, Bitcoin has catalyzed a movement towards decentralized governance and open-source development in finance. It proved that a community of globally distributed contributors can maintain and upgrade a monetary system without any CEO or central authority. This is inspiring new governance models in other domains (think decentralized autonomous organizations for everything from art to insurance). In essence, Bitcoin taught the world that trust can be built into code – and that people anywhere can cooperate to run critical infrastructure (like money) by consensus. The cultural impact of this cannot be overstated: “Bitcoin serves as a symbol of resistance against centralized control and government overreach”, representing a vision of a future where financial freedom and sovereignty are accessible to all . It has ignited the imagination of millions – engineers, economists, futurists – who are now pushing the boundaries of what decentralized tech can do, from reinventing banking to creating new social networks free of censorship. The world needs Bitcoin’s innovative spirit urgently. Traditional financial systems, with their siloed ledgers and 20th-century technology, struggle to keep pace with today’s digital economy. Bitcoin and the technologies it birthed offer a leap forward, much like the internet did for information. They promise financial services that are more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure. They also promise new economic models that reward participation and merit over privilege and monopoly. We are already seeing early glimpses: developing nations using Bitcoin to stabilize their economies, tech startups building on Bitcoin to bank the unbanked, and even forward-thinking governments crafting laws to accommodate this innovation rather than stifle it. By embracing Bitcoin’s decentralized paradigm, societies can unleash entrepreneurship and give individuals greater agency in the economic realm. This is a positive-sum game – one where everyone can benefit from a more open and innovative financial system. At a time when trust in institutions is low, Bitcoin offers a trust in technology as an alternative, and it’s proving to be trust well-placed. The momentum of Bitcoin’s technological revolution is unstoppable, and joining it means stepping into the future of finance with optimism and confidence. 6. Global Relevance: A Worldwide Movement from Developing Villages to Developed Cities Bitcoin’s impact and adoption are not confined to one type of economy or one region – it is a global phenomenon, touching lives in developing countries and developed capitals alike. What’s truly inspiring is how Bitcoin means different things to different people, yet it brings them together under one monetary network. In struggling economies, it’s a lifeline and an equalizer. In wealthier nations, it’s an agent of change and a hedge for the future. Across continents, a diverse tapestry of Bitcoin use cases is emerging, proving that this technology is broadly relevant and adaptable to local needs. Below is a snapshot of key regions embracing Bitcoin today, and the primary drivers behind their adoption: Table: Key Regions Adopting Bitcoin and Their Drivers of Adoption Sources: Adoption data from Chainalysis and national reports ; inflation and unbanked stats from World Bank, IMF, and local sources . As the table illustrates, Bitcoin’s appeal is truly global and multifaceted. A rural villager in Kenya might cherish Bitcoin for giving her a safe savings vehicle outside any bank. A software engineer in San Francisco might value Bitcoin as an investment and a statement of support for open technology. A shopkeeper in Turkey could accept Bitcoin from tourists to avoid the lira’s volatility, while a college student in Ukraine might use Bitcoin donations to fund relief efforts during a crisis . In each case, Bitcoin is solving a problem or enhancing lives in ways that weren’t possible before. It’s particularly noteworthy how Bitcoin adoption often surges in response to crises or limitations of the traditional system. In Lebanon’s recent financial meltdown, for instance, when banks imposed strict withdrawal limits and the local currency crashed, interest in Bitcoin surged as a lifeline . People realized that had they held savings in Bitcoin, no bank could have prevented them from accessing their money, and the value wouldn’t have been tied to Lebanon’s failing policies . Similarly, during currency scares in Turkey and Nigeria, Bitcoin trading volumes hit all-time highs as people scrambled for stability. These aren’t speculative manias – they’re signs of urgent need. When trust in government money falters, Bitcoin stands in the gap. And even in stable countries, events like bank failures (for example, the 2023 U.S. regional bank crisis) or concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privacy have driven more people to hold Bitcoin as a sovereign money option just in case. It’s a grassroots insurance policy that’s catching on everywhere. Perhaps one of the most uplifting aspects of Bitcoin’s global rise is the sense of unity and community it fosters. Bitcoin has built a global network of advocates and educators crossing all cultural and political lines. A farmer in rural India and a banker in New York might have little in common – until they start discussing Bitcoin, and suddenly they share this vision of a more open financial future. Conferences, meetups, and online forums brim with enthusiastic collaboration – developers improving the technology, economists debating its impact, ordinary people sharing stories of how Bitcoin changed their lives. This bottom-up energy is contagious. It’s turning Bitcoin from just a currency into a global movement for financial empowerment. We see governments starting to pay attention (and some, like El Salvador, taking bold steps), largely because they realize this is driven by people’s genuine needs and aspirations. In summary, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, São Paulo to Stockholm, Bitcoin is proving its relevance. It adapts to local contexts: serving as a currency here, a store of value there, and a network for innovation everywhere. The world has never had a truly global, people-powered financial system before – and now it does in Bitcoin. This universality is why the world needs Bitcoin now. It is the common thread of financial hope running through so many disparate struggles and dreams on our planet today. Conclusion: A Hopeful Future with Bitcoin In this moment of global challenge and change, Bitcoin rises as a beacon of hope and a tool for empowerment. It offers a path toward greater economic freedom, where anyone can participate in finance without permission or prejudice. It offers relief from the silent theft of inflation, giving ordinary people a way to safeguard their life’s work. It tears down costly barriers in moving money, reuniting families with more of their hard-earned wages. It strengthens those who dare to speak out against tyranny, ensuring their voices can’t be silenced by freezing their funds. It pioneers a radical new trust model – one rooted in math and consensus rather than fallible institutions – unleashing innovation and inspiring collaboration worldwide. And it does all of this through a single, open network that welcomes every citizen of the world. The urgency cannot be overstated. As we’ve seen, people are using Bitcoin today to overcome real hardships – feeding their families in inflation-ravaged countries, raising funds for noble causes, or simply accessing opportunities long denied to them. The status quo has left too many behind and let too many down. Now, Bitcoin gives us a chance to course-correct – to build a fairer, more inclusive global financial system from the ground up. It is not controlled by the powerful; it is owned by all who use it. In Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos, we glimpse a future where technology empowers the many, not the few. This report has laid out why the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever, but the truth is even simpler: the world needs hope, the world needs freedom – and Bitcoin is delivering both. From a young woman in Latin America finally able to save for her education, to a father in Africa sending money home without extortionate fees, to an entrepreneur in Asia launching a startup via global crowdfunding, Bitcoin is lighting up lives with new possibilities. It instills a sense of optimism and agency – the feeling that yes, we can take control of our financial destiny. That energy is infectious and unstoppable. We stand at a crossroads in history. Down one path, we stick with old financial structures that are creaking under their own weight, often exclusionary and prone to crisis. Down another path, we embrace the Bitcoin-led revolution – an open, resilient, people-centric financial future. The choice is becoming clearer by the day. Around the world, millions have already chosen Bitcoin as their lifeline and their inspiration. They chose it because it answered a deep need that nothing else could. Now is the time for all of us – individuals, communities, and forward-thinking leaders – to recognize this urgent call. Bitcoin is here to stay, and its positive impact is only growing. By championing Bitcoin and the ethos it represents, we champion a world of greater justice and opportunity. As the examples and data have shown, this is not theoretical; it is happening right now. The world needs Bitcoin, today, to continue breaking down barriers and uplifting those in need. If we seize this moment, we can usher in a brighter, more inclusive era of human prosperity. In the powerful words of one Bitcoiner, “Bitcoin isn’t just money – it’s hope.” Let us embrace that hope. The world needs Bitcoin, and together we can carry this torch of freedom forward, energized and united by the promise of a better tomorrow. ₿LOG ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Rachel Fehily: Why are the experiences of people born, like me, in Temple Hill forgotten?

I spent the first three months of my life in a contested space: Temple Hill in Blackrock, Dublin, commonly known as St Patrick’s Infant and Dietetic Hospital. It is contested because there is a fundamental disagreement as to its historical purpose: there are two different retrospective interpretations of its function. To this day the Government insists that it was a hospital; but in reality, it was an adoption home for infants and babies. It was stated in a parliamentary question in the Dáil by Sinn Féin TD Claire Kerrane last year that: “Temple Hill does not qualify for supports, redress or recognition because it was a hospital, yet babies were adopted and paid for on foot of newspaper advertisements. Many children went to America. I have never heard of a hospital that does that.” Despite the indisputable fact that many children were adopted from Temple Hill through the former adoption society St Patrick’s Guild, and some were resident for lengthy periods of time, it is one of at least four institutions excluded from the Mother and Baby Institutions payment scheme as it was not on the initial list of homes investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. The fact that it was not an institution within the meaning of the terms of the commission and no mothers resided there with their babies (apparently they were taken from them at the door) kept it out of its terms of reference. I am not seeking a payment under the scheme or looking for redress personally, because I left Temple Hill with my adoptive parents at the age of three months. I was fortunate to grow up with six siblings – five adopted, also from the same location – in a stimulating and supportive environment, but I am advocating for people who have been left out. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated that the official commission report was flawed because many institutions were excluded. Its remit was too narrow. In an “alternative report”, a team including survivors, activists and eminent academics wrote that its “text excluded significant cohorts of affected people” and that “it is regrettable that the Commission did not request to modify its terms of reference to permit deep engagement with a wider range of organisations”. Minister for Children, Disability and Equality Norma Foley will have a chance to review the operation of the scheme within six months of its second anniversary, by September 2026. Many of the now-ageing adults who were resident and abused in institutions and identify themselves as “survivors” in need of the supports offered by the scheme are currently left in limbo. I had the pleasure of meeting the Irish artist Bernard Canavan, a recipient of the prestigious Presidential Award for his contribution to Irish culture in the UK at the Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, London. He recently held an exhibition at The United Arts Club in Dublin entitled Theocracy. His paintings represent the trauma that he and others endured in institutions. He was a long-term resident of the same Temple Hill in Blackrock, more than 25 years before me. Despite evidence of his abuse, neglect, lengthy period of residency at Temple Hill, and his advanced age, he is excluded from the payment scheme because of “contested” definitions. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has set up a comprehensive curriculum resource on “mother and baby homes” for the Junior Cycle. It developed it in collaboration with groups involved in advocating for survivors of “historic” institutions. This is an important and worthwhile initiative. The list of related literature for the English curriculum is comprehensive and impressive, including the novel Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan and the play An Trial by Máiréad Ní Ghráda. The curriculum has input from many survivors and is all the better for it. However, the framing of the curriculum comes directly from the NCCA, a statutory body of the Department of Education. At the launch, Minister for Education Helen McEntee said: “It is vital that our young people learn about the history of this State in every aspect, and in order to provide this teaching and learning, teachers must be supported with resources such as this one.” One of the resources for Junior Cycle teachers - a series of slides, maps, a list of the homes included in the Commission’s report - omits the contested homes. Much of the lengthy reading list that goes with the teacher supports comprises “official” reports. Searching through the voluminous reading list, I eventually found an alternative “List of Institutions, Agencies and Personnel Involved in Separating Unmarried Mothers from their Children.” It is collated by Claire McGettrick and the Justice for Magdalenes Research and Adoption Rights Alliance. The database includes St Patrick’s Infant Dietetic Hospital (aka Temple Hill). It is vital that students understand how our Government and legal system operates to include and exclude people from access to justice. These nuances matter. If school children are taught to think critically they might be driven to question as to whether their history curriculum is in fact “history” or “current affairs”? In Fintan O’Toole’s excellent recent article on the excavation of the Tuam site, he writes that: “This is making history in a double sense – doing something that has never been done before while simultaneously reshaping a country’s understanding of its own recent past. And, hopefully, of its present.” It seems ironic that the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four has been removed from the Senior Cycle curriculum for 2026 by the Department of Education, while Greta Gerwig’s film Barbie has been deemed worthy of inclusion. Leaving Certificate students won’t have to read George Orwell’s text or consider one of its most memorable lines: “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.” But they will have a chance to consider this dialogue by Weird Barbie: “That Ken of yours, he is one nice looking little protein pot … I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans.” Rachel Fehily is a barrister, lecturer in literature and justice at UCD and is engaged in interdisciplinary creative-based doctoral studies supported by Research Ireland © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The best restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/07/16/the-best-restaurants-around-ireland-worth-travelling-to/
Time Published: 2025-07-16T05:00:00Z

The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Read our full review here. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. Read our full review here. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. Read our full review here. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. Read our full review here. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. Read our full review here. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. Read our full review here. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Naysayer Vanguard Makes Bold Bet On Strategy Stock–Details

In a twist that few saw coming, Vanguard has quietly become the top shareholder in Strategy (MSTR). The $10 trillion asset manager now owns just over 20 million MSTR shares. That adds up to nearly 8% of Strategy’s Class A stock. Vanguard once warned that Bitcoin was “immature” and carried “no inherent economic value.” Now it finds itself deeply tied to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin play. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard didn’t set out to back Saylor’s moves. It simply follows its index‑fund rules. When Strategy’s stock climbed, it grew larger in the indexes that the company tracks. The result: Vanguard had to buy more shares. Through its broad‑market funds, the asset manager ended up with a stake worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It shows how passive strategies can lead to active positions in unexpected places. Vanguard’s CEO Tim Buckley once said that Bitcoin “could wreak havoc on portfolios.” He argued that the flagship crypto lacked the history and solid ground that long‑term investors need. Yet Vanguard’s own track record of following index weights means it can’t shy away from a stock that’s on the rise. No matter the fund’s view on Bitcoin, the rules forced its hand. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC. Each share of MSTR represents a slice of that giant pile of Bitcoin. For anyone holding Vanguard’s indexes, that means indirect exposure to more than half a million coins. Since 2020, MSTR stock has climbed around 3,400%. That surge helped push the firm’s market value up fast enough to land in Vanguard’s top holdings. Large investors often use ETFs or purpose‑built products to get Bitcoin exposure. Vanguard could have joined the likes of BlackRock in launching a spot Bitcoin ETF. But it declined. Instead, it finds itself holding a big chunk of Strategy. That makes it an unwitting part of the Bitcoin story, even if it wasn’t the path the firm’s managers originally chose. The fact that Vanguard is now the largest shareholder of $MSTR is proof that God has a sense of humor, or at least that was my reaction to @VildanaHajric who wrote story about it out today pic.twitter.com/TLg4iqT3kQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 14, 2025 Michael Saylor sees this as a sign that institutions are coming around to Bitcoin. He told Bloomberg that Vanguard’s stake is “a powerful signal” of acceptance. For years, many big firms treated Bitcoin as a niche asset. Now they’re tied to its fortunes through Strategy’s public shares. That shift may encourage others to take a closer look. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed up the irony on X, saying “God has a sense of humor.” He pointed out that Vanguard’s index approach means it must own all the stocks in its benchmarks—whether it likes them or not.

Wednesday, 16 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh inflation data and a wave of earnings reports from major financial institutions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points, or 0.98 percent, to close at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 fell 24.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,243.76. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 37.47 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,677.8, marking a new all-time closing high. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in the red. Materials and health care were the biggest decliners, falling 2.11 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively. Technology was the only sector to finish higher, gaining 1.27 percent. June's inflation data, released Tuesday, showed consumer prices rising 0.3 percent for the month, in line with expectations and up from May's pace. The annual CPI rate stood at 2.7 percent. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, climbed 0.2 percent from the previous month and 2.9 percent year over year, both matching analysts' forecasts. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report come in line with expectations, but "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy. On the earnings front, several major banks delivered underwhelming results. Wells Fargo beat profit expectations but issued lower guidance for net interest income, pushing its shares down more than 5 percent. JPMorgan Chase also posted strong results but saw its shares slip. BlackRock dropped 5.88 percent after missing revenue estimates. Citigroup stood out, gaining 3.68 percent after beating second-quarter earnings expectations. In the tech sector, Nvidia surged 4.04 percent after announcing it would resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, following White House assurances that current export restrictions would be eased. The news sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 6.41 percent, Arm Holdings and Broadcom each added less than 2 percent, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF climbed 1 percent. Among other mega-cap tech names, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon posted modest advances. Tesla declined 1.93 percent, and Meta Platforms lost 1.46 percent. Thank you for your report!

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Title: Rise of Zohran Mamdani has Wall Street giving up on Gotham

The NYC Partnership threw a party — but no one really showed up. A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. There was once a time that CEOs of this caliber would want to meet the likely next mayor of the city. Now, it’s resignation — a bet that New York City is a lost cause, and a belief that the Partnership, run by the retiring Kathy Wylde, is an increasingly impotent advocate to turn back the increasingly leftist political class. Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Yes, they want the current mayor Eric Adams to stick around — ethical warts and all — because he’s the devil they know and they like his very competent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But Adams faces an uphill climb, all the more so because Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the primary, is leading what they see as a Quixotic run as an independent. Curtis Sliwa, the GOP nominee, is going nowhere fast. The polls, for now, show a likely Mamdani mayoralty, combined with a leftist city council and a state government that veers nearly as far left as Zohran. All which spells disaster for those businesses who stay: Police defunding, higher taxes and government takeover of businesses like supermarkets. And that gets us to why there were so many no shows Tuesday: the city’s business community doesn’t have to stay. If you follow these big firms, as I do, you know they employ hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — but fewer and fewer in recent years. The harsh COVID lockdowns here gave them the excuse to move operations to places with lower taxes and regulations, mainly Florida and Texas, but also Utah and even Tennessee. Mamdani will be another reason for the big banks to finally say goodbye to Gotham.

Title: Disabled children suffered higher rates of sexual abuse, Dáil hears during debate on historical abuse

Children with disabilities experienced sexual abuse at a much higher rate than children without a disability, the Dáil heard as it debated historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion Michael Moynihan said the scoping inquiry leading to the newly established Commission of Investigation revealed the records of religious orders showed “some 528 allegations of historical child sexual abuse across 17 special schools in respect of 190 alleged abusers”. The initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. The Minister of State said “many families entrusted the care of their children into these communities” and “this is unlikely to be the full extent of the historical abuse in special schools”. It was “truly appalling that the additional vulnerabilities of children in special schools could be so exploited and there has to be accountability”, Mr Moynihan said. He was speaking during a debate on the motion to approve the draft order on the Commission of Investigation on the handling of historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. [ Government will ‘pursue all levers’ to make religious orders pay redress to victims of school sex abuseOpens in new window ] Sinn Féin TD Pat Buckley said he had lost many friends who had been abused and it took more than 20 years to find out what happened. “I lost two friends in primary school where the abuse started and I wasn’t aware of it.” He said “people ran away from school, came back, qualified as solicitors and everything, and unfortunately ended their lives”. He said some of the people who are responsible “are still alive, some of the principals and vice-principals, Christian Brothers and lay teachers”. Labour’s Ciarán Ahern said the Government and other institutions of power “have excelled in the past at covering up the reality of child sexual abuse”. “We need only look at the Carrigan report in 1931 to see the DNA of denial that blighted child protection in Ireland from the State’s foundation”. The Dublin South-West TD said the Carrigan committee was appointed in 1930 and held 17 sessions. One witness, the police commissioner of the time, “highlighted an alarming amount of sexual crime, increasing yearly, a feature of which was the large number of cases of criminal interference with girls and children from 16 years and downwards, many children under 10 years of age”. He said the police commissioner believed that less than 15 per cent of sexual crime was being prosecuted but government chose not to publish the report. Minister for Education Helen McEntee thanked “every single survivor for their bravery, whether they were in a position to come forward or not”. She also thanked the late Mark Ryan and his brother David who came forward for the RTÉ documentary Blackrock Boys, after which the Government established a scoping inquiry. In an address to survivors she said: “I am truly sorry for what was done to you and the devastating impacts it had on your lives, but I want to thank each and every person for their bravery.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

(Photo: AP/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK: The Nasdaq Composite posted a fresh record close on Tuesday (Jul 15), lifted by a surge in shares of Nvidia, even as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones slipped amid lukewarm inflation data and mixed bank earnings. It was the tech-heavy index's fourth record close in five sessions, and its eighth since Jun 27. Artificial-intelligence chip leader Nvidia gained 4 per cent after it unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China. The news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both gaining more than 6.4 per cent. The semiconductor index also advanced 1.3 per cent to its highest point in a year, while the S&P technology index climbed by the same percentage to hit a record high. "The Nvidia news meant that some investors, who had moved into other stocks due to high tech valuations, were rotating back," said Rob Swanke, senior investment research analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network. "I would probably say it's a one-day pop," he added, noting that investors would look to see the sales reflected in upcoming earnings. The Nasdaq Composite added 37.47 points or 0.18 per cent to end at 20,677.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points or 0.98 per cent to 44,023.29, and the S&P 500 lost 24.80 points or 0.40 per cent to 6,243.76. Markets have been buoyant in recent weeks as concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies eased. However, this week is seen as a key test, with second-quarter earnings and inflation data in focus. US consumer prices posted their largest gain in five months in June, suggesting tariffs may be contributing to rising costs. Still, underlying inflation remained moderate, offering investors some relief. "The picture from inflation this morning, coming in a little bit higher than expected but pretty much in line, gives you some sense that the tariffs are starting to flow through into the economy," said Commonwealth's Swanke. "We'll get more concrete news, as we go through earnings, to see how companies are delivering the impact of higher tariffs." The second-quarter earnings season opened on a muted note. JPMorgan Chase slipped 0.7 per cent despite raising its 2025 net interest income outlook, while Wells Fargo fell 5.5 per cent even as its profit improved due to reduced loan-loss reserves. BlackRock reported a new milestone in assets under management, but its shares slid 5.9 per cent. Citigroup bucked the trend, climbing 3.7 per cent to its highest finish since the global financial crisis, after its trading division delivered a strong performance that lifted second-quarter profits. The number of shares changing hands on US exchanges on Tuesday was 16.82 billion, compared with the 17.55 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Title: Is Ethereum’s $3K rejection a spark for ETH’s next breakout?

Ethereum’s dip might be less a setback and more a springboard. Ethereum just saw a 2% dip and heavy liquidations, yet Open Interest and ETF inflows suggest strong underlying conviction. BlackRock alone added 50,970 ETH as capital quietly rotates from Bitcoin. Ethereum [ETH] just took a 2% hit and got rejected hard at a key resistance level, and suddenly $3,000 is looking more like a local top than a launchpad. In fact, that drop wiped out $82.28 million in longs, nearly 80% of the day’s liquidations. And there’s still $47 million hanging by a thread, ready to go with even a minor dip. Typically, you’d expect a deeper flush in Open Interest (OI) after that kind of leverage reset. But interestingly, OI has barely budged, down just 0.55% from its record $43.94 billion the day before. Source: CryptoQuant Zoom out a bit, and the setup feels familiar. Back then, Ethereum’s OI held steady through a tight consolidation zone between $2,640 and $2,450. The result? A breakout rally that pushed ETH up 20% in under two weeks, alongside a fresh OI peak. Now, throw in another $260 million into spot ETH ETFs, bringing the total to nearly $1.1 billion over just four trading days, marking the strongest run since their launch last July. Put it all together: Futures positioning is holding strong, spot inflows are ramping. Clearly, someone’s leaning in while the broader market hesitates. Could this be a move the rest of the market hasn’t priced in yet? For the first time ever, Ethereum’s strategic reserves have crossed $4 billion, with 1.11% of the supply now concentrated in just 50 entities. BlackRock’s latest buy of 50,970 ETH worth $150 million only adds fuel to the narrative. And it might not be random timing. The ETH/BTC ratio has posted two straight green candles, hinting that as Bitcoin [BTC] struggles at resistance, capital could be quietly rotating into Ethereum. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) The divergence shows up in the data, too. Bitcoin’s Open Interest has dropped 3.72%, with the price now 5% off its $122k high. Meanwhile, ETH has kept its OI drawdown to just 2%, showing more stability under pressure. If that relative strength holds, Ethereum could be setting up for another leg higher, using this 2% dip as a springboard for a breakout above $3,000.

Title: "Everybody's jobs will be affected" — but NVIDIA's CEO believes society can think its way out of AI-related job loss

It's going to take every bit of society's ingenuity to save our jobs from the machines. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating and terrifying subject. While AI brings positive gains for our little planet we call home, there's also a good chance it will cause massive unrest as it gets smarter and becomes a much better employee than you or I. Besides the ever more frequent reports of significant layoffs and outright job losses in the wake of AI's rise, the heads of many of the leading AI firms are also sounding the alarm. But is the situation as bad as some of AI's most powerful players are making it out to be? NVIDIA is currently the hottest commodity on the AI market right now, as its chips are the ones that everyone wants powering their AI models. NVIDIA recently became the first $4 trillion company, made possible largely by the ongoing AI race. That gives NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's comments on AI a lot of weight. Huang was recently interviewed by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, in which Huang expressed a bit of optimism alongside some pessimism about AI and the impact it's having on jobs (via Tom's Hardware). All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. "If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translate to job loss," said Huang, as he responded to a question about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's current outlook on job replacement. "The fundamental thing is this: do we have more ideas left in society? And if we do, if we’re more productive, we’ll be able to grow." Huang is, of course, responding here to Amodei's opinion that AI could slash up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs. The quote (via Axios) from Anthropic's Amodei doesn't sugar-coat the current outlook for the future: "We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming. It's a very strange set of dynamics, where we're saying: 'You should be worried about where the technology we're building is going." Reading through this battle of words, it doesn't seem like Huang is exactly debating Amodei's idea that AI could push employment rates beyond what we've ever seen. Instead, Huang believes that the workforce, just like it has done plenty of times in the past during technological revolutions, will endure on the back of our ingenuity. Huang reminds us that "even in the era of computers," there has been a rise in productivity and employment. "Everybody's jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created, and what I hope is that the productivity gains that we see in all the industries will lift society," said Huang. This isn't the first time that Huang has responded to Amodei's beliefs in a public manner. Huang, in a previous interview at VivaTech 2025, stated: "I pretty much disagree with almost everything he [Amodei] says. He thinks AI is so scary, but only they should do it." Huang and Amodei are far from the only significant AI figures spreading the same ideas. Bill Gates has said that he believes generative AI will eventually be able to take over traditional human roles in the workplace, leaving us, organic beings, useless for most things. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that he believes entire job sectors will go extinct as AI continues to grow, while Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has stated that he believes coding jobs could be gone within two years. I certainly see where these CEOs are coming from; their technology has the potential to completely rewrite human progress, and they don't want to be skewered for negative fallout when it does. However, on the other side of the argument, these CEOs could be using this doom-and-gloom strategy as a marketing tool. There is little risk to CEOs making grandiose predictions of job cuts that will appease shareholders, given that even if these claims are untrue that there won't be much public backlash. How everything plays out remains to be seen, but Huang's opinion that all jobs will be affected doesn't seem too far off. A 2024 Adecco Group study on 2,000 C-Suite executives from around the world demonstrates that 41% of those polled believe they will employ fewer humans within five years because of AI. Only 46% of executives asked say they plan to move human workers replaced by AI to new roles. So, what jobs will those displaced by AI take on? I don't have an answer, but Huang believes that we, as a society will figure it out. Worried about your job? Just think harder!

Title: Trump Joins Tech and Energy Leaders as US Pushes to Expand AI

World President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he leaves the White House, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Washington. (Photo: AP/Manuel Balce Ceneta) PITTSBURGH: US President Donald Trump will join executives from leading technology and energy firms at a high-profile summit in Pittsburgh on Tuesday (Jul 15), as the White House accelerates plans to boost artificial intelligence (AI) and expand data centre infrastructure. The Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, brings together top officials from Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, ExxonMobil and others, amid intensifying global competition with China over AI dominance. Trump is expected to announce some US$90 billion in AI and energy investments in Pennsylvania during the event, which was organized by US Senator Dave McCormick, a key Republican ally. The president will unveil commitments from major corporations including Google, CoreWeave, and Blackstone. McCormick told attendees the stakes "couldn’t be higher", warning that if the US failed to lead in AI, it could cede control over infrastructure and technology to Beijing. "We will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party," he said. Amid soaring demand, Big Tech companies are racing to secure enough power to run energy-intensive data centres. Google announced a US$3 billion deal to acquire up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower from Brookfield Asset Management. The 20-year power purchase agreements will support electricity generation at two facilities in Pennsylvania. Cloud service provider CoreWeave also announced plans for a US$6 billion AI data centre, while asset manager Blackstone committed US$25 billion to building data centres and energy infrastructure across the state. Other executives in attendance include Mubadala CEO Khaldoon Al-Mubarak, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, Bechtel CEO Brendan Bechtel and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. The White House is weighing executive actions in the coming weeks to ease infrastructure development for AI. These include simplifying connections between energy projects and the grid, allocating federal land for data centres, and creating a nationwide Clean Water Act permit to streamline approval for AI infrastructure. Trump, who has declared AI a top national priority, ordered the creation of a comprehensive AI Action Plan in January. The plan, developed with input from the National Security Council, is due by Jul 23. He is expected to mark the occasion with a major speech titled "Winning the AI Race", organised by White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks and co-hosts from the All-In podcast. The surge in AI activity is pushing US electricity consumption to record highs. To meet demand, energy companies and tech firms are striking new deals, such as a proposed plan by Microsoft and Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. This growing demand has sparked concerns about power shortages, rising electricity bills, and potential blackouts that could disrupt the tech sector’s momentum in its race with global competitors like China.

Title: JPMorgan to test stablecoin services alongside proprietary deposit token in bid to speed settlements

Jamie Dimon framed the decision as defensive, as fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on a July 15 earnings call that the bank will launch products tied to stablecoins and its deposit coin as part of a broader payments strategy. As CNBC reported, Dimon said the firm “will be involved” in both formats to master the technology and protect market share. Dimon framed the decision as defensive. He said fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Furthermore, JPMorgan’s CEO added that the firm must engage rather than watch. Citigroup executives said during their call on the same day that the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” and sees immediate utility in tokenized deposits and digital‑asset custody. Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan has signaled similar intentions. Executives floated a joint effort through Early Warning Services, the consortium behind Zelle, although Dimon declined to confirm any collaboration plans, saying only that the bank weighs “all that.” Dimon’s remarks echo BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who told investors that the asset manager sees a “great untapped opportunity” in stablecoins for clients seeking digital access to Treasuries and other cash instruments. Fink cited the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill that aims to establish a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, adding that it could accelerate the adoption of stablecoins. Dimon remains critical of Bitcoin but views stablecoins as practical extensions of existing payment infrastructure. A retail‑facing stablecoin would broaden settlement options to a broader customer base and, once regulations permit, operate across multiple blockchains. Regulatory clarity motivates the shift. The House of Representatives plans a vote on the GENIUS Act later this week, and senators have signaled support for rules that slot stablecoin issuers under bank supervision. Furthermore, Dimon acknowledged that failing to act could allow non‑banks to capture cross‑border flows and merchant payments: “You know, these guys are very smart. They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that. And the way to be cognizant is to be involved.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Gardaí contacted over 950 times since school abuse appeal

Time Published: 2025-07-15T18:32:27Z

Barry Lenihan Gardaí have been contacted more than 950 times since their appeal last September relating to historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders. The updated figure came as the Dáil debated plans for a Commission of Investigation into historical abuse in schools, first announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee last Tuesday. David Ryan, who featured in the Blackrock Boys documentary which led to the Commission's ultimate announcement, was among those in the Dáil to witness the debate. Speaking on his way into Leinster House, Mr Ryan said he hoped survivors would get justice in the years ahead. He carried a framed picture of his late brother Mark - who featured in the same documentary - into the Houses of the Oireachtas with him. "It's a very momentous day for me. I wish Mark was with me as he would have been in his element to come in here. I thought this would never happen. It's sad and good at the same time, so I'm happy," Mr Ryan told RTÉ's Drivetime programme. "The last week has been a bit of rollercoaster since I heard what Minister McEntee was going to do. Other people can get their justice and they should be proud of themselves to come forward. It's frightening to find out how many people were abused in this country, it's just frightening," he said. Last September, a scoping inquiry found that there were 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse in relation to 308 schools recorded by the religious orders that ran the schools. The allegations were made about 884 distinct alleged abusers. The inquiry recommended last week's announcement of a Commission of Investigation. In a statement to RTÉ, An Garda Síochána said it had received over 950 contacts around historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders since the publication of the scoping inquiry. However, a spokesperson added how not all contacts could be acted upon. "An Garda Síochána (has) highlighted that while An Garda Síochána would endeavour to effectively deal with all contacts, there was likely to be limitations as to the action that could be taken in some cases due to matters such as unavailability of evidence over time or suspects and/or witnesses being deceased." Speaking in the Dáil, Ms McEntee reiterated plans to use all levers possible to ensure religious orders contribute to a planned redress scheme for survivors. She also commended those who have shared their stories to date and confirmed the Commission will commence work in the coming months. © RTÉ 2025.

European shares ended lower on Tuesday, dragged down by heavyweight financial and healthcare stocks as investors awaited news on a potential US-EU trade deal while assessing the latest US inflation data. DUBLIN The Iseq All-Share index ended the session narrowly in the black, up 0.06 per cent at 11,262.29, on Tuesday. Hotel group Dalata closed down 2.6 per cent to €6.37 after a Scandinavian consortium reached an agreement to buy the business for €1.4 billion. Permanent TSB was 1.91 per cent weaker on €2.05 after news broke early in the day that NatWest Group had sold its remaining 11.65 per cent shareholding in the bank, raising €126 million. Ryanair also fell, giving up 0.88 per cent to €23.57 on the day, alongside healthcare services group Uniphar which dropped 1.08 per cent, continuing losses from yesterday. Irish Ferries brand owner Irish Continental Group was the strongest performer on the index, closing up 1.44 per cent to €5.64. Gains by bankers kept the market in the green, with AIB rising 1.19 per cent and Bank of Ireland adding 1.25 per cent. LONDON The FTSE 100 retreated from record highs as rising US inflation raised concerns about the impact of tariffs. Investors also focused on the Bank of England’s monetary policy path. The blue-chip FTSE 100 dropped 0.7 per cent to 8,938.32, having crossed the 9,000 mark for the first time earlier in the day, while the domestically oriented FTSE 250 index fell 0.2 per cent. British stocks have largely shrugged off concerns about chaotic US trade policies, with the UK being the first country to secure a trade deal with the United States. Among individual stocks, GSK fell 1.5 per cent after the US Food and Drug Administration raised safety concerns that the drugmaker’s blood cancer drug Blenrep, when used in combination with other treatments, may cause eye damage in patients. Experian rose 4.3 per cent after the credit data firm reported 8 per cent organic revenue growth in its first quarter and reaffirmed its annual forecasts. Britain’s largest home builder Barratt Redrow slumped 8.9 per cent after it said home completions missed expectations for fiscal 2025. EUROPE The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.36 per cent. Several big European defence stocks were weaker after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose stiff economic penalties on Russia if it doesn’t end hostilities with Ukraine within 50 days. The threat came as he pledged fresh weapons supplies for Kyiv. Rheinmetall dropped 2.77 per cent and Dassault Aviation fell 2.47 per cent. In the euro zone, the banking index slipped 1.1 per cent.

Title: Coding has emerged as genAI’s killer use case. But what if its benefits are a mirage?

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Hello and welcome to Eye on AI…In this edition: Meta is going big on data centers…the EU publishes its code of practice for general purpose AI and OpenAI says it will abide by it…the U.K. AI Security Institute calls into question AI “scheming” research. The big news at the end of last week was that OpenAI’s plans to acquire Windsurf, a startup that was making AI software for coding, for $3 billion fell apart. (My Fortune colleague Allie Garfinkle broke that bit of news.) Instead, Google announced that it was hiring Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan and cofounder Douglas Chen and a clutch of other Windsurf staffers, while also licensing Windsurf’s tech—a deal structured similarly to several other big tech-AI startup not-quite-acquihire acquihires, including Meta’s recent deal with Scale AI, Google’s deal with Character.ai last year, as well as Microsoft’s deal with Inflection and Amazon’s with Adept. Bloomberg reported that Google is paying about $2.4 billion for Windsurf’s talent and tech, while another AI startup, Cognition, swooped in to buy what was left of Windsurf for an undisclosed sum. Windsurf may have gotten less than OpenAI was offering, but OpenAI’s purchase reportedly fell apart after OpenAI and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether Microsoft would have access to Windsurf’s tech.The increasingly fraught relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft is worth a whole separate story. So too is the structure of these non-acquisition acquihires—which really do seem to blunt any legal challenges, either from regulators or the venture backers of the startups. But today, I want to talk about coding assistants. While a lot of people debate the return on investment from generative AI, the one thing seemingly everyone can agree on is that coding is the one clear killer use case for genAI. Right? I mean, that’s why Windsurf was such a hot property and why Anyshphere, the startup behind the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at close to $10 billion. And GitHub Copilot is of course the star of Microsoft’s suite of AI tools, with a majority of customers saying they get value out of the product. Well, a trio of papers published this past week complicate this picture. METR, a nonprofit that benchmarks AI models, conducted a randomized control trial involving 16 developers earlier this year to see if using code editor Cursor Pro integrated with Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 models, actually improved their productivity. METR surveyed the developers before the trial to see if they thought it would make them more efficient and by how much. On average, they estimated that using AI would allow them to complete the assigned coding tasks 24% faster. Then the researchers randomized 246 software coding tasks, either allowing them to be completed with AI or not. Afterwards, the developers were surveyed again on what impact they thought the use of Cursor had actually had on the average time to complete the tasks. They estimated that it made them on average 20% faster. (So maybe not quite as efficient as they had forecast, but still pretty good.) But, and now here’s the rub, METR found that when assisted by AI it actually took the coders 19% longer to finish tasks.What’s going on here? Well, one issue was that the developers, who were all highly experienced, found that Cursor could not reliably generate code as good as theirs. In fact, they accepted less than 44% of the code-generated responses. And when they did accept them, three-quarters of the developers felt the need to still read over every line of AI-generated code to check it for accuracy, and more than half of the coders made major changes to the Cursor-written code to clean it up. This all took time—on average 9% of the developers time was spent reviewing and cleaning up AI-generated outputs. Many of the tasks in the METR experiment involved large code bases, sometimes consisting of over 100,000 lines of code, and the developers found that sometimes Cursor made strange changes in other parts of this code base that they had to catch and fix. But why did the developers think the AI was making them faster when in fact it was slowing them down? And why, when the researchers followed up with the developers after the experiment ended, did they discover that 69% of the coders were continuing to use Cursor?Some of it seems to be that despite the time it took to edit the Cursor-generated code, the AI assistance did actually ease the cognitive burden for many of the coders. It was mentally easier to fix the AI-generated code than to have to puzzle out the right solution from scratch. So is the perceived ROI from “vibe coding” itself just vibes? Perhaps. That would actually square with what the Wall Street Journal noted about a different area of genAI use—lawyers using genAI copilots. The newspaper reported that a number of law firms found that given how long it took to fact-check AI-generated legal research, they were not sure lawyers were actually saving any time using the tools. But when they surveyed lawyers, especially junior lawyers, they all reported high satisfaction using the AI copilots and that they felt it made their jobs more enjoyable.But a couple of other studies from last week suggest that maybe it all depends on exactly how you use AI coding assistance. A team from Harvard Business School and Microsoft looked at two years of observations of software developers using GitHub Copilot (which is Microsoft product) and found that those using the tool spent more time on coding and less time on project management tasks, in part because GitHub Copilot allowed them to work independently instead of having to use large teams. It also allowed the coders to spend more time exploring possible solutions to coding problems and less time actually implementing the solutions. This too might explain why coders enjoy using these AI tools—because it allows them to spend more time on parts of the job they find intellectually interesting— even if it isn’t necessarily about overall time-savings. Finally, let’s look at the third study, which is from researchers at Chinese AI startup Modelbest, Chinese universities BUPT and Tsinghua University, and the University of Sydney. They found that while individual AI software development tools often struggled to reliably complete complicated tasks, the results improved markedly when multiple large language models were prompted to each take on a specific role in the software development process and to pose clarifying questions to one another aimed at minimizing hallucinations. They called this architecture “ChatDev.” So maybe there’s a case to be made that the problem with AI coding assistants is how we are using them, not anything wrong with the tech itself? Of course, building teams of AI agents to work in the way ChatDev suggests also uses up a lot more computing power, which gets expensive. So maybe we’re still facing that question: is the ROI here a mirage? With that, here’s more AI news.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the Trump administration is set to reverse course and ease export restrictions on the company’s H20 AI chip, with deliveries to resume soon. Nvidia also introduced a new AI chip for the Chinese market that complies with current U.S. rules, as Huang visits Beijing in a diplomatic push to reassure customers and engage officials. While China is encouraging buyers to adopt local alternatives, companies like ByteDance and Alibaba continue to prefer Nvidia’s offerings due to their superior performance and software ecosystem. Nvidia’s stock and that of TSMC, which makes the chips for Nvidia, jumped sharply on the news. Read more from the Financial Times here. Zuckerberg confirms Meta will spend hundreds of billions in data center push. In a Threads post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company is spending “hundreds of billions of dollars” to build massive AI-focused data centers, including one called Prometheus set to launch in 2026. The data centers are part of a broader push toward developing artificial general intelligence or “superintelligence.” Read more from Bloomberg here. OpenAI and Mistral say they will sign EU code of practice for general-purpose AI. The EU published its code of practice last week for general-purpose AI systems under the EU AI Act, about two months later than initially expected. Adhering to the code, which is voluntary, gives companies assurance that they are in compliance with the Act. The code imposes a stringent set of public and government reporting requirements on frontier AI model developers, requiring them to provide a wealth of information about their models’ design and testing to the EU’s new AI Office. It also requires public transparency around the use of copyrighted materials in the training of AI systems. You can read more about the code of practice from Politico here. Many had expected the big technology vendors and AI companies to form a united front in opposing the code—Meta and Google had previously attacked drafts of it, claiming it imposed too great a burden on tech firms—but OpenAI said in a blog post Friday that it would sign up to the standards. Mistral, the French AI model developer, also said it would sign—although it had previously asked the EU to delay enforcement of the AI Act, whose provisions on general-purpose AI are set to come into force on August 2nd. That may up the pressure on other AI companies to agree to comply too. Report: AWS is testing a new cloud service to make it easier to use third-party AI models. That’s according to a story in The Information, which says Amazon cloud service AWS is making the move after losing business from several AI startups to Google Cloud. Some customers complained it was too difficult to tap models from OpenAI and Google, which are hosted on other clouds, from within AWS. Amazon mulls further multi-billion dollar investment in Anthropic. That’s according to a story in the Financial Times. Amazon has already invested $8 billion in Anthropic and the two companies have formed an ever-closer alliance, with Anthropic working with Amazon on several massive new data centers and helping it develop its next generation Trainium2 AI chips. Could all those studies about scheming AI be faulty? That’s the suggestion of a new paper out from a group of researchers at the U.K. government’s AI Security Institute. The paper, called “Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language” examines recent claims that advanced AI models engage in deceptive or manipulative behavior—what AI Safety researchers call “scheming.” Drawing an analogy to 1970s research about whether non-human primates were capable of using language—which ultimately were found to have overstated the depth of linguistic capacity that chimpanzees possess—the authors argue that the AI scheming literature suffers from similar flaws. Specifically, the researchers say the AI scheming research suffers from an over-interpretation of anecdotal behavior, a lack of theoretical clarity, an absence of rigorous controls, and a reliance on anthropomorphic language. They caution that current studies often confuse AI systems following human-provided instructions with intentional deception and may exaggerate the implications of observed behaviors. While acknowledging that scheming could pose future risks, the authors call for more scientifically robust methodologies before drawing strong conclusions. They offer concrete recommendations, including clearer hypotheses, better experimental controls, and more cautious interpretation of AI behavior. The world’s best AI models operate in English.

AI is not going to save the news media. I’ve been thinking a lot about AI’s impact on the news media lately both because it happens to be the industry I’m in and also because Fortune has recently started experimenting more with using AI to produce some of our basic news stories. (I use AI a bit to produce the short news blurbs for this newsletter too, although I don’t use it to write the main essay.) Well, Jason Koebler, a cofounder of tech publication 404 Media, has an interesting essay out this week on why he thinks many media organizations are being misguided in their efforts to use AI to produce news more efficiently.He argues that the media’s so-called “pivot to AI” is a mirage—a desperate, misguided attempt by executives to appear forward-thinking while ignoring the structural damage AI is already inflicting on their businesses. He argues that many news execs are imposing AI on newsrooms with no clear business strategy beyond vague promises of innovation. He says this approach won't work: relying on the same tech that's gutting journalism to save it is both delusional and self-defeating. Instead, he argues, the only viable path forward is to double down on what AI can’t replicate: trustworthy, personality-driven, human journalism that resonates with audiences. AI may offer productivity boosts at the margins—transcripts, translations, editing tools—but these don't add up to a sustainable model. You can read his essay here. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Elon Musk's North Star is becoming increasingly clear

Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:42:17Z
Full Content:
AI has increasingly become the connective tissue of Musk Inc. In the last week, Elon Musk has shed light on two potential efforts to channel funding into his AI company, xAI, through his broader business empire. Over the weekend, Musk said Tesla shareholders would vote on a potential investment in xAI, after responding to a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX is looking into investing $2 billion into the AI venture. Earlier in the week, the billionaire also announced that xAI's chatbot Grok would be integrated into Tesla "next week at the latest." It's no surprise that Musk is leaning into AI — the CEO has spoken about the idea in many of Tesla's earnings calls over the last year. What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he's blending the boundaries between his companies. "What's different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla)," Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. "Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella." These aren't the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they're the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla's focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, "We should be thought of as an AI robotics company," and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding "the wrong framework." With the recent launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla's auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the "Muskonomy," pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize "longtime shareholders" of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Nelson told BI that Musk leveraging his other companies and resources could help Tesla meet its AI demands for autonomous driving. "Tesla's data needs are massive if its approach to autonomous driving is going to be successful (and scalable), as its approach will require the development of a global neural network," Nelson said. While exploring ways to pool resources across companies might benefit the broader Musk ecosystem, it could carry risk. Last week, Grok sparked backlash with antisemitic outbursts on X, potentially putting investors on edge about integrating the chatbot into Tesla's EVs. xAI apologized for the incidents and said that new instructions to prioritize engagement could have reflected "extremist views" from user posts on X. Last year, Musk also sparked concern among investors when he diverted a $500 million shipment of Nvidia chips intended for Tesla to X and xAI instead. When asked about the move in a Tesla earnings call, he said it was beneficial to Tesla because the carmaker lacked the infrastructure at the time to use the chips. Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company to Business Insider, said that Musk may be leaning on SpaceX and Tesla to fund xAI because he views them as more "mature businesses." However, he said that shifting GPUs from Tesla to xAI in the past showed where Musk's priorities were, and that could delay innovation at the automaker. "The strategy of cannibalizing one business to prop up another one could take its toll," Sevilla said. "Especially since competing carmakers are focused on developing one type of product, EVs." Musk seems to be ruling out the idea of a merger between Tesla and his AI startup for now. In response to an X user asking Tesla shareholders to weigh in on whether Tesla and xAI should be combined, Musk replied with a flat "No." Investing in AI efforts might make sense from a strategy perspective, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The development, training, and implementation of foundational AI systems, like xAI's Grok 4, costs many, many billions. In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, valuing the AI startup between $33 billion and $80 billion. Since founding the company two years ago, he's raised major funding, including around $12 billion in Series A, B, and C funding rounds last year. The company is expected to spend about $13 billion this year, however, and is rapidly burning through its cash reserves, Bloomberg reported. Musk's challenges keeping up with AI costs aren't unique. In a May letter to California's attorney general, OpenAI revealed concerns about competitors who are "far better funded, conventional for-profit businesses." Larger tech giants, like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, aren't showing any signs of backing down from their AI spending spree. Earnings reports from earlier this year indicate that their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025, a notable rise from the roughly $246 billion the four companies spent in 2024. Amazon plans to allocate over $100 billion this year toward expanding AWS and scaling AI infrastructure. Meta specifically has said it plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capex on its strategy this year. Zuckerberg certainly isn't slowing down. On Monday, he announced Meta would spend "hundreds of billions" on compute to build superintelligence. Wall Street seemed to approve, with Meta's stock rising 1.3% following the news, suggesting that its concern isn't about overspending on the AI race — but rather underspending and falling behind.

Title: How Texas Bullied Big Banks Into Dropping Their Climate Commitments

By Lauren Windsor Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America’s biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event. Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor’s mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank’s execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance. When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank’s executives they were this close “to being sued right now.” After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. Paxton’s office did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment. In a statement, Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street’s financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton’s office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Consumers’ Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives’ “war on woke.” Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn’t stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action. Related Content Jordan Klepper Charts Trump’s Long History With Jeffrey Epstein on ‘The Daily Show’ Why the Trump Administration Is About to Set Fire to 500 Tons of Emergency Food Speaker Mike Johnson Splits From Trump, Calls for Release of Epstein Files What Trump Has Said About Jeffrey Epstein Over the Years Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.” As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. Texas, for instance, passed the nation’s first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters. “At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers’ Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas’ antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We’re not recording this, right? … Please don’t quote me, because I’m telling the inside story on this.” He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits. “They’re all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.” Leo’s network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement’s culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo’s dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives. According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo’s Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers’ Research. CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo’s network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo’s organizations have long operated. Consumers’ Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo’s agenda. Since 2020, Consumers’ Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street. Some of the anti-ESG coalition’s biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers’ Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC’s largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers’ Research’s director, said that Consumers’ Research was the largest donor to SFOF. For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer. ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency. Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests. At one point at the Consumers’ Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.” Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems’ finances. “The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I’m sure, I’m glad I’m not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said. He argued that’s why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

Title: Woman (80) awarded €60,000 after social life impacted by trip on footpath
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/15/woman-80-awarded-60000-after-social-life-impacted-by-trip-on-footpath/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:08:13Z
Full Content:
An 80-year-old woman has been awarded just short of €60,000 damages by a judge who said her social life had been greatly impacted by injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell on a hazardous footpath. Judge Terence O’Sullivan said Anita Bryan, a keen golfer, of Somerton, Rochestown Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, had suffered bad injuries to her left wrist and right knee, causing her to abandon golf at her club, Woodenbridge in Arklow, Co Wicklow. “I haven’t played golf for five years because I am unable to walk for the four hours plus that it would take to complete a round,” Ms Bryan told the Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday. Barrister Damian Sheridan, who appeared with Murphy McElligott Solicitors for Ms Bryan, told the court she had tripped on the raised edge of a pavement slab outside Cavistons Food Emporium on the Glasthule Road, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on the day before Christmas Eve, 2019. Ms Bryan said she had been walking arm-in-arm with her husband when her shoe caught on the slab, catapulting her forward. She had fallen and broken her left wrist and suffered a displaced fracture of the right patella of her right knee. “The pain was dreadful and my wrist and leg were put in casts at the hospital. I was in a wheelchair for six weeks,” she told the judge. Ms Bryan said she had received eight cortisone injections and was awaiting more for her knee injury. “I cannot kneel properly any more and one of my favourite hobbies, apart from golf, was gardening,” she said. She sued Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Cavistons Food Emporium, which the local authority let out of the proceeding without blame. The judge told barrister Kevin Callan, counsel for Northstone Construction, Blackrock, Co Dublin, that his client was not liable for the incident. Forensic engineer Alan Conlan said he had examined the footpath shortly after the incident and found one of the slabs loose and rocking. The edge of the slab was raised above the level of other pavement slabs that had later been repaired. “The loose slab was a potential trip hazard,” he said. Awarding Ms Bryan €59,250, barely short of the €60,000 maximum jurisdiction of the court, against the local authority, Judge O’Sullivan said she had suffered bad injuries and had not overstated her claim in any way. “I feel that on the balance of probability that works to the footpath had to have been carried out by the local authority and nobody else,” the judge said. “Ms Bryan was a truthful witness and her life has been severely impacted by the accident. There is no question of contributory negligence.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

July 15, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum’s role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. Based on reports, this week’s Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar’s global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,’ designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” First call: Bullish ETH pic.twitter.com/sERRZiTgMq — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 14, 2025 Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn’t just for the token itself. It’s a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum’s code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale. It isn’t all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum’s lead. Still, the network’s mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: WATCH LIVE: Trump plugs energy agenda at Pennsylvania innovation summit

Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Leave your feedback PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump touted tens of billions of dollars of recent energy and technology investments Tuesday in Pennsylvania while boasting of a “true golden age for America” in energy policy and artificial intelligence. Trump traveled to Pittsburgh at a summit helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick that included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit. Watch Trump’s remarks live in our video player above. “I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.” Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence, with Trump saying, “We are way ahead of China, I have to say.” “China and other countries are racing to catch up to America on AI, and we’re not going to let them do it,” Trump said during the hourlong roundtable held in a university gymnasium, speaking often from prepared notes. Flanked by several of his Cabinet members, company executives and local political leaders, Trump added that the U.S. will be “fighting them in a very friendly fashion.” WATCH: Trump rolled back energy tax credits for homeowners and developers. Here’s what that means for you Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.

Here are some ways to lower your electric bill Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant, and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in south-central Pennsylvania. Blackstone plans to spend $25 billion on data centers and building new natural gas-fired power plants in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the company will start construction by the end of 2028, said Jon Gray, its CEO. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. “What’s exciting about this event is it’s a great catalyst for investments and closing deals in the region,” said Jake Loosararian, the founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called AI Avenue that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars, and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. READ MORE: Nippon Steel finalizes $15 billion buyout of U.S. Steel after sealing national security agreement Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Constellation Energy is reopening the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for Microsoft’s data centers.

Title: 5 stats that show where BlackRock is — and where the world's largest asset manager is going
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-earnings-call-key-stats-showing-trajectory-larry-fink-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:58:57Z
Full Content:
There are lots of big numbers that come up on BlackRock earnings calls. It's what happens when you're the largest asset manager in the world. The key thing for investors in the firm and competitors tracking the behemoth from afar is deciphering which of the gaudy current-day figures will keep growing and which of the optimistic projections will actually happen. BlackRock already manages $12.5 trillion in assets across institutions, insurers, pensions, and wealthy people, mostly in public markets. It's spent the last year and a half acquiring businesses that would help it move more of that money into lucrative private markets, where fees are higher and capital is stickier. At its investor day last month, the firm laid out its goal to hit $35 billion in annual revenue in 2030, an increase from $20 billion in 2024. Business Insider highlighted five stats from the firm's Tuesday call with analysts to demonstrate asset manager is currently and where it hopes to be in five years. The net inflows into BlackRock products in the first half. The influx of assets was led by a record six months from the firm's iShares ETF line, which brought in a net $192 billion of new money. BlackRock's existing business, particularly its low-fee index investing funds, is the biggest pile of money in the industry and is still growing consistently. Still, the first half of the year was not perfect, as some of the firm's actively traded products experienced a performance dip. The decline in performance fees collected by BlackRock in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Rocky equity and bond markets worldwide, caused primarily by the trade policies proposed by President Donald Trump, have been challenging for investors of all sizes to deal with. At BlackRock, the firm's profit margin dipped to 43.3% this quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's second quarter, and CFO Martin Small attributed 75% of that drop to the decline in performance fees. Active equity funds in particular have had a rough 12-month stretch, the firm's earnings supplement shows: Only 40% of assets are above the index or peer median. The firm also noted that private market funds brought in fewer performance fees than last year, but the firm's ambitions for that space remain as large as ever. The amount of revenue HPS Investment Partners is expected to add to BlackRock's coffers in the third quarter, according to Small. The deal for the $165 billion private credit shop closed at the start of July, and Small said the firm will issue the equivalent of up to 13.8 million shares of BlackRock common stock to retain the team at the firm. The retention of HPS's team will be critical for BlackRock, which wants to fundraise significantly for its private-credit and infrastructure offerings over the next five years. The fundraising goal for private market fundraising through 2030. Small said he expects it to ramp up in 2028 as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners, the firm's other large private market investor acquisition, become more ingrained in the firm. CEO Larry Fink said that he was in Asia last week, where demand for infrastructure and other private-public partnerships is already "beyond our imagination." Those partnerships — the firm has pulled in Singapore's Temasek in its artificial intelligence infrastructure push — will be needed if the manager hopes to hit its revenue goals. The proportion of the firm's revenue that it wants to derive from its private markets funds and tech services platform, led by Aladdin, by 2030. The New York-based firm made nearly $10.7 billion in revenue in 2025's first half, driven by its equity ETFs, which hauled in $2.8 billion in revenue alone. Tech services, meanwhile, made roughly a third of that in the same time frame. BlackRock's Aladdin platform already serves more than 200 institutional clients, effectively making the firm an infrastructure provider to many of its clients and some of its competitors. But the firm's fundraising push for its private market offerings also includes the hope that individual retirement accounts in the US will soon be open to such options. Fink and Small both said that litigation reform is needed before that could happen, but are optimistic about what they've heard out of Washington on the subject. "We think we have all the building blocks here," Small said. Correction July 15, 2025: An earlier version of this story misstated BlackRock's revenue target for its private markets and technology businesses by 2030. The goal is for these segments to account for 30% of the firm's revenue, not 40%. Jump to

Title: Nvidia stock jumps after the AI titan says it can sell some of its top chips to China again
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-china-h20-chip-ai-capex-gpus-2025
Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:46:06Z

The move: Nvidia stock jumped as much as 5% on Tuesday morning, rising to $172.39 a share. After bottoming in April, the stock has regained momentum and is currently up more than 27% year-to-date. The chart: Why: The company said that the US government will clear it to start shipping its H20 chips to China again. In a July 14 blog post, Nvidia announced that it had begun filing applications to resume selling the H20 GPU in China. "The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon," it added. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently met with policymakers in both the US and China, including President Donald Trump, to discuss the importance of supporting artificial intelligence infrastructure. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said in an interview on Tuesday morning that multiple Chinese firms are currently at work on similar chips, which could pose a threat to America's AI dominance. This decision is a stark contrast from the Trump administration's previous position on Chinese trade relations. In April 2025, NVDA stock fell as the White House announced strict controls on selling AI-enabling chips to China. What it means: Morgan Stanley CIO and chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson said he sees the development as a highly bullish indicator for the broader AI sector. He said that the AI capital expenditure (capex) cycle has been significant for the market's recovery, although it often doesn't receive much attention. "This deal is just more fuel to that fire," he said. Wilson also noted that the new Chinese revenue would be a "huge, positive kick to margins" for Nvidia. Reports indicate that Chinese firms are already rushing to buy the Nvidia chip when H20 sales resume. Jump to

AMD stock soars 8% after unveiling its powerful MI350 AI chips, signaling a bold challenge to Nvidia’s dominance in AI hardware. Backed by HSBC’s upgrade and a price target boost to $200, AMD is finally stepping out of Nvidia’s shadow. With its next-gen MI400 series expected in 2026, AMD is gaining momentum in the AI arms race. Investors are now watching closely as the company earns new credibility in high-performance AI chips. As AMD chips line up for enterprise adoption from tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI, the stock’s breakout hints at a potential power shift in AI.

Title: Solana RWAs surge 217% hitting $553 million in real world assets as memecoins lose focus
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/solana-rwas-surge-217-to-hit-553-million-in-real-world-assets-as-memecoins-lose-focus/

Solana's RWA ecosystem grows over 600% in user adoption, solidifying its position as a high-performance blockchain challenger. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA) market surpassed $550 million and rocketed up 217% year-to-date in 2025. The explosive growth, more than double the pace of the broader market, positions the high-speed blockchain as a serious challenger to Ethereum’s long-held dominance in one of crypto’s most promising sectors. As of press time, Solana has reached $558 million to take third place behind ZKsync Era and Ethereum per rwa.xyz. The numbers behind Solana’s recent ascent in the RWA space are impressive. While the overall market for tokenized assets grew by a respectable 61% this year, Solana’s ecosystem expanded at more than three times that rate. This momentum is fueled by both institutional-grade protocols and a groundswell of retail interest. Key protocols like Ondo Finance and ONe’s institutional fund are leading the charge, collectively accounting for approximately $276 million, or around half of Solana’s non-stablecoin RWA value. However, the most dramatic growth metric comes from user adoption. In a recent 30-day period, the number of unique wallets holding tokenized stocks on Solana surged by an astonishing 684%, jumping from just 7,400 to over 58,000. This rapid adoption is a direct result of Solana’s core architecture. The network’s reputation for high throughput and near-zero transaction costs, famously battle-tested during the memecoin frenzies of late 2024, has created a hyper-efficient environment. What was once seen as a “degen” playground has proven its capacity to handle massive transaction volumes, over 200 million daily at its peak, with over 16 months of uninterrupted uptime. This proven performance is now attracting serious RWA projects that require speed and low fees to manage the complex lifecycle of a tokenized asset. To understand the significance of Solana’s rise, it must be viewed against the industry’s giants. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of RWAs, commanding a 58.4% market share with a colossal $7.7 billion in tokenized value. ZKsync Era is next in line with $2.2 billion and a 17% market share. Yet, a clear divergence in momentum is emerging. In the last 30 days, Ethereum’s and second-place ZKsync Era’s RWA value grew by a sluggish 3.6% and 0.9%, respectively, while Solana’s jumped by 22.3% to reach 4.2% market share and overtake Aptos. The ultimate institutional litmus test is BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the largest tokenized Treasury fund with approximately $2.8 billion in assets under management. While the vast majority of BUIDL resides on Ethereum, BlackRock’s strategic decision to expand the fund onto Solana is a powerful vote of confidence. This move, which has already brought over $25.2 million of BUIDL to the network, validates Solana’s infrastructure. It also signals a sophisticated multi-chain strategy from major institutions, which are beginning to use high-performance chains like Solana as efficient “distribution outposts” for trading and utilizing assets that are custodied on Ethereum. Beyond the headline applications, Solana’s long-term RWA strategy is being solidified by crucial, foundational infrastructure development, the “picks and shovels” needed to build a trillion-dollar market. A landmark integration with enterprise blockchain R3 Corda is a key example. According to Messari, this partnership allows institutions using R3’s trusted, private ledger to tap into the Solana public blockchain for final settlement. It’s a “best of both worlds” approach that bridges private enterprise assets with the liquidity and efficiency of a public chain, positioning Solana as a potential universal settlement layer. Furthermore, a new partnership between the public company DeFi Dev Corp. and oracle provider Switchboard aims to build RWA-specific oracles on Solana. As Messari Research Analyst Matthew Nay notes, “Solana’s appeal stems from its high throughput, near-zero transaction costs, and robust developer ecosystem.” However, for institutions to trust on-chain assets, they need reliable, verifiable data feeds that connect to off-chain value. This focus on building a robust data infrastructure is a critical step toward winning institutional trust and unlocking the next wave of tokenization. The institutional RWA narrative and Solana’s retail-tested performance have created a potent combination. Solana is rapidly transitioning from a network known for its speculative hype cycles into a serious contender for the future of finance. While significant hurdles remain, including historical concerns about network stability and the unresolved legal challenges facing the entire RWA sector, the momentum is undeniable. With its technical advantages, explosive growth, and a growing seal of approval from a giant like BlackRock, Solana has become a key protagonist in the story of how trillions in traditional assets will ultimately move on-chain.

CoreWeave (CRWV) shares extended gains this week after the Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it would invest more than $6 billion in a new AI data center in Pennsylvania. The AI cloud provider’s stock jumped over 8% to above $143 in early trading Tuesday, building on a 5% gain a day earlier. Shares have more than tripled since CoreWeave went public in March but are down about 14% from last week, when the company announced a $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific. CoreWeave plans to announce the data center investment as part of a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump and other lawmakers and industry leaders at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit. “The demand for high-performance AI compute is relentless, and CoreWeave is scaling a cloud purpose-built for AI to meet it and strengthen US leadership,” CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said. “This data center will accelerate innovation and drive economic growth across the region.”

Title: Bernstein Analyst Declares NVIDIA H20 Ban Was “Unnecessary And, Frankly, Somewhat Nonsensical,” Another Analyst Sees Broader Strokes Of A Rare Earths Deal

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. It appears that the US has eased some of its heretofore stringent restrictions on China's access to advanced silicon chips, unlocking a huge windfall for NVIDIA and AMD in the process, with a Citi analyst now theorizing that the reprieve could have been part of a broader rare earth magnets deal with China. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, NVIDIA published a blog post earlier today, announcing the imminent filing of an application with the US government to resume the sale of its China-specific H20 GPUs. As we noted in our post on this topic, NVIDIA now claims that it has received assurances from US officials that it will receive the requisite authorization promptly. As such, the company hopes to commence deliveries of the H20 GPUs to China "soon." Meanwhile, AMD has also announced its intention to seek the requisite US approvals to resume the shipments of its China-specific MI308 GPUs This brings us to the crux of the matter. While commenting on this major breakthrough, a Bernstein analyst has noted that NVIDIA lost around $4.5 billion in its April-ending quarter from inventory write-offs and the associated purchase commitments after the Trump administration communicated to the chipmaker on the 09th of April that its H20 GPUs were to be subjected to an "indefinite" export licensing requirement. What's more, these licensing requirements also cost NVIDIA around $8 billion in potential revenue during the ongoing quarter. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has previously stated that its annual revenue opportunity in China stood at $50 billion. While Bernstein is uncertain whether all customers behind NVIDIA's pre-ban quarterly revenue run-rate in China would receive the requisite US authorizations, the firm calculates that "every ~$10B of recovered NVDA China revenues would drive roughly 25 cents in additional EPS." The Bernstein analyst concludes: "We always saw the H20 ban as unnecessary and, frankly, somewhat nonsensical." Meanwhile, Citi has theorized that the broader strokes of a rare earth magnets deal with China might have prompted this major breakthrough: "While US/China has patched up recently post EDA ban removal and a rare earth magnets deal, we believe this reversal could be part of the deal too."

Learn to navigate the tech career ladder and empower others. Bruno Rey is a Staff Engineer at Eventbrite. With over 15yrs of experience in software development, he's worked at companies large and small with broad experience in different positions such as QA, Sales and Solutions Architect. Outside of work he's a century cyclist, musician, audiophile hobbyist and a father of two. Software is changing the world. QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Rey: I started coding in 1999. I was 12 years old at the time. That was the first programming book that I read cover to cover. That was my first programming language (Visual Basic). It's not very popular today, but today I have no shame in saying it. I've been working professionally in tech for 17 years, working since I had my first full-time job at a serious company. It took me 15 years to become a staff engineer, which is my current role at Eventbrite. You might think 15 years to become a staff engineer is a long time, and you're right, that's a problem. That's hopefully what will not happen to you if you listen to this talk, and how you can help others grow faster as well. This talk is for those who want to grow in their career, who want to climb that ladder, but it's also for those who want to help others grow. We're going to discuss growth, basically. We're going to discuss the ladder. I expect most of the people to be on the second part, but there might also be some on the first part. Again, the topics are the same, so there's really no difference. I thought a lot about what drives growth. I also did a lot of research. I also talked to a lot of people preparing for this talk. What I came up with in order is that, the first factor, and probably the most important one, is ambition. It's really hard to grow in your career if you don't have that ambition. In second place, I find that capacity is important. Being able to perform, being able to learn new things, all of that. In third place, you might be very good at both. You might be excellent at your job, but you need an external factor. You need that opportunity. There's nowhere for you to grow. It's really hard to do that. The reason why I put ambition first instead of capacity or curiosity, or whatever, becomes really clear when you think about the definition of ambition. The one I like from the Oxford Dictionary says that ambition is a strong desire to achieve something, typically requiring determination, effort, and drive. If you read between the lines, what this is telling you is that a person with ambition will be able to develop that capacity as needed. They will do that through determination, effort, and drive. They will learn whatever they need to learn. I want you to put yourselves, for a moment, in the shoes of a person who's very early on their career, just starting, just accepting their new job. Probably the company offered them a position and told them, "Yes, this company is growing. You're going to grow really fast. It's going to be great for you". Things don't always go that way. Sometimes we find that the first years of our career look more like this. This is very typical. It's not terrible, but if you want to accelerate growth, you should try to avoid this. You should start by identifying the problems. What is causing this type of growth in your career that's not really fast because it's not really directed? Typically, it's one of two things. It's either a lack of focus on execution or a lack of direction. When we go to high school and college, they tell us that we should strive for perfection. You want to have that perfect grade. You want to have that perfect opinion from your teachers about your work. As soon as you get into business, you need to completely change your mindset. Perfection is the killer of execution. This is very well put in the Amazon Leadership Principles as bias for action. That's one that I really like. In the early years of someone's career, it's very important to help them make this shift of mind, make this shift of paradigm, and to start focusing on execution over perfection, without dropping quality, of course. Secondly, if someone is having trouble finding their direction, there are ways to help them. The best thing is for them to do research first on their own. Then, the second turn, to seek for mentoring. When I talk about research, you can read a book and you can read a blog, that's good. You should also do your own research. If you think, I want to be a staff engineer in five years, or I want to be a manager, you should look probably within your company and ask yourself, what does a manager's life look like? What does a staff engineer do? How do these people work? How did they get there? Is that really what I want for my life? That's the type of research that will bring things a bit more down to earth and make them more achievable. You should also look at blogs and books to get the theory behind that. Again, when someone is coming out of college, seeing things in the real world makes a real difference. It's important to do that part as well. Again, put yourself in the shoes of someone who's early in their career and they're having trouble growing. Typically, they ask themselves, why are we not growing? What's happening? Many people will come up with these answers. The market is terrible right now. I miss the golden era. We all did. There's always some nostalgia to some golden era that never existed, really. That doesn't matter. This can be real, but they can also be seen as just excuses. There are also people who will come up with these types of responses, "I haven't been directing my efforts efficiently, or, I have poor time management skills". If you look at it, these ones on the right hint much more introspection and sound much more personal. The ones that I put here are real life examples from people close to me, from people I've mentored, and even some of my own. This is a very popular framework. Some of you might have recognized it already. This is known as the victim-player framework. Essentially, what it says is that what you cannot control makes you weak, but what you can control makes you powerful. We have the idea, mostly when we're young, to think about showing weaknesses is what makes me weak. In real life, it's quite the opposite, showing your weaknesses is what makes you strong. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the victim-player framework. I'm going to give the quintessential example of it, which is how two different people might react to a traffic jam. One employee can say, "It's a very big problem. It was totally unpredictable. There is nothing I can do now. I'm just stuck here". An ideal employee would probably call their boss and tell them, "Boss, I'm sorry. I had a big problem today. I'm at a traffic jam. I'm going to have to take the first call from my car. I hope that's not a problem. I can stay up and make some extra time today if necessary. Also, I've realized that this is a recurring pattern, and I've already made a decision to start taking the train instead, because it's becoming unacceptable". This is someone taking ownership of that situation. Of course, this is a very typical example, but in real life, you know how it goes. This is also very similar to other concepts. They're all the same thing. It's also called being proactive or taking agency, not being the victim. It's the same thing. It changes over time. The concepts are slightly different, but they're all aimed at taking control of what you can, essentially. I mentioned I included a couple of my own here. Today, I have no shame in saying that. I'm not ashamed of my first programming language, which you already know. I started working when I was 20. Early on in my career, I noticed that I was having issues with my work. Mostly, it was very hard for me to have a meeting with people outside of my company because my social anxiety was terrible. It's really hard for me to speak publicly here today. Also, I couldn't execute anything over a long period of time. Obviously, I was job hopping a lot, which is sometimes normal in the early stage of your career. When I was 23, I was doing a lot of introspection, and I had the good luck of having a great manager at the time who provided me with a safe place where I could feel confident talking to him. It took me a lot of time. I didn't have the tools at the time to identify this. It took me three years. When I did, I came up to him one day and told him, "I think my depression is setting me back". He told me, "Yes". However, his response was great. After that, we came up with a plan together. He spent months working with me in order for me to get better. I'm better today. He continued to make sure that I felt safe at work and that there wouldn't be any retaliation or anything. He took care of the projects. He paired me with some other people and everything. He was a great guy, Gustavo. Shortly after this, there was a meeting at a bar with work colleagues. Someone else got a promotion. Of course, I didn't because I was doing terrible. This was back in the day when we worked at offices and we had to wear suits and everything. This was a very traditional company. This person had bought a new suit and came to the bar. Someone told him, you look great. Someone else said, a man who takes care of himself is a man who can take care of others. That phrase at that time really resonated with me because that's when it hit me, like, how am I expected to lead a team if I cannot put my own life back together? I talked about that a lot with my boss at the time. I got my shit together, basically. That started working better. If you think about my manager's reaction at the time and why he helped me, it wasn't just because he's a great guy, which he is. It was also in the best interest of the company. When people don't grow, many people will blame their company for their bad career path. They will say, the company is holding me back and things like that. Truth is, companies usually don't do that. It's very rare for a company to do that. It's in the best interest of a company for their employees to do well, to thrive. They will help you. Companies don't want to deal with low-performing employees. Companies don't want to put you on a performance improvement plan or anything like that. It's very expensive for the company to do that. It's more profitable to have employees who are doing well. Managers are expected to help them do well in order to achieve that, in order to have a well-functioning team that starts providing value, at a good pace. Once I made that click, that's when my career really took off. That's when I really started growing. I had good mentoring. I was lucky to have that. The best advice I got was to keep it at your own pace and keep it consistent. A very typical example for this is comparing the workplace to physical exercise. It's easy to go out running for 10 minutes. Most people can do that. It's really hard to do that consistently two or three times a week, or once a day for one year, two years, or five years. Will you go out every day? Will you go out even when you have a congestion? Experts say that it's totally fine. Will you go out even on the cold days, when it's raining, when it's snowing? I don't run as much. I cycle a lot. That day was cold, my friends. I can tell you that. This sounds very obvious when we talk about exercise. For many people, it's not so obvious when we talk about our professional career, and it should be. It should be just the same. It's really obvious when you really think about it. When you plan for your career growth, you should acknowledge that you will have highs and lows, and that you will have good days and bad days. That your ambition is important only up to a level, and you should not overdo it. I talked a lot about me during the time from the perspective of someone who is growing. From the perspective of a manager or a leader who's helping someone, we should also identify that. That person who tries to run a marathon on day one. That person who attempts to lift 100 pounds on day one. That's totally impossible, of course. In the work environment, it's sometimes quite obvious as well. Think about that person who only cares about the title specifically or their salary. That person who doesn't care about the project, doesn't care about the company. Especially the person who doesn't care about the team, who doesn't empathize with the human beings around them. That person is a ticking time bomb to any team. They might be good in the short term, they might put out good work or whatever, but that will be very bad for your team and for the company in the longer term. There's a great talk on this topic by Simon Sinek called, "Performance vs Trust". The way he puts it basically, if you put trust in one axis and performance on the other one, performance being how much work they output and trust being how much trust they inspire to their colleagues, to their teammates, of course, nobody wants these folks, and of course, everybody wants these ones. The way he frames it is that you should choose always people from this category over people from this category. It sounds obvious, but sadly in the workspace, it's not so obvious all the time. There's a reason. He goes on to saying that promotion cycles typically tend to favor these individuals. The reason for that being that promotion cycles should be objective and they should be based on real hard data. It's easy to measure performance, but it's really hard to measure trust. How much trust does a colleague inspire? How much do they empower their team to be better just by feeling safe? It's hard to do that. This was called out on the keynote by Lizzie. TAPPs is one framework to do that, there are many others. It's one way to measure it. The truth is, this can be measured and this can be measured as well. It's not impossible. It's more costly and you should do that investment in order to find these folks. The people from this category can be grown into being here in the short-term or in the mid-term. If you find someone here, it's almost impossible to get them here. That was also mentioned by Charlotte. It's really hard to change the character of a person. You can change their capacity. You can help them grow. You can teach them things, but you cannot change who they are. We're going to talk about a few more concrete growth strategies. The first thing I'd like to mention for this is that, any employee attempting to grow should understand the roles and expectations of their company. There's a lot of resources online to do this. Levels.fyi is a great page. There are public career ladders that you can look up. Eventbrite has given me the permission to make our own career ladder public for the purpose of this talk. You can look it up later. There will be links at the end. I'm not going to go through the career ladders here. It's a very big topic. If you're interested in growing, please do your research. There's a lot of interesting resources on this topic. On strategies, I think one of the most important ones is to keep perspective in mind. When you're working on your day-to-day, you should be asking yourself, what is best for me? What is best for my team? What is best for our customers? Also, what is best for my company? This is ambitious for someone who's just starting on their career. They're not going to change their company on day one, of course, but having that perspective is important, understanding how their work connects to their company goals. You should also ask, how and why? How does my company's business model operate? Why is my team focusing on this project in this quarter? Things like that. Why am I being asked to prioritize this task over this other one, which I feel is more important? If you have that ambitious perspective, if you understand your leaders, you will be able to grow faster in your career. This was also mentioned by Dan, on aligning your goals with your leaders' goals. Another strategy, of course, is to find your role models. This is probably the most popular ones. There should always be people you look up to, people you admire. You should try to work with them. Maybe observe how they work. See what they do that you cannot do as well yet. You can approach them and ask them how they learned it, how they built the skill, and how you can build it. They might recommend that you read a book or that you pick up a habit. Maybe you can just ask them to mentor you. Ideally, these are people inside your company, but they can also be people from outside as well. Another thing you should do, of course, is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. We all have strengths and weaknesses. We should do that introspection to try to identify them, but that should always be validated externally because we all have blind spots. That external input is super valuable. As mentors, as leaders, we should make sure that those are clear as well. We should have those uncomfortable conversations with someone. Tell them, your tickets are terrible, you never put enough information. Or, you're not testing your changes and the team has to cover you all the time with tests. Things like that. Sometimes people don't do this knowingly because they're lazy. Or sometimes they're just not aware of it because it's one of their blind spots. If you don't discuss it with them, it's quite unfair to judge them on it. You should make sure that those are clear and discussed always. Of course, you don't have to be good at everything. I really like this type of chart. This was made popular by soccer, particularly soccer video games. It's great at showing how different people have different strengths and weaknesses, and they all come together to form a team that does well. In this case, they don't play together. That's not the point. That's actual feedback given to me in 2020. I remember really being appreciative of the manager who gave me this feedback. It was so visible, so tangible. Like saying, "You're having great productive impact. Your throughput is awesome, but you're doing a lot of rework. You need to work on that. You need to improve that so that I can promote you". This type of feedback is really valuable. As we grow in our career also, things like the playground opens a bit and things become more vague. This was mentioned in the ambiguous role of a principal as well. As a staff, you can choose where you want to put your effort. You can choose to be an architect, but you don't really need to choose only one archetype, as he phrases it. You can choose to be the solver who sometimes acts as a tech lead, or you can shift your time 50-50 between being a tech lead and the right hand. Those are all valuable. There are no rules on how to act. You should find your own place by finding your strengths and finding what your team needs and what your company needs, and how you can apply those strengths. On the next topic, you should always know yourself and acknowledge that you will have highs and lows. Nobody is perfect. It's important that even at your lows, you find ways in which you can stay productive and in which you can stay valuable to your team and to the company. Coming back to strengths and weaknesses, it's important to act on improving your weaknesses, but also, you should maximize your strengths. If you focus on what you're strong in, what comes naturally to you, that's what you should do when you're going through a low. "This work is easy for me, I'm going to focus on this while I'm here, because that's how I can be valuable to the team. Once I'm better, I'm going to focus on fixing my weaknesses and everything, and that'll be ok. Right now, I'm going to focus on what's easy". You should discuss it with your manager, of course, to make sure that he's aligned. You should be open if you're going through a low. Another thing is what energizes you and what drains you. A typical example is social interactions. Human beings are social beings by nature. We need that oxytocin. We need that serotonin. Different brains need them at different levels. Some people get them at work, and some people don't. Some people, when they go through a technical topic, a really difficult challenge, they need to discuss that challenge with someone else. After discussing it, they come out energized off the meeting and are more productive for the following hours. A bunch of other people come out of the meeting totally drained and need some time to recuperate. That's perfectly fine. Another example is how people act under pressure. Typically, this is during incidents. I am the type of person that's energized by an incident. I'm fueled by it. I love the team that comes together, the strong dedication and collaboration. Some people just loathe it. They don't like working under pressure, and they like to pace their work more slowly. As a recent example, a short time ago, me and a colleague, another staff engineer, we were both transferred from one team to another. That basically creates a lull. The whole team starts forming, storming, norming, performing again, and we were both out of our domain. We didn't know what we were doing, basically. The other guy goes to our manager and says, "I'm going to take it slow. I'm going to take my time to learn. I'm not going to be productive during the time that I'm learning, but that's going to make me more productive in the future, and I think it's a good investment". The manager says, "That's great. Thank you". I come up to the manager and I tell him, "I need that feedback. I need this action. I'm going to take the on-call for a while. Let me deal with the incidents. That's how I can be valuable to the team fast. That's how I can provide value with what I know. Also, that's a way for me to learn fast". The manager says, "That's perfect. Thank you". He was very appreciative that we were both open about our strengths and weaknesses and that we found ways in which to apply them to the team. Two different persons, two different approaches, both were perfectly valid, the right one for each person. Let's talk a bit about opportunities. It's very important to recognize opportunities and to know how to act on them. The typical opportunity, the ideal one, like the Holy Grail, is company growth. Of course, if a company is growing, they will shape up new teams. There will be opportunity for you to grow within them. Another opportunity is an open position above you. If a tech lead or a manager leaves the team or leaves a company, that position is open, and you can offer yourself to fill it. That's sometimes a double-blade sword because there's typically a reason why they left the company. You should make sure that whichever challenges they were facing at the time are challenges that you can deal with better than them, if those were the reasons why he left. It's typically good to discuss that with the person who's leaving instead of with the people who remain around you. Another opportunity is challenging times. This is the most difficult one, maybe. A lot of companies have been through layoffs lately, and that can create opportunity for growth, even as challenging as it is. There is the concept of anti-fragile. The typical example is in the film Superman vs. Batman, where we have Doomsday: each time you hit him, he becomes stronger. A flower vase is fragile, if you hit it, it breaks. Doomsday, you hit him and he becomes stronger. As an employee, some people, when they get hit through going through a challenging time, they come out stronger. Those people are super valuable to a company, and it's really hard to find them. It's one way in which you can change a challenging time into being an opportunity. Finally, if you don't have opportunities, you should try to create them. You can propose initiatives for your company or for your team. You can maybe ask to be transferred to another team or choose to leave the company. Or you can do things outside of your day job, like coming to a conference, for example. This topic of creating your own opportunities was perfectly covered by Pablo, on finding your dinosaurs. I suggest you look that up as well. Another thing you should do if you want growth is to find ways to make your work be visible. The first thing, you should always keep a track of your work. When you're beginning your career, this might sound unnecessary, but once you've worked 5, 10, 15 years, it becomes really hard to remember what you were doing 2, 3 years ago. Sometimes it's good to keep a document. Julia Evans has a great article on this. It's called the brag document, where you brag about your own work. This is also very valuable when companies are going through change. Typically, your manager can change, sometimes in the same year, you have two or three managers, and they lose that context of what you've done. It's very hard to transfer that from one manager to another. It's much easier for them if you provide them with a brag document, where they can track that work with a paper trail. Another thing is to publish your work. This topic was also covered by Pablo. Make sure that your contributions are seen. Aaron Francis has a great article on this, publishing your work, and how it increases your luck. Finally, let's talk about leaders for a bit. Once you've grown, what can you expect? When we think about staff engineers and principal engineers, one way to define them is how they can impact a large group, like broader than a team, and sometimes how they can impact an entire company. One way we typically do that is setting guidelines on how the company should work, or how the team should work, or the pillar, or whatever you call it in your company. You can work in establishing team boundaries and structures. You can work to define the software development life cycle: how we do PRs, how we do testing. Giuliano from Mercado Libre mentioned at QCon, absolute freedom is not good for companies. We should give the teams those guidelines, and we as leaders should be the ones doing that. Also, we should strive to identify when there are new patterns or new necessities. Once we have set those guidelines, something can fall through the cracks between them, and some team might choose to go on their own path. At Eventbrite, the way we approach this is by setting a golden path. We don't have a strict guideline on what teams can do. We give them a golden path, and we say, if you use these technologies and this software development life cycle, your life will be easy. We will take care of your problems for you. If you choose to strive out of that, you're on your own. You're a lone wolf. You need to take care of your own infra, your own platform, and everything. It's not forbidden, but it'll be more work for your team. One thing that we need to do is to maintain that. One team might be a lone wolf, but if we have two, three, four, five teams doing the same thing, it's not lone wolves, it's now a new pack. We need to put them back into the golden path by saying, this pattern that you're using is now part of a golden path because we see it becoming a new necessity that our company will have. Another thing is that when we grow to become leaders, you remember that person looking up to their leaders? Once you become this person, you are the person they look up to. Your work must not only be good anymore. Your work must be exemplary because people will look up to you. They will imitate you. They will copy how you work. Sometimes we feel that given our growth, we have great judgment, and we know when to cut corners, which changes we can push without testing, or whatever, which risks we can take, which corners we can cut. We do have that judgment, and we can make those calls, but we should be very cautious. It might be best not to make them only for the sake of being exemplary. If you choose to do that, some people might imitate you and choose to start cutting corners at their own judgment, and their judgment might be not as good as yours. That creates a challenge for the company. It's best if you choose to never cut corners so that you instill that way of working in your company, because it permeates into company culture without you knowing it. You should always be aware of that when you're a leader. Finally, and most importantly, we must stand for our peers and subordinates when we feel like they're being treated unfairly. Sometimes, as team leads or tech leads, we see how things operate within a team, and someone from above might not have that visibility, and unfairly blame someone for something that wasn't really their fault. It's our job to come up to them and tell them, "You're misunderstanding the situation. This person was not at fault here. There was a fault at the process. We should look into that instead of blaming the person". Remember, be ambitious, stay focused, be efficient, find your opportunities, and most importantly, take care of yourselves. Participant 1: I feel like when you grow in your career, you take on tasks which you didn't really do when you were more junior. It's like novel tasks. Have you seen opportunities, if you look back at your career, on how to maybe develop those skills when you don't necessarily have a chance to put them in practice? Rey: Yes, it's hard. It's good to try to jump the gun, and be ready before those necessities come. It's good to try to develop those necessities for yourself. I think it comes back to the early part of my talk, not aim for perfection, and aim for execution instead. I will not focus on what I will need in the future, I will focus on what I need today, and start being great at that. Once you have that covered, you can start looking into that. Without having the actual necessity and without having the opportunity to apply that in a productive environment, it becomes really hard to develop that on your own. The obvious way to do it is for tech skills, try to have some pet projects or whatever on the side that you can test new technologies or whatever. I wouldn't put too much effort into developing something that you might or might not need. If you were to do that, I would frame it like looking at your role models and looking at how they work. Because you can confirm that those are skills that are actually needed in your company. How do you develop them? The best thing to do is to ask them directly how you can develop those skills. Participant 2: As you mentioned, someone got hit, but then they got stronger. Do you think you're that kind of person, or what traits does this person have? Rey: I cannot tell you which kind of traits this person has. I sometimes can identify them, but I cannot put it into words yet. It's not a skill that I have developed. I wouldn't say that I'm that type of person all the time, but I have had opportunities where I came out stronger off a challenging situation. My whole team was let go at once and I was the only member who remained there. That was very challenging, but it was also very accelerating to my career growth. I think anybody has the capacity to do that, given the right environment. Environments, when they're challenging, people around us can help us to mitigate that challenge and come out stronger. Participant 3: What made you change teams and what advice would you give to someone considering that? Rey: Sometimes it's your choice and sometimes it isn't. If there's a topic that's of your interest, you should discuss that with your managers, your leaders, and tell them, I would like to work in this team in the future. It doesn't need to be this week, it doesn't need to be this quarter, but I would like to aim my career in that direction. Sometimes companies go through big reorgs and it's not your choice to end up in one team or another, but it is up to you to make the most out of it. It comes back to the big team player framework. How can I make the most out of this situation? It's challenging because you don't have the domain expertise, you don't have the knowledge, but you need to acknowledge that it's going to be a rough patch in your career where you need more time to learn, but that it can also be an opportunity if you can make this team succeed by now having you, and how you can do that. Participant 4: When you're just a junior engineer and you've been in your company for a good bit and you start to recognize some inefficiencies across the organization and the processes, do you think at that level you can already start to plan these initiatives and try to influence direction, or is that something you really have to wait for once you can achieve that level and have that influence? I'm curious on your perspective on that. Rey: I think it really depends on the context. It's not the same thing to do that at a company with 10,000 employees against doing that at a startup with 20 employees. If you're a junior at a startup, you're very well empowered to make those initiatives. Large companies tend to favor diversity of voices lately and tend to try to listen to anyone. There's the opportunity to do that, but it's much harder to come up with a real idea that will actually change the company if it's so big. I think you can always do it, but it's going to be much easier if the company is smaller.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Price Levels as Stock Surges on News That China Chip Exports to Resume

Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped premarket trading on Tuesday after the AI investor favorite said it plans to resume selling one of its most popular chips to China. The chipmaker, which recently became the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization, said it's filing applications with the U.S. government to resume sales of its H20 graphics processing unit (GPU) and has been given assurances that licenses will be granted. Nvidia also unveiled a new chip specifically for China called the RTX Pro GPU, which the company said is fully compliant with U.S. export controls and suitable for use in smart factories and logistics. Through Monday's close, Nvidia shares had gained nearly 90% from their early-April low and were up 22% since the start of the year, as major tech companies continue to ramp up spending on AI infrastructure that depends on the company's chips. The stock was up more than 4% at around $171 before the opening bell on Tuesday. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After reclaiming the closely watched 200-day moving average (MA) in mid-May, Nvidia shares have continued to trend higher, a move that has coincided with the relative strength index staying near its overbought threshold for most of that time, signaling strong price momentum. In another win for the bulls, the 50-day MA crossed back above the 200-day MA in late June to form a golden cross, a bullish chart pattern that points to a new trend higher. However, trading volume and volatility have contracted in recent months, suggesting market participants may be waiting for the chipmaker’s earnings report next month before deploying further capital. Let’s analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart to project where the shares may be headed if the uptrend continues and also identity support levels worth watching during potential retracements in the stock. Investors can apply bars pattern analysis to predict how the stock’s current trending move may play out. When applying this technique to Nvidia’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher throughout June and reposition it from this month’s low. This projects a price target of around $178, implying about 8% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this earlier trend as it followed a minor profit-taking dip, closely mimicking the current price action after a similar brief pullback at the start of July. The first lower level worth watching sits around $159. Retracements in the stock could initially find support near last month’s high. Selling below this level could see the shares touch support near the key $150 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this location near a series of peaks that formed on the chart between November and January. Finally, a more significant pullback in Nvidia shares opens the door for a retest of lower support around $143. This area may attract buying interest near a consolidation period that developed on the chart in mid-June, which also aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity stretching back to late October.

Title: Secure Dividends Up To 12% From The $3+ Trillion ‘Human Bailout’

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. High Yield, Low Risk Road Sign A nifty dividend duo—with yields of 9% and 12%—is ready for takeoff. Thanks to Uncle Sam’s spending bender coinciding with the rise of the machines. Big tech stocks are about to remind Wall Street why it fell in love with these shares in the first place. Think you’ve seen a tech bubble before? Just wait until tech firms report earnings later this month! These companies are growing sales and profits by deploying robots instead of hiring humans. Their AI-driven tools are faster, more scalable, and much cheaper than carbon-based labor. Cost savings are dropping straight to tech bottom lines. Expect proof of trend as the Nasdaq’s increasingly machine-driven companies report banner earnings in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Washington’s $3+ trillion fiscal “open bar” is officially flowing. Policymakers saw a negative GDP print in Q1 and have rapidly revved up the stimulus spigots to avoid a technical recession. Nothing creates market excitement like stimulus cocktails ahead of midterms. As we approach election season, the Fed is under pressure. Will Fed Chair Jay Powell last his final 10 months? I wouldn’t bet on Jay—not when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stands ready to step in and potentially lower the Fed Funds Rate by 300 basis points almost overnight. Talk about bullish fuel! This backdrop makes us contrarians bullish on stocks—with a twist. We could buy and hope for higher prices, but why? Instead, we can engineer dividend yields of 9% and 12% simply by “selling volatility.” To do this we consider covered call funds, which manufacture sweet synthetic dividends with upside price potential to boot. Take Christopher Dyer of Eaton-Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversity Equity Fund (EXG). Chris owns significant stakes in Alphabet (GOOG), owner of Waymo, the autonomous “robot” car company. My kids couldn’t stop talking about it after our recent San Francisco trip. Alphabet itself is becoming “autonomous.” Human hiring has halted. Yet despite flat headcount in the last year, revenues still grew by double digits—14%! Surviving highly-paid “Googlers” are understandably anxious. They developed Gemini, Alphabet’s AI tool, now being deployed enterprise-wide to automate countless tasks. Yes, they created their own monster. Chris’s next big holding for EXG is Amazon (AMZN). CEO Andy Jassy openly acknowledges that Amazon’s workforce will shrink over the next few years. Today may well be “peak headcount!” Microsoft (MSFT), Chris’s largest holding, laid off 6,000 employees in May and another 9,000 just last week. Yet Microsoft isn’t downsizing. It’s upsizing efficiency by rolling out its AI-driven sales and marketing teams, creating “driverless” departments that are equally effective and far cheaper. Tic tac toe, three AI-driven cash cows in a row. Chris is primed to enjoy an impressive earnings season. Remarkably, EXG still trades at a 6% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Meaning, we can grab MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN shares for just 94 cents on the dollar, right ahead of strong earnings. In the meantime, Chris boosts income by selling (writing) covered calls on broad market indexes to generate extra income. Hence EXG’s nifty 9% yield. Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD), managed by Nam To and Wayne Xie, follows a similar strategy and yields an attractive 12%. XYLD holds a substantial 40% tech allocation, capturing this automation-driven profitability boom. However, unlike closed-end fund EXG, XYLD trades at fair value—so no additional discount benefit here. The broader automation trend clearly impacts employment numbers. Last week’s headline 147,000 job gain appeared solid. But removing 73,000 new government jobs (aside: weren’t they supposed to be cutting?) leaves only a gain of 74,000 private-sector positions, significantly below the expected 105,000. Payroll processing firm ADP’s numbers last week were even harsher, a 33,000 private-sector job loss signaling AI’s impact already. The machines are here for the jobs. But we, my fellow contrarians, are here for the payouts—specifically the nifty 9% and terrific 12% yields I’m calling out. It’s big and already starting. Corporate automation plus a $3+ trillion spending bender from Uncle Sam is a powerful recipe for higher stock prices and bigger dividends. Let’s ignore the “tariff worry” headlines. We are following the money, and it is dropping straight into the tech bros’ coffers. Let’s scrape some serious payouts and profits from this soon-to-be uncovered megatrend.

Title: Apple Should Fire CEO Tim Cook, Says Research Firm – But Will It Happen Anytime Soon?

Apple CEO Tim Cook should step down, says analysts at research firm LightShed, although it doesn’t expect to see the company make any changes soon. In a note to clients seen by Bloomberg, LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone say that “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics.” Apple shares have taken a bit of a hit this year, as Apple has proven to not be up to competing in the Artificial intelligence race.Â While Meta and Microsoft shares have enjoyed gains of 25% and 19%, respectively, Apple share prices have taken a 16% hit so far in 2025. From Piecyk and Joe Galone’s note: Missing on AI could fundamentally alter the company’s long-term trajectory and ability to grow at all. AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties. It should be noted that since Cook took over, Apple shares have gained over 1,400% , compared to 430% for the S&P 500. This indicates that this year’s stock price slide is but a blip in Apple’s overall performance under Cook. LightShed’s note to investors comes in the wake of the announcement that AppleÂ Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will be stepping down from his position later this month. Sabih Khan will be stepping into the COO role once Williams vacates his office. 30-year Apple veteran Williams had been considered as a potential successor for Cook. Now, Appleâs senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, is now considered to be the top candidate for the job. LightShed says “âTim Cookâ was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” but now that Williams is departing, “it’s time for more disruptive change, not less.” However, we shouldn’t expect to see Cook step down from his CEO role anytime soon. As pointed out byÂ Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, there are no immediate successors on the horizon. Plus, Cook doesn’t appear to be ready to step down and hasn’t shown any willingness to groom a successor. Plus, as Gurman points out, the Apple board seems content to keep having Cook pilot the company’s direction.Apple’s board of directors includes several Cook loyalists, such as Susan Wagner, Ronald Sugar, and Arthur Levinson. Gurman believe Cook could even tighten his grip on the Apple reins, as he could take over the role of Chairman, as Apple’s current Chairman, Levinson has already passed the company’s recommended board retirement age. Levinson could retire and Cook could slip into the Chairman role. We’ve seen this happen at other tech firms, with Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella making that move at their companies.

Title: Unlimited Rolls Out Two New Hedge Fund Replication ETFs

Full Content:
July 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited and its CEO and CIO, Bob Elliott, today rolled out two new actively managed ETFs: the Unlimited HFMF Managed Futures ETF (HFMF) and the Unlimited HFEQ Equity Long/Short ETF (HFEQ), offering investors exposure to managed futures and equity long/short hedge fund strategies, respectively. These latest additions to the Unlimited lineup align with Unlimited’s mission to provide investors with access to transparent, liquid, and cost-effective hedge fund-style returns. These new strategies will allocate across a diversified basket of ETFs and exchange-listed futures contracts, adjusting dynamically based on evolving market conditions. Today’s launch expands Unlimited’s ETF roster to cover the primary hedge fund strategy sectors. “With the addition of our Managed Futures and Equity Long/Short strategies, Unlimited now offers complementary strategies to help achieve diversification in a wide range of investor portfolios,” said Mr. Elliott. “Deploying these strategies in the ETF wrapper, which offers intraday liquidity, affords the manager flexibility to adjust through volatile markets.” Each of Unlimited’s sector ETFs were designed to offer a volatility target aligned with equity markets as an investor-friendly way to add the diversification features of alternatives to a balanced portfolio: Over time, high fees and inefficient tax structures in hedge funds erode returns, and top tier private funds are often inaccessible to the majority of investors. Unlimited developed proprietary machine learning technology to analyze near real-time hedge fund investment returns and efficiently replicate the underlying exposures while maintaining an expense ratio significantly lower than the standard “2 & 20” hedge fund fee model. Unlimited’s ETFs are managed by Mr. Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates, and Bruce McNevin, co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at Unlimited. Mr. McNevin brings extensive experience in quantitative modeling and data science. For more information on Unlimited HFMF, HFEQ, HFGM and HFND please visit https://www.unlimitedetfs.com/. About UnlimitedFounded in 2022 by Bob Elliott, Bruce McNevin and Matt Salzberg, Unlimited is an investment firm using proprietary technology to create strategies that offer lower-cost access to 2 & 20-style alternative investment strategies, such as hedge funds, to a wide range of investors. Mr. Elliott has built innovative hedge fund strategies for more than two decades, including at Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. Mr. McNevin is a Professor of Economics at New York University and has held various data science positions at hedge funds Clinton Group and Midway Group, along with positions at Bank of America and BlackRock. Mr. Salzberg is a Co-Founder and Chairman of various companies, including Unlimited. Learn more at unlimitedfunds.com. Media Contacts: Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by visiting www.unlimitedetfs.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Important RisksUnderlying ETFs Risks. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in Underlying ETFs. There is also the risk that the Fund may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of securities held by the Underlying ETFs. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. Machine Learning, Model and Data Risk. The Fund relies heavily on proprietary “machine learning” selection processes. In addition, the composition of the Fund’s portfolio is heavily dependent on proprietary quantitative models as well as information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”). Volatility Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a higher level of volatility than its target hedge fund industry sector, which may result in substantial price fluctuations over short periods. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise or fall significantly, and investors should be prepared for increased levels of volatility compared to traditionalequity funds. Commodity Risk. Underlying ETFs that invest in the commodities markets may subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s or an Underlying ETF’s derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets or index; the loss of principal, including the potential loss of amounts greater than the initial amount invested in the derivative instrument; the possible default of the other party to the transaction; and illiquidity of the derivative investments. Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in securities issued by companies domiciled or headquartered in emerging market nations. Investments in securities traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, currency, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and investments in more developed international markets. Fixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in fixed income securities. The prices of fixed income securities may be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing fixed income securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration and/or higher quality fixed income securities. Foreign Securities Risk. Foreign securities held by Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Futures Contracts Risk. The Fund or Underlying ETFs may invest in futures contracts.Risks of futures contracts include: (i) an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying asset; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market; (iii) the inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iv) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which may be unlimited; (v) an obligation for the Fund or an Underlying ETF, as applicable, to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin, particularly at times when the Fund or Underlying ETF may have insufficient cash; and (vi) unfavorable execution prices from rapid selling. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Short Selling Risk. The Fund may make short sales of securities of Underlying ETFs, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the price of the security will decline. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to buy (“cover”) the security sold short when the security has appreciated in value or is unavailable, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. Short sales also involve the risk that losses may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited. Swap Agreement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying ETF may invest in swap agreements. Swap agreements could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. Swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses. They are also subject to counterparty risk. If the counterparty fails to meet its obligations, the Fund (or the Underlying Fund) may lose money. Definitions:2 & 20 strategy: Describes the standard fee structure charged by advisers of private funds, which generally includes a 2% asset-based management fee, in addition to a 20% performance fee charged on the profits on investments.

Title: Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick team up to promote energy investments in Pennsylvania

By SEUNG MIN KIM and MARC LEVY, Associated Press PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania touted tens of billions of dollars of energy and technology investments Tuesday as the president traveled to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. At the summit, Trump Cabinet officials spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the artificial intelligence race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during a panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects, while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. Blackstone said it will spend $25 billion on data centers and power infrastructure in northeastern Pennsylvania, Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in southcentral Pennsylvania. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. Administration officials speaking at the summit included White House crypto czar David Sacks, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Lutnick. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pa.

US stock market futures today are mixed as the Nasdaq‑100 jumps over 0.6%, powered by a 5% rise in Nvidia shares after the tech giant got the green light to resume H20 AI chip shipments to China. The S&P 500 climbs around +0.4%, hitting new highs with strong earnings optimism and cooling inflation data. Meanwhile, Dow Jones futures dip 0.1%, weighed by rising trade tariff concerns. The market reflects a tug-of-war between AI-driven tech gains and global trade tension risks—setting the stage for a volatile but opportunity-filled trading session ahead.

Title: The Elder Scrolls VI and a new Fallout: Xbox insider alleges exciting developments regarding two of Xbox's biggest franchises

Microsoft recently shook up its gaming division with tons of layoffs and multiple project cancellations. Among the canceled projects, there was ZeniMax Online’s unannounced “Project Blackbird” MMO RPG. It now appears that the cancellation of ZeniMax’s game might’ve given life to another Bethesda project, one that many fans have been asking for. In the latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast, Jez Corden claims that Microsoft decided to cancel ZeniMax’s MMO to allocate the capital to the development of Fallout 5. As such, the development of Fallout 5 has seemingly been greenlit. This is certainly good news for Fallout fans who have been disappointed by Fallout 76 and are waiting for a direct, single-player sequel to Fallout 4. Unfortunately, Jez reveals nothing about the potential Fallout 5 release date nor does he suggest anything about which studio is handling the development. Seeing as how Bethesda is busy supporting Fallout 76, Starfield, and is developing The Elder Scroll VI, it is difficult to imagine that the company has the bandwidth to start development of Fallout 5. Fortunately, Microsoft has another prolific RPG-maker in Obsidian. Assuming Obsidian is the studio behind Fallout 5, this wouldn’t be surprising as the studio has already worked on a Fallout game in the past, Fallout: New Vegas, which was quite well received. In addition to confirming Fallout 5, Jez also shares an interesting update regarding The Elder Scrolls VI. Back in June, before the Xbox Showcase 2025 aired, we reported that Microsoft could premier The Elder Scrolls VI at the event. The news came to us from Jez Corden who now alleges hearing that The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in a playable state. This was reportedly the basis for Jez’s earlier speculation that the game could show up at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. We must mention here that, aside from a short teaser trailer from 2018, Bethesda hasn’t revealed anything important about The Elder Scrolls VI. So, we have no idea how far along in development the game is or when it might release. If we have to speculate, we could see The Elder Scrolls VI release date falling sometime in 2027 to coincide with the launch of the next-gen Xbox. Having a game as big as The Elder Scrolls VI be a launch title for a new Xbox console would be a pretty big deal, as Sony is sure to prepare some heavy hitter for the PS6’s alleged 2027 release date. Before we take our leave, we must mention that we have no way of confirming these rumors. So, take the information with a giant grain of salt.

Title: What analysts and investors want to hear from CFOs this earnings season
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/what-analysts-investors-want-hear-cfo-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T11:38:29Z
Full Content:
Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily. Good morning. As the Q2 2025 earnings season begins, CFOs are navigating a landscape shaped by new tariffs, shifting consumer demand, and heightened market scrutiny. The first quarter benefited from a pull-forward of demand ahead of anticipated tariffs. In contrast, the second quarter will test companies’ ability to manage margin pressure, supply chain disruptions, and evolving trade policy risks. Major U.S. banks are among the first to report results this week. For all companies reporting, analysts will be “laser-focused” on how President Donald Trump’s import taxes are affecting corporate profits, according to Morningstar. A key theme is the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, with analysts closely watching for margin pressures, signs of slowing consumer demand, how companies are preparing for new tariffs, and how they are handling levies that have already been implemented. Markets have remained relatively calm heading into Q2, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently reaching new highs. Morningstar notes that Q2 earnings are expected to reveal trends among firms in tariff-affected industries. Companies with higher costs and tighter margins may be forced to absorb more tariff expenses, while those with stronger competitive advantages may be able to pass more costs onto consumers. The momentum that propelled the S&P 500 to nearly an 11% gain in Q2 and more than 7% year-to-date will be tested this week, according to Saira Malik, chief investment officer at global investment manager Nuveen. Malik highlighted in a LinkedIn post on Monday two key dynamics: Q2 earnings reports from the financial sector, and a series of U.S. economic data releases, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for release this morning. Malik adds, “While overall earnings growth is expected to decelerate from last quarter, estimates have stabilized in recent weeks after falling sharply in early April. Still, the Q2 earnings bar is relatively low.” On the economic front, Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard, expects core CPI to increase 0.25% month over month (2.9% year over year) and headline CPI to rise 0.29% month over month (2.6% year over year), reflecting moderate strength following May’s soft print. “While tariff-related pressures are beginning to show in select goods categories in the PCE, the overall pass-through into CPI remains limited for now as firms hold off on retail price hikes,” he said in an emailed statement. Regarding CFO sentiment, Deloitte’s Q2 2025 CFO Signals report, released last week, found that growth expectations declined across every key operational metric, with finance chiefs lowering projections for revenue, earnings, and capital investments. However, Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte’s CFO Program, described the current environment as a recalibration, not a retreat. Finance leaders are doubling down on fundamentals: sharpening focus on growth drivers, managing controllable risks, and staying active in M&A. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leeny Oberg, CFO and EVP of development at Marriott International (No. 171) has decided to retire effective March 31, 2026, after spending more than two decades with the U.S. hotel operator. Oberg, CFO since 2016, will be succeeded by Jen Mason, who joined Marriott in 1992 and currently serves as global officer, treasurer and risk management. Mason is also a former CFO of the U.S. and Canada at the company. Shawn Hill was promoted to the role of EVP and chief development officer, effective Jan. 1. Oberg has been in that role since February 2023. Every Friday morning, the weekly Fortune 500 Power Moves column tracks Fortune 500 company C-suite shifts—see the most recent edition. Mark Mesler has stepped down from his position as CFO of Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR), effective July 7, according to an SEC filing. Mesler had been on medical leave since September 2024. During his absence, Priya Gupta has served as CFO and acting principal financial officer. Gupta will continue in these roles. Harsh Rungta will also remain as SVP of finance and chief accounting officer and principal accounting officer. Sarah C. Young was appointed CFO at Bell Partners, a privately held company specializing in apartment investment and management, and will succeed John Tomlinson upon his planned retirement effective Aug. 22. Young joined the company on July 14 and will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners. After his retirement, Tomlinson will remain as an advisor to the company through the end of 2025. Young previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of homebuilder Lennar, where she worked for 10 years. Before that, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)’s Q2 2025 Quarterly Survey found that 62% of directors cite shifting economic conditions as the top business issue for boards. Also, in the findings from the 305 directors surveyed, AI now outranks cybersecurity, supply chains, and even talent competition in terms of business issues. Although AI remains a top focus, NACD says it is clear from survey responses that organizations are in very different positions with respect to AI adoption and implementation. Some companies are in the middle of the implementation of AI projects, working to “move beyond pilots to deployments” or focusing on improving governance of AI, including determining “where it can be implemented and why, and internal controls around verification of output.” “Elon Musk spent months slashing federal contracts—Now his AI company is celebrating a $200M Pentagon contract and new unit to get government business” is a new Fortune report by Jessica Mathews. Elon Musk’s xAI, a two-year-old AI company, said in a blog post Monday that it has launched a new division, called “Grok with Government,” and signed a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense, Mathews writes. xAI also announced that it had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products will now be available for purchase across every government office and agency.

Title: Texas officials defend flood response and Tucker Carlson criticizes Trump: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Republican strategists want lawmakers to get specific when selling the “big, beautiful bill” to voters. State and local officials defend their response to the catastrophic floods in Central Texas. And Tucker Carlson explains why he’s pushing back against some of Trump’s recent decisions. Here’s what to know today. Now that Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is signed into law, it’s likely the president will continue to use the alliterative turn of phrase he coined in talking about the legislation. But those in his own party, as well as Democrats, know those superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the price of gas and groceries — so they’re setting out to explain what the bill means for daily life. Two Republican strategists said they’re advising lawmakers to use different titles — such as the “Working Family Tax Cuts” act or possibly the “Trump Working Family Tax Cuts” — when referring to the legislation. The aim is to allude to policies, like no taxes on tips or overtime, that were popular among Trump voters. They’re also advising lawmakers to tout the additional money going to states for border enforcement. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The White House also believes that other parts of the bill that may not have gotten as much attention are widely popular. For example, Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation’s air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act. Trump, however, isn’t planning to traverse the nation to pitch the bill to voters. Instead, it’ll fall largely on his administration. An early test comes tomorrow, when Vice President JD Vance gives a speech at a machine shop in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to highlight how the bill “helps working class people most of all,” a person familiar with the speech said. Democrats, meanwhile, are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn. At stake is control of Congress, which is up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections. Read the full story here. Local and state officials who responded to the catastrophic flooding this month in Central Texas said they did everything in their power to save lives. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, Kerr County Commissioner Jeff Holt and state Rep. Wes Virdell told NBC News over the weekend that officials did their best to coordinate evacuations and rescues against uncontrollable forces of nature. "Our teams did everything they possibly could with this gruesome, devastating situation that happened, and we would not change the way we did that. And I think we saved as many people as we could," Rice said. However, the officials noted that a permanent emergency operations center, more diversion dams and better cellphone service in certain areas might save lives in future floods. At least 132 people have died after the Guadalupe River surged to unprecedented heights in the early morning of July 4. More than 160 people are still missing. Kerr County and Kerrville officials held separate meetings yesterday about the ongoing flood response, though they mostly steered clear of addressing speculation over how leaders communicated about the floods. Read the full story here. A study of more than 1.2 million people found that there is no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. The study, published yesterday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, used Denmark’s nationwide registry to study people born between 1997 and 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared to those who received less. The study looked for connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions and five neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD. Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said on a 2024 podcast that aluminum in vaccines is “extremely neurotoxic.” Read the full story here. NBC News' politics team has been closely tracking MAGA influencers raising the alarm about some the moves by President Donald Trump and his administration — whether that means bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, floating a deportation carve-out for undocumented farm workers or shutting down the release of additional information on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. No one’s pushback garnered more curiosity, though, than Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host-turned-"America First" thought leader who was gifted a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last summer. Carlson had been aligned closely with the president after both men found themselves in exile after Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 election. I was able to get Carlson on the phone and ask about what’s been driving his recent criticism. “I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson told me last week, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.” Carlson spoke with me at a key moment for MAGA that is testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump, the man who brought the movement together, can shift its direction. If any of these influencers can play a role in shaping Trump's right-wing alliance, it's Carlson. — Allan Smith, politics reporter Want to perfectly block out other sounds or run with perfectly balanced audio?

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Jensen Huang is not an AI doomer, but he said developing tech could cause job losses if humans can’t come up with new ideas. As CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker now worth $4 trillion, Huang has a unique insight on the acceleration of AI adoption, and most of what he sees is positive. While some AI critics have warned the technology will lead to mass layoffs, Huang said it’s not likely. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” Huang told CNN. Just take a look at history: over the hundreds of years past as technology advanced, productivity gains went hand-in-hand with employment gains, said Huang. “Over the course of the last 300 years, 100 years, 60 years, even, in the era of computers, not only did productivity go up, employment also went up,” he said. “Now the reason for that is if we have an abundance of ideas, ways that we could build a better future, if we were more productive, we could realize that better.” The development of AI could also help humans by helping to surface new ideas across industries. The possibility of adding AI-enabled robots to fill the 30- to 40-million worker gap in skilled labor could also be positive and could help industry and the economy grow. Yet, without new ventures and ideas, the future looks more bleak, he said. “If you have no more ideas and all you want to do is this, then productivity drives down. It results in job loss.” Huang’s comments stand in stark contrast to those of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who said AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white collar jobs and spike unemployment by double digits over the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also warned AI will reduce the company’s total corporate workforce. Huang stands out as one of the more optimistic leaders in the AI space, although he noted that AI will certainly transform all jobs, and has already changed his own responsibilities. Although, he cheekily noted, he is still doing the job. Rather than fully replace humans, AI is already supercharging their productivity by equalizing the playing field, and hopefully, the productivity gains lift society, he added. “AI empowers people, it lifts people, it closes the gap, the technology gap, and as a result more and more people are going to be able to do more things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Find a menopause practitioner at the following menopause societies or check our Menopause Provider Directory for more Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural biological process, experienced by half the population. Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first. Further reading for vaginal atrophy: What happened to my luscious locks? Half of menopausal women notice changes to hair texture and hair loss. According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.

Title: Nvidia says it will resume sale of key AI chip to China
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/business/nvidia-resume-h20-chip-sales-to-china-intl-hnk
Time Published: 2025-07-15T05:44:55Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: American chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) says it plans to resume sales to China of an artificial intelligence chip that’s become part of a global race pitting the world’s biggest economies against each other. The company’s announcement on Monday comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week. Huang has argued that restricting sales of American technology to China could put the US position as a global AI leader at risk — and the company had also said the restrictions were causing it to miss out on billions of dollars in lost revenue. AMD, another major chipmaker, said on Tuesday that it too was planning to restart sales of its AI chips to China. “We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review,” the company said in a statement to CNN. “We plan to resume shipments as licenses are approved. We applaud the progress made by the Trump Administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg in an interview Tuesday that the Nvidia export controls have been a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks, in which the two countries have made a deal to lower tariffs charged on one another. The same day Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the resumption of Nvidia’s AI chip sales to China was part of the trade agreement with Beijing on rare earths. “We put that in the trade deal with the magnets,” he told Reuters, referring to rare earth magnets. China’s controls on rare earth exports became a major focus in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington in London last month. In exchange for increasing shipments of the critical resources, the US also agreed to lift export curbs on microchip designing software, ethane and jet engines. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, and last week became the first publicly traded firm to reach a valuation of $4 trillion, thanks to its role in the artificial intelligence market. The company’s chips are used to power technologies ranging from AI chatbots to robotics and self-driving cars. Nvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company’s sales in 2024 — in the face of strict US export controls. But in April, the White House told the company it would need a special license to export the H20 to China, forcing the company to halt sales. The H20 is widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model. On Monday, Nvidia said that it had applied to sell the H20 in China again and received assurances from the US government that those licenses will be approved, allowing the company to “start deliveries soon.” Related article Nvidia’s CEO says the US should ‘reduce’ dependency on other countries, onshore technology manufacturing The US government has sought to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. But Huang has argued that if American technology companies are restricted from selling to China, Chinese developers will simply create their own, which could undermine US leadership. “In order for America to be the world leader, just like we want the world to be built on the American dollar, using the American dollar as a global standard, we want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” Huang told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. “We love that the internet is created by American technology and is built on American technology, and so we should continue to aspire to that.” The chipmaker said in May that it missed out on $2.5 billion in additional revenue that would have come from H20 sales to China during the first quarter of 2025 and expected another $8 billion revenue loss during the second quarter. Last month, Nvidia said it would no longer include China in its sales and profit forecasts because of uncertainty surrounding export controls. Huang is scheduled to hold a media briefing in Beijing on Wednesday when he attends a supply chain expo, his second visit to China after a trip in April where he stressed the importance of the Chinese market.

Title: NVIDIA Successfully Negotiates The Resumption Of H20 GPU Sales In China, Unveils A New GPU For The Chinese Market

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In a dramatic turn of events, NVIDIA's Jensen Huang seems to have achieved unparalleled success during his recent meeting with President Trump at the White House, winning for his company a dual reprieve in relation to the prevailing restrictions on the sale of American silicon chips in China. Nvidia $NVDA CEO Jensen Huang just said:Nvidia will resume H20 sales to China 🇨🇳 with a new compliant GPU which the US 🇺🇸 has reportedly assured Nvidia it will grant licenses forHere is the full statement from Nvidia:"This month, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang… pic.twitter.com/MKZwdHnplg To wit, NVIDIA has just announced that it is filing an application with the US government to resume the sale of H20 GPUs in China. NVIDIA claims that it has been assured by US officials that it will receive the requisite authorization promptly. As such, the company hopes to "soon" commence deliveries of the H20 GPUs to China. Moreover, NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has also announced a new, dedicated AI GPU for China - an RTX PRO variant - that reportedly meets the requirements of the Trump administration and "is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics." As a refresher, the Trump administration had formally communicated to NVIDIA on the 09th of April that it's China-specific H20 GPU was to be subjected to an "indefinite" export licensing requirement. This development had then prompted NVIDIA to announce charges of up to $5.5 billion for its fiscal Q1 2026 (which concluded on the 27th of April), incurred from writing off "inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves" for the H20 GPU. Additionally, NVIDIA completely wrote off its China-origin TAM following the imposition of US licensing requirements on its country-specific H20 GPU, vowing to treat any residual sales in China as an undiscounted windfall instead of a solid figure factored into its guidance. Of course, NVIDIA has been firing on all cylinders even without the Chinese tailwind. For instance, as per a recent assessment by UBS (detailed here), NVIDIA currently has visibility into a whopping $1.5 trillion in data center revenue! This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Coming back, while speaking to reporters in Washington DC, Huang just delivered the following remarks: "General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation." He went on to note: "We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America."

Title: Apple’s C-suite undergoes major reshuffle — here’s what it means for CEO Tim Cook

Apple has quietly undergone a major restructuring of its management team that has sparked speculation about the future of the world’s third most valuable company — but CEO Tim Cook isn’t going anywhere. Even as the iPhone maker faces mounting challenges — from AI stumbles to fading product innovation — the 64-year-old chief executive retains firm control of the company founded by Steve Jobs, even as most of his direct reports are nearing retirement age. And with longtime lieutenant Jeff Williams set to retire later this year, Cook’s leadership appears more entrenched than ever, according to Bloomberg News. Williams, Cook’s most trusted deputy, will exit in December. Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, who is in his late 50s, is slated to assume the COO title. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri has been succeeded by Kevan Parekh, and longtime product executive Dan Riccio departed at the end of last year. The company is seeing its biggest management shake-up in decades. Nearly half of Cook’s approximately 20 direct reports are in their 60s and nearing retirement, including senior figures like marketing chief Greg Joswiak, App Store head Phil Schiller, environment executive Lisa Jackson and chip executive Johny Srouji. Cook, meanwhile, who turns 65 in November, has shown no signs of stepping down or preparing a successor. The departure of Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer and widely seen as Cook’s natural heir, leaves the company without a clear backup plan, Bloomberg News reported. It also reinforces Cook’s position as the indispensable figure guiding Apple through turbulent times. Williams was uniquely positioned as both COO and unofficial backup CEO. Khan, while assuming the title, lacks the breadth of experience and institutional knowledge to immediately step in as chief executive, according to Bloomberg News. The situation is drawing industrywide comparisons to other long-tenured corporate leaders like Disney’s Bob Iger and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, who have extended their influence well past traditional retirement age. For Cook, whose tenure as CEO began in 2011, the prospect of remaining at Apple’s helm for another five years is increasingly likely as there is little urgency from Apple’s board to initiate a transition, Bloomberg News reported. The directors — longtime allies including Arthur Levinson, Susan Wagner and Ronald Sugar — have largely deferred to Cook, who has delivered a staggering 1,500% increase in Apple’s stock price since succeeding Steve Jobs. Though shares are down 16% in 2025, Cook remains the board’s trusted operator during a period of technological and cultural flux. Under his watch, Apple expanded into China, launched successful new product lines like the Apple Watch and AirPods and transitioned into a subscription-driven business. These achievements, however, are being challenged by Apple’s growing design stagnation, lagging AI performance and mounting criticism from developers and regulators. While rivals like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI rolled out advanced AI capabilities early, Apple is seen as trailing far behind. Its flagship initiative, “Apple Intelligence,” launched significantly later than competing products and still lacks several features that were promised during its 2024 debut. Still, there is no indication that the board is losing confidence, according to Bloomberg News. Inside Apple, Services head Eddy Cue has reportedly warned that the company risks becoming “the next BlackBerry or Nokia” if it fails to pivot quickly. Those concerns, coupled with the AI backlash, have prompted a reorganization of the org chart and the beginnings of a strategic reset. In order to right the ship, some have floated acquiring a top-tier AI startup and grooming its CEO for the top job. But insiders dismiss that possibility outright. Apple has reportedly explored acquisitions of companies like Perplexity and is considering Mistral, highlighting its increasing urgency in the AI arms race. The recent loss of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s foundation models chief, to Meta in a deal reportedly worth more than $200 million, only underscores the stakes. Despite the leadership uncertainty, Apple has a slate of new products on the way, including updated iPhones, iPads and a refreshed Vision Pro headset. But the changes are largely incremental — spec bumps rather than groundbreaking innovation, according to Bloomberg News. In the absence of revolutionary hardware or AI breakthroughs, the question of Cook’s eventual exit– and what comes after — continues to loom over Cupertino. For now, however, the CEO remains firmly in charge. And with no clear successor in place, the company’s future is still very much Cook’s to shape. The Post has sought comment from Apple.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury trend-setter, Strategy, has resumed its relentless quest for accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) after a brief pause during the first week of this month. The company added another 4,225 Bitcoins to its treasury in the last week as the price of Bitcoin soared to new all-time highs. Strategy now holds over 600,000 BTC, further solidifying its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), disclosed in a Monday 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had snagged an additional 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin between July 7 and July 14. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC acquired for $42.87 billion at an average price of $71,268 per Bitcoin. At the alpha crypto’s current market price of around $121,795, the company’s BTC stack is valued at over $73 billion. That’s equivalent to nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Strategy has acquired 4,225 BTC for ~$472.5 million at ~$111,827 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.2% YTD 2025. As of 7/13/2025, we hodl 601,550 $BTC acquired for ~$42.87 billion at ~$71,268 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/HhlFIy1m3H The latest acquisition was made using $331 million of net proceeds from sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, under its at-the-market (ATM) program, $71.1 million from STRK preferred shares, $55.3 million from STRF preferred shares, and $15.0 million from STRD preferred shares. These sales collectively yielded $472 million in net proceeds to fund Strategy’s BTC purchase. Strategy’s recent Bitcoin buy comes amid Bitcoin setting a record high above $112,000 last Wednesday. After beginning the week hovering around $108K, the BTC price rocketed to $118,000 highs by July 13. The world’s oldest and largest crypto has continued its parabolic surge today, setting a new all-time high of $122,838, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. As Bitcoin registered its strong upsurge, Saylor has continued voicing his uber-bullish sentiment on the X platform. “It’s going up forever, Laura,” the Strategy co-founder asserted while responding to Unchained’s founder, Laura Shin, who had commented about BTC smashing the $119K mark on Sunday. It's going up forever, Laura. Strategy’s Bitcoin investment comes as a growing number of public companies and other entities have disclosed new Bitcoin acquisitions. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, there are now 141 publicly traded firms that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a bid to emulate Strategy, which started snapping up the asset under the leadership of Michael Saylor back in 2020. Metaplanet, which touts itself as the “Strategy of Japan”, recently raised its Bitcoin stash to 15,555 BTC, worth over $1.7 billion. Semler Scientific, Trump Media, and GameStop are among other companies that have recently announced Bitcoin acquisition plans.

Title: Google Stock To $350?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 10 July 2025, Berlin: The Google logo can be seen on a small door at the stable guard party. Photo: ... More Jens Kalaene/dpa (Photo by Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) Google stock has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $88 levels in early 2023 to approximately $180 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI and cloud computing– the main growth engine for Google. Google Cloud has shown strong performance, with an average revenue growth of 31% over the last three years. This positive trend is anticipated to continue, with sales expected to average over 20% annually for the next three years. The substantial demand for cloud computing services is primarily driven by the growing AI boom, as companies increasingly utilize Google Cloud to quickly implement and scale their AI projects. Additionally, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified Point is, Google has a lot going for it. It also happens to be part of Trefis HQ portfolio strategy that has about 30 stocks. HQ has outperformed S&P and returned >90% since inception. Consider: how much of Google stock is in your retirement portfolio? Talk to an adviser if you’d like to learn about HQ strategy or to see if Google should be part of your portfolio. For Google stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: The convergence of these elements, particularly the AI revolution and growth in cloud computing, opens multiple avenues for Google to meet the performance required to double its stock price over the next 3-5 years. We anticipate Google’s revenues to surpass $500 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double due to improved profitability. Currently, GOOG stock trades around $180, pricing it at roughly 20 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 36 times and Microsoft at 39 times earnings. Given Google’s deep integration of AI and its enhancing profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Alphabet's Valuation Ratios Comparison. Google’s leading position in search, its dominance in digital advertising, and its expanding presence in cloud computing and AI infrastructure offer multiple levers for long-term value creation. This revaluation, supported by accelerating growth in high-margin segments like Google Cloud and YouTube, underpins the potential for the stock to double as markets reassess Alphabet’s earnings potential in an AI-driven economy. Alphabet’s core advertising operations, combined with strategic investments in AI, cloud services, and autonomous technologies, create a well-diversified and resilient growth engine. If these sectors maintain their current trajectory, the stock could see significant upside, driven by both revenue growth and improving operating leverage. While Google’s outlook is promising, several variables could hinder its stock from doubling. Firstly, escalating competition in critical sectors presents a threat. In cloud computing, Google Cloud faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which could pressure its margins and growth rates. Also see – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Likewise, in the rapidly advancing AI sector, rivals such as OpenAI (with ChatGPT) and Perplexity are challenging Google’s dominance in search through AI-driven methods. Secondly, regulatory scrutiny and antitrust actions are considerable concerns. Google is already confronting legal challenges regarding its market dominance in online search and digital advertising. Ongoing probes, including a recent preliminary investigation into its collaboration with Character.AI, underscore a growing regulatory interest in potential anti-competitive behavior, particularly in the emerging AI ecosystem. These developments could restrict expansion, result in hefty fines, or even compel business restructuring. Related – Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit Thirdly, Google’s substantial AI capital expenditures carry execution risks. The company plans to invest around $75 billion in technical infrastructure in 2025 to bolster AI and business growth. If these significant investments do not yield anticipated returns or take excessively long to materialize, investor sentiment may turn unfavorable. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Google’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its search and YouTube platforms, as well as enterprise cloud spending. For more details, see – Buy or Sell GOOG Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like Google less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Investors contemplating Google stock should carefully evaluate these potential risks. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, comprising 30 stocks, has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Most Companies Pick Layoffs. Here’s Why They’re Wrong.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertamatuson/2025/07/14/why-layoffs-are-hurting-companies/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T12:30:00Z

ByRoberta Matuson ByRoberta Matuson, Contributor. The long-term impact of company-wide layoffs Major companies are picking layoffs in the name of efficiency—but is it really making them better? Another day, another layoff announcement. Layoffs are surging across industries, with firms like JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and Amazon making headlines for workforce reductions. Just last month, Microsoft announced plans to cut thousands more employees. Corporate America believes a leaner workforce equals quicker growth, but what are the real consequences? When the economy is in flux, companies tend to take the standard approach of slashing headcount, automating roles, and consolidating team. They do this to achieve immediate cost savings, streamlined operations, and to satisfy their investors. This approach may look good on paper, but is this method effective in the long run? No doubt, a massive layoff can result in dollars being added to the bottom line, but at what cost? Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise: Remember how long it took you to bring new hires up to speed and to train them on your systems? The money and time spent will be gone the moment the laid off employee walks out the door, as will the knowledge. This can severely disrupt operations and hinder innovation. Increased Employee Burnout and Decreased Engagement: Workers are already showing signs of employee burnout. Can you afford to ask your people to do more with less resources? Lower morale leads to reduced engagement, which may very well result in higher voluntary turnover—especially among top performers. Decline in Customer Satisfaction and Damage to Your Brand: Reducing headcount can result in slower service, lower quality, more errors, diminished customer trust, ultimately harming the company’s reputation and bottom line. Is your company brand strong enough to survive dips in quality and unflattering social media posts? Legal and Financial Risks: Layoffs can expose companies to legal challenges, such as wrongful termination claims, and may result in significant severance packages being paid out, along with unexpected legal costs. Do you have enough money in your coffers to budget for this? There are better ways than a layoff to boost efficiency. Here are some effective strategies worth further consideration. Focus on Skills, Not Just Headcount: Examine the skills your staff currently has and redeploy talent rather than cut jobs. Let Non-Performers Go: Terminate them, rather than covering this move up by using a layoff to rid your organization of dead weight. Invest in People: Help them reskill and upskill so they can be more productive for your organization. Offer Flexible Work Arrangements: Some workers may jump at the chance to work a reduced workweek or to job share. Offer Voluntary Buyouts and Early Retirement. Provide incentives for employees to leave voluntarily. Reducing headcount this way will be more favorably perceived by remaining staff than a layoff. Develop New Income Streams: It’s said that necessity is the mother of invention. Look for new opportunities to expand your revenues. Although it may be tempting to follow the latest trend of company-wide layoffs, think twice before taking your next step. By proactively implementing these strategies, organizations can navigate through economic upheaval with minimal disruption to their workforce and emerge stronger for the future.

The 400-foot vessel, currently undergoing outfitting and modification at Bollinger's shipyard in Amelia, Louisiana, is scheduled for delivery in early 2026. The project integrates Rocket Lab's design for advanced rocket recovery, including onboard autonomous ground systems, blast shielding, and station-keeping propulsion to stabilize the vessel during Neutron's sea landings. Neutron's reusability is central to Rocket Lab's mission of scaling launch cadence to meet surging demand across commercial satellite deployments and national security missions. The vessel 'Return On Investment' is expected to operate from the U.S. East Coast, providing rapid return and refurbishment capability for Neutron rockets flying from Wallops Island, Virginia. "Neutron's ability to return to Earth on 'Return On Investment' and launch again and again will be foundational to its success," said Shaun D'Mello, Rocket Lab Vice President - Neutron. "With Bollinger's extensive experience in marine engineering and shipbuilding, they have been selected to deliver this critical project. We're looking forward to working with Bollinger to create the conditions to modernize Louisiana's shipyard capabilities to meet the demands of the aerospace industry's cutting-edge capabilities." Bollinger Shipyards President and CEO Ben Bordelon stated, "Bollinger is proud to partner with Rocket Lab on a project that showcases both the ingenuity and innovation of American shipbuilding and the future of space flight. At Bollinger, we've spent decades building some of the most advanced vessels in the world. We're honored to have been selected to bring our deep expertise and experience in marine engineering and fabrication to a program that pushes the boundaries of what's possible." 'Return On Investment' is a modified barge based on the vessel 'Oceanus', designed to comply with Jones Act regulations and support robust sea-based recovery operations. It will feature thermal protection for electrical systems and custom Rocket Lab equipment to secure and process Neutron rockets post-landing. Neutron, Rocket Lab's next-generation medium-lift vehicle, is engineered for full-stage reuse. Built from carbon composites and powered by nine Archimedes engines generating a combined 1.45 million pounds of thrust, Neutron is capable of delivering 13 tons to orbit and will launch from Wallops Island's Launch Complex 3.

Title: Meta trial becomes test of board culpability over corporate scandals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/14/meta-trial-becomes-test-of-board-culpability-over-corporate-scandals/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:32:36Z
Full Content:
Meta luminaries will publicly testify in a Delaware corporate law court this week over shareholder allegations that board mismanagement was directly responsible for billions in sanctions that the social media group paid over data breaches. Two of Facebook parent company’s best known executives, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, are listed as witnesses in the eight-day trial, which starts on Wednesday. Long-time director and investor Marc Andreessen, as well as former board members Jeff Zients, a former top adviser to former US president Joe Biden, are also set to appear. Other director defendants include the investor Peter Thiel, Kenneth Chenault, the former American Express chief executive and Reed Hastings, the Netflix co-founder. The lawsuit, brought by three tiny minority Meta shareholders, is the first time a complaint over a board’s culpability for a corporate scandal has reached a trial in Delaware, where most such lawsuits are quickly dismissed. In a handful of instances, companies have settled litigation over board oversight charges, most notably the directors of Boeing who agreed to pay $237.5 million (€203 million) over shareholder charges that the highest levels at the aviation titan failed to prevent the 737 Max scandal. In the lawsuit, the shareholders accuse Meta’s directors of knowingly overseeing lax privacy practices, in violation of a 2012 consent decree struck with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) designed to protect users’ personal information – claims that the defendants reject. The FTC later launched an investigation into Facebook’s parent triggered in particular by the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which user data was leaked to a political research group through a third-party app. The suing shareholders have asked for damages stemming from the $5 billion settlement struck with the FTC in 2019 following the investigation. According to the plaintiffs, the board “protected” Zuckerberg by approving the price tag without any internal investigation, in return for the FTC agreeing to drop his name as an individual defendant in the case. Plaintiffs also allege that the founder “unlawfully sold billions of dollars of Meta stock because of the material non-public information (“MNPI”) he had regarding the company’s illicit, undisclosed data sharing practices”. [ Meta wins AI copyright case in blow to authorsOpens in new window ] Meta declined to comment on the case. In court filings, the defendants argue that the social media company’s directors did not knowingly violate the 2012 consent order, and that the board’s decision-making was prudent and not conflicted. Meta faces continued regulatory and legal scrutiny over issues including privacy and antitrust. Critics have argued that its aggressive hunt for growth and profits as a younger company led to online harms, with the company accused of amplifying hate speech and misinformation to juice engagement, or having poor data management practices. More recently, it has poured billions of dollars into trying to become a leader in artificial intelligence. “The allegations are significant in terms of who knew what and when during their largest scandal that they’ve had as a company,” said Jason Kint, a Big Tech critic who leads the Digital Content Next trade group of online publishers. “What’s at stake is the trust of the company – not just for the users but for the shareholders.” Shareholder lawsuits alleging poor board oversight have become known as “Caremark” claims, named for the healthcare company whose shareholders alleged corporate law liability over criminal fraud charges in the 1990s at the healthcare company. [ Meta introduces advertising to WhatsApp in push for new revenuesOpens in new window ] Scholars and judges have long been sceptical that wrongdoing stemming from business operations far removed from the boardroom could be pinned on the offending company’s directors. Directors can also offer a defence that pushing the boundaries of the law is consistent with maximising shareholder value. In the case of Meta, its market capitalisation has soared to nearly $2tn. “Increasingly there is a view that other regulators are not robustly doing their job and only corporate law and securities law can bail out victims,” said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. Meta notes in its court briefs that Delaware judges have previously remarked that a Caremark claim “is possibly the most difficult theory upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment” and that Meta’s “evidence will show that Facebook implemented a robust system of privacy controls” after the 2012 FTC consent decree. [ European Union risks becoming the ‘museum of the world’, says Meta privacy chiefOpens in new window ] The company has, however, already faced setbacks. The core Caremark claim from the plaintiffs has already survived Meta’s motion to dismiss. Separately, the court earlier this year granted sanctions against Sandberg, who left her executive role in 2022 and the Meta board in 2024, for deleting email messages from her Gmail account after being put on notice about the lawsuit. Last week, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said it would move its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, citing “recent actions by the [Delaware] Court of Chancery, which have injected an unprecedented level of subjectivity into judicial decisions, undermining the court’s reputation for unbiased expertise”. The Financial Times has previously reported that Meta has pondered moving its incorporation out of Delaware, the state that has traditionally dominated incorporations by both public and private companies. Technology companies have been spooked by the 2024 decision by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to rescind a $55 billion pay deal that Tesla had previously struck with its chief executive, Elon Musk. That case will soon be heard on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court. Chancellor McCormick is the judge who will now oversee the Facebook trial. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Industrial supplier Fastenal (FAST) posted a solid earnings report early Monday, opening a busy week of earnings set to be dominated by big banks and tech giants like Netflix (NFLX), Fastenal, maker of a variety of fasteners and tools, reported second-quarter revenue of $2.08 billion, along with earnings per share of $0.29, narrowly topping estimates of $2.07 billion and $0.28 per share respectively, per Visible Alpha. Sales and profits rose from the same time a year ago. Shares of Fastenal, which recently underwent a two-for-one stock split and set a record high last week, were up 4% in afternon trading. They entered the day up 20% since the start of this year.a Fastenal effectively kicks off the second-quarter earnings season with its report. Financial-services giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) are all set to report this week. Investors will also get insights into the markets for air travel, streaming, and the health of the American consumer with United Airlines (UAL), Netflix, and PepsiCo (PEP), respectively. Analysts are largely expecting a solid quarter from most of the S&P 500 with earnings expected to grow year-over-year. Others remain more cautious about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and expect executives to provide more clarity on the subject in earnings calls in the coming weeks. Fastenal credited its increasing sales to "improved customer contract signings over the last six quarters," as it added that "market conditions remained sluggish providing minimal contribution."

Title: The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X prices may have leaked — and if true, it's not as bad as I thought
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-prices-may-have-leaked
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:00:48Z
Full Content:
Microsoft and ASUS are gearing up to launch the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld later this year, and the biggest questions remain fixed on price. Do we have our first answer? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few weeks ago, we exclusively leaked the Xbox Ally, codenamed Kennan, in development with ASUS ROG. The Xbox Ally range is powered by Z2 APUs, including the first handheld that will sport the Z2 Extreme on the high-end. These devices will have a heavily customized Windows 11 experience, complete with the first iterations of boot-to-full-screen-app capabilities. The new Xbox app will handle multi-tasking and other system features with an interface more intuitive for controller use, while also likely being the most powerful gaming handheld in existence. Given that last fact, people are expecting the Xbox Ally to also have a powerful price tag. There have already been some rumors about its price range flying around, from anywhere between $800 to over $1000 dollars. A new report from 3DJuegos (via IG) may have given us the first glance, leaked by ASUS itself. And honestly, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Although these prices may still just be place holders or some weird quirk of Google's new AI-"enhanced" search algorithms, Google Search store meta data scraped from ASUS' website, seemingly, suggests that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will closely match their predecessor's retail price, at least in Europe. For comparison, the previous Z1 Extreme ASUS ROG Ally X is currently also €899 in Europe at RRP, although it's currently on sale for $100 off on Amazon Germany. ASUS and other hardware retailers rarely do 1:1 price conversions on devices like this. At the current exchange rate, an €899 euro ASUS ROG Ally X would come in at $1050 US if that were the case. Instead, the ASUS ROG Ally X typically sports a $799 RRP in the United States, although some US retailers like Best Buy have it at $899 right now, likely due to stock limitations. Indeed, purchasing power, VAT, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and other factors go towards deciding the finalized price. Flat currency conversions are not how prices are decided, so take analyses making such claims with a huge pinch of salt. Given the constant evolution of the tariff situations emanating from the United States, you can bet that ASUS and Microsoft could wait until the last minute to finalize the price point. There is an event on the horizon that Microsoft typically prioritizes its PC announcements at, though, in the form of Gamescom in Germany, so it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for a formal announcement there. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Z1 Extreme regular ASUS ROG Ally is on sale for $649 in the United States, which is where these "leaked" prices potentially get a bit more interesting. The regular ASUS ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) is available to buy at around €699 in Europe and $649-ish in the United States, which would put the base model Xbox Ally around €100 cheaper than its higher-end predecessor. This could be a reflection of the power disparity. The lower-end ASUS ROG Ally is listed as $499 on ASUS' website, for reference. The Z2 "A" chip in the base model Xbox Ally is thought to not be as powerful as the Z1 Extreme in the previous ASUS ROG Ally on paper. It's specifically designed to be more cost-effective and potentially more battery efficient. The Xbox Ally X Z2 Extreme will be the crown jewel of gaming handhelds, though, and the price point will reflect that. Model Configuration Price (USD) ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1 / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $499 ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1E / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $649 ASUS ROG Ally X (2024) Z1E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $799 Xbox Ally (2025) Z2A / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $599 (Estimated) Xbox Ally X (2025) Z2E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $899 (Estimated) There has been speculation as to whether or not Microsoft would subsidize these devices, since it will be front-loading its Xbox PC store on them. I'd say that, increasingly, the era of subsidized "console" hardware is going to be a thing of the past, as players increasingly flock to PC and third-party software sales continue to be a smaller part of Microsoft's overall business. The Xbox Ally range are going to be Windows 11 gaming PCs in essence, meaning that you could buy one and never spend a penny on Microsoft's gaming ecosystem. It wouldn't make sense for Microsoft to subsidize it from their perspective. Either way, this could be our first real glimpse at the ASUS Xbox Ally price points. I would expect the United States price points to match the sticker price, rather than do a simple currency conversion. As such, I wouldn't be surprised if the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X come in at around $599 and $899 respectively, if these EU leaked prices are indeed accurate. It would closely match our previous predictions on the Xbox Ally price. But we won't know for sure until ASUS and Microsoft reveal it at their end. Better get saving, either way.

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In May, I reoriented my algorithms to flood me with Canadian content, turned on push notifications from The Globe and Mail, and temporarily moved my family north of the border. For months, Donald Trump had been casually threatening to annex Canada and turn it into a state, adding insult to the injury of the trade war he was waging on the country. One prime minister resigned amid Trump’s bullying, and another was elected because voters thought he could stand up to him. In the ordinarily placid provinces, feelings of bewilderment, anxiety, and offense hardened into a defiant resolve against the United States. “Elbows up,” went the nation’s new hockey-inspired mantra. As a Montreal journalist told me, Americans were preoccupied with “12 different crises.” In Canada, this was the crisis. Anti-American resistance was visible as soon as I landed. At a news kiosk at Toronto Pearson International Airport, the cover of Maclean’s, the de facto national magazine, teased “20 Reasons to Eat Canadian.” Inside was a letter from the editor about canceling a vacation to Cape Cod. This was mild compared with the cover of its next issue, “The New Nationalism,” which contained articles about “Why Canada Will Never Be an American State,” “How to Fight Back Against Trump’s Tariffs,” and “Fear and Loathing in a Canadian Border Town.” The publication had a new promotional campaign: “Canada’s Not for Sale. (But Maclean’s is.)” In grocery stores, Canada-affiliated products had been demarcated with red maple-leaf insignia — an official act of solidarity that complemented the consumer practice of flipping U.S. products upside down to make them easier to avoid. At a Loblaws, a woman wearing a leather jacket and AirPods was inspecting a jar of pomegranate marmalade to verify its country of origin. “I’m so disgusted by what’s going on down there. The most recent Harvard thing?” she said. “I shop on Amazon all the time — I recognize it’s an American company — I switched from buying stuff made in America to buying stuff made in China. And you know what? I’m okay with it.” She suggested I download an app called Maple Scan, which would tell me how Canadian a product was when I took a picture of it. (Canada Dry ginger ale, I learned, is owned by the American conglomerate Keurig Dr Pepper.) The app is just one of a crush of new tools that people up North are using to scrutinize the Canadianness of their purchases. Another one called TheCanadaList.ca was founded by a forensic-psychology professor at Ontario Tech University. He broke down his new habits in a newspaper interview: “I’ve switched from Oreos to Dare or Leclerc, from Nature Valley to MadeGood, from Lay’s to Hardbite, from Oikos to Liberté, from Tostitos to Mad Mexican.” The Buy Canadian phenomenon was even more pronounced on the alcohol front, as the country’s liquor stores are mostly government-run. Ontario Premier Doug Ford — brother of the late Rob Ford, the scandal-plagued Toronto mayor — halted the sale of American products by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, inspiring the other provinces to do the same. I drove to a Toronto LCBO to experience a liquor store with zero bottles of Tito’s Handmade vodka or Josh Cellars Merlot. Taped to the entrance were signs in French and English announcing the removal of U.S. products FOR THE GOOD OF CANADA. I was handed, and asked not to misplace, a laminated list of Canadian alternatives to popular American products. A clerk told me the U.S. booze was in the cellar aging indefinitely. Caught in the crossfire are blameless Canadian products that have an American stigma. For example: White Claw hard seltzer. “White Claw is a Canadian company that made itself huge down South,” Tyler VanderWallen, the general manager of Toronto’s Grizzly Bar, told me (“down South” is the U.S.). “If I sold White Claw here, I’d have to explain that to every third person, and I don’t want to have that fight.” Grizzly Bar is located on Toronto’s nightlife-heavy Queen Street West. A 14-foot inflatable moose guards its front door, and patrons are greeted by a motion-sensor-activated snippet of “O Canada” when they walk through it. The cocktails have names only Canadians understand, like “TVO Kids” and “Hadfield.” Everywhere, there is knowing Canadian kitsch: Canadian-side Niagara Falls projected onto a wall; a Wall of Heroes featuring framed photos of Ryan Reynolds, Leonard Cohen, Shania Twain, Margaret Atwood, Alex Trebek, and 46 others; a map of the key battles of the War of 1812. The bar is owned by a Vancouver video-game designer and his wife, who like to change its theme regularly, “like a piece of code.” When Trump ramped up his attacks, switching to a rabidly pro-Canada décor was the obvious move. The establishment was now under extra pressure to present a wholly Canadian front, from food ingredients to playlists. VanderWallen has started sourcing limes from Mexico instead of the U.S., even though they cost him around 20 cents more apiece. He said he still buys Heinz ketchup “because there’s a Heinz branch in Canada that is promising me I am getting 95 percent Canadian tomatoes.” Other establishments became anti-American against their will. When I visited Badlands, a Toronto bourbon bar that opened three months before all the bourbon disappeared, the manager, Carolina Rodriguez, pointed to a shelf of whiskey bottles she hadn’t intended to stock: Crown Royal (Canadian), Johnnie Walker (Scottish), and Bushmills (Irish). Deprived of the authentic U.S. product, Badlands rebranded as an all-purpose “country” bar. “My favorite cocktail is a Paper Plane, and if you have to make it without bourbon, it is terrible,” Rodriguez confessed to me. When she feels a customer deserves it, she’ll pull from her dwindling stash of pre-Prohibition Jim Beam and make them a proper drink without revealing its key ingredient. The country’s political class has attempted to sever itself from the U.S. by reorienting the Canadian economy in an east-west rather than north-south direction. For example, Canada is knocking down interprovincial trade barriers that make it near impossible to order a bottle of gin from Winnipeg if you live across the country, in say, Halifax. But on an individual level, the most evident rupture has occurred with respect to travel. Southbound commerce and tourism, even to once-symbiotic border destinations, has fallen off a cliff. Horror stories circulating about aggressive U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents don’t help. Buffalo’s new “Buffalo Loves Canada” campaign is trying to entice Canadian visitors by raffling off a $500 gift certificate and by emphasizing its appreciation of Canadian brands. (“Looking at you, Tim Hortons, Swiss Chalet, and Labatt Blue!”) The director of New York’s Thousand Islands tourism bureau stopped showing American images to Canadians on social media “because that allowed for some of that negative sentiment to fester.” The unfavorable exchange rate had already dampened Canadian enthusiasm for the U.S. before Trump smothered it entirely, said Caroline Beteta, the half-Canadian president and CEO of Visit California, the state’s tourism agency. But now warm-weather American states were desperately trying to lure staycationing “snowbirds” back to the sunny regions that rely on their seasonal commerce. “The Canadian media didn’t really want to entertain interviews with us,” Beteta said. She and her team put together an ad spot to highlight connections between the two peoples: the California roll, invented by a chef from British Columbia; Napa’s Signorello Estate, owned by a Canadian. YouTube commenters found it unpersuasive. The snowbird deficit was especially pronounced in Florida, with travelers flocking to the Caribbean instead and Canadian airlines axing direct flights. Governor Ron DeSantis didn’t seem too worried about the 3.3 million Canadians who visited in 2024 not returning, though others in Florida were frantic. “We don’t have any emails; we don’t have any calls,” said Karine Martinez, the Miami-based executive director of the CanadaFlorida Chamber of Commerce. These kinds of casualties are all over the place: In May, Canada’s passport office announced it was cutting 800 jobs because of decreased demand for applications. I spoke to snowbirds who are not just boycotting the beach but have sold second homes. One tech investor who built a house north of Palm Beach a few years ago told me his American golf buddies started making 51st-state jokes: “The first time, it’s funny. The second time, okay. The third time, it’s becoming annoying.” The last straw was a guy in a pickup truck who saw his plates in a parking lot and told him to go back to Canada. This is no way to live, he recalled thinking. Dale Hajas, a retiree from Ontario, recently kissed good-bye to her Greater Tampa development, where she estimates one-fifth of the winter residents are Canadian. “I’ve written to every tourism outlet in the United States — and not very graciously, I swear — to tell them why I will never set foot” there again, she said. “I redacted and then sent out-of-date bank statements showing what we’ve spent in the U.S. over the years.” Edmundston, New Brunswick, sits directly across the border from Madawaska, Maine. Both communities are bilingual, and until this year, their historically Acadian roots bound them more to each other than to their respective nations. Now, Edmundston’s mayor, Eric Marquis, told me border tensions have ruined everything. Residents say they will never return to the U.S., even though everybody has family on both sides and Edmundstoners used to cross over all the time for cheaper gas. “We had to procure two new fire trucks this year,” Marquis said, and this time, they had to be Canadian made. “The first question posed by the city council was ‘Where do they come from?’” The rupture began in earnest last fall. After decades of ho-hum amity that had survived the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in his first term, Trump began to covetously talk about the “faucet” of Canadian river water he wished to divert to California. After the election, then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau traveled to Mar-a-Lago to try to calm Trump’s early trade-related belligerence. The visit backfired when Trump mused about annexation over dinner, then started referring to Trudeau as a mere “governor” on Truth Social. Deeply unpopular even before Trump started messing with him, Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Trump proceeded to air grievances about Canada’s stingy military spending and dairy-production quotas while calling into question the boundaries governing control of the Great Lakes and the 1908 treaty that established the 49th parallel as the border. The administration then applied a round of tariffs to Canada, allegedly to punish it for the fentanyl slipping in from the north. (From 2022 to 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 59 pounds of fentanyl from Canada, compared with 61,900 pounds from Mexico.) Trump’s top brass took up the cause too. FBI director Kash Patel declared on Fox News that 85 percent of “known or suspected” terrorists who entered the country last year came via Canada. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a library that straddles the border, hopping from Quebec to Vermont while chanting “51st state!” Through the early months of the year, the administration continued to threaten, delay, and apply more tariffs while others were struck down in court. Canada is now chiefly being hit with 50 percent duties on steel and aluminum and 25 percent on automobiles, categories from which it had theoretically won exemptions when it signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, a pact Trump called “the best trade deal ever made.” In April, Canada experienced a record trade deficit, driven by a double-digit decline in automobile exports. That month, the central banker and political novice Mark Carney led the underdog Liberals to an upset national victory, which the party owed to the electorate’s view that the once-favored Conservative Party could not credibly stand up to Trump. “Trump is trying to break us so he can own us,” Carney had argued on the campaign trail. Even if most Canadians didn’t deem it likely that Trump would literally invade, there was agreement that he was, for some reason, fixated on crippling them. Carney has since applied counter-tariffs on some $30 billion of U.S. goods, targeting red-state-manufactured products such as bowling balls and bullets. There is only so much pain a country nine times less populous than the United States can inflict, but Canada’s boycotts have started to have their intended effect. Not long after the alcohol ban was imposed, a Kentucky distiller reported he’d already lost $115,000 from canceled shipments to Canada. Every week brings new statistics documenting Canadian retrenchment. Car trips to the U.S.: down 38 percent. Flights: down 24 percent. Canadian web traffic to the home-listings site Redfin: down 26 percent. Thirty-four U.S. states count Canada as their largest export market. “Give us another chance,” said North Dakota Republican Kevin Cramer, when a delegation of U.S. senators visited Ottawa to try and mend relations. In early May, Carney and Trump held a predictably surreal press conference in the Oval Office. Trump began genially, congratulating Carney on his election: “It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine.” But when a reporter asked if he still envisioned Canada as the 51st state, Trump killed the goodwill. “You know, I’m a real-estate developer at heart,” he said. The president waxed poetic about erasing “that artificially drawn line” on the map between the U.S. and Canada, saying that “when you look at that beautiful formation, when it’s together — I’m a very artistic person — but when I looked at that beauty, I said, ‘That’s the way it was meant to be.’” Carney interjected coolly, “Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We’re sitting in one right now.” Trump’s attacks galvanized Canadians because they had thought of their relationship with the U.S. as fraternal; the two countries share a language, cultural idioms, an undefended 5,525-mile border. When the Canadian journalist Paul Wells reluctantly severed his ties with the States this year, he wrote that it felt like an “amputation.” Yet the result of Canada’s withdrawal has been not just a mass “freedom fries” moment but a quest to redefine a national ethos distinct from American influence. Ten years ago, Trudeau told the New York Times his country had “no core identity” and had proudly set aside its cultural divisions to become “the first post-national state.” Now, Trump has given Trudeau’s own listless party an opening to reclaim a sense of patriotism, making Conservative pols feel like the victims of a stolen-valor campaign but uniting most everyone else around an invigorating shared project. When Scarborough, Ontario, native Mike Myers brandished a CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE T-shirt and mouthed “Elbows up” on Saturday Night Live — the phrase is associated with Red Wings legend Gordie Howe — he gave a name to the movement sweeping the country. In an ad spot for his bid for prime minister, Carney grilled Myers, a U.S. resident, to make sure he had retained his Canadian in-knowledge. (Carney: “What are the two seasons in Toronto?” Myers: “Winter and construction.”) Celebrity affiliation cuts the other way, too. In June, Jagmeet Singh, the former leader of the progressive New Democratic Party, was spotted attending a Kendrick Lamar concert, which was arguably disloyal to Lamar’s rival, Drake, even in peacetime. The Toronto rapper called him out, and Singh groveled for forgiveness, claiming he had been there only to see the other headliner, SZA. Also, wine from the estate that produces Wayne Gretzky’s line has become an exception to the Buy Canadian rule. Once a national hero, Gretzky is now persona non grata for his friendship with Trump. A guy offering tastings at a kiosk told me he places Gretzky’s wine as far from the customer eyeline as possible. One of the surest signs of the national mood shift is that even in Quebec, the independence-minded, Anglo-skeptical electorate is reporting unprecedented surges of Canadian patriotism. The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, has dismissed the rest of Canada as “an artificial country.” Yet many Québécois have swung toward the Liberals as a bulwark against Trump, and Blanchet understands the need to ally with them too. “This truce will last as long as we face the challenge imposed by Trump,” he told Maclean’s. Even the most anti-Canada Canadians I met couldn’t work themselves up for annexation. In Ottawa, I met Nicholas Ewanchuk outside the Canadian Parliament; he was flying a Trump flag, an American flag superimposed with an 18-wheeler, and an upside-down Canadian flag — the latter two symbols of the trucker convoy that blockaded Ottawa in 2022 in protest of COVID-19 restrictions. A Saskatchewan trucker fired for noncompliance, Ewanchuk had been protesting in Ottawa ever since. I asked if he was interested in joining the U.S. He winced, parrying the question. “You know, there never used to be a border. Back in the day, it was called Turtle Island,” he said, using an Indigenous term for the North American landmass. Canadian Star Trek legend William Shatner has been publicly workshopping a counterproposal to the U.S., summoning his Captain Kirk persona to engage in freelance diplomacy. “Canadians are very aware of the ka-ra-te adage ‘Use the opponent’s weight against them,’” Shatner told me from Los Angeles. “Canada should say to President Trump, ‘You are the head of a rambunctious country, very difficult to govern at this point. We can ease your pain. Canada is calm, settled, successful. Clean air, clean water, pleasant people. Why don’t you become the 11th province?’” Two days after I arrived in Canada, I caught a plane to Ottawa to get a glimpse of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Charles had come to the capital to deliver a highly anticipated address to the Canadian Parliament called a “Speech From the Throne,” the climax of a pomp-filled 24-hour visit plotted by the new prime minister as a symbolic rebuke to Trump. In the hours leading up to the speech, I followed the royals to events designed to showcase Canada’s heritage and natural bounty: a puck drop at a youth hockey game, a farmers’ market, a tree planting, a military parade, all of them thronged with people in maple-leaf and Union Jack gear. Rolling out the red carpet for one’s old colonial master may not seem like an obvious demonstration of national sovereignty, but it made sense in Canada: Since Trump has a thing for the royals, it was a flex that the nation, as a member of the Commonwealth, could summon its king on short notice, especially as Charles was undergoing treatments for cancer. Amid Trump’s confusing aggression, the visit would also underscore the country’s secure place in a wider global dominion. And contrary to the idea that the two nations were intuitively mergeable, a choreographed regal affair might accentuate certain proudly un-American aspects of Canada’s national character, such as the “peace, order, and good government” enshrined in its constitution. In the capital, the royal visit was treated as a national holiday. Even its most benign details were curated, or at least interpreted, to reflect the hostile new dynamic between Canada and its longtime ally to the south. On previous visits, for example, Charles had been chauffeured in an American-made Lincoln. This time, he rode in a BMW. A royal historian named Justin Vovk insisted to the CBC that even Charles’s planting of a single tree would “take on added symbolism,” given Trump’s rhetoric about Canada’s natural resources. Waiting for the royals to show up at the farmers’ market, I chatted up well-wishers pressed against a security perimeter. A woman named Lucia Velasco told me she saw Charles as a stabilizing force in wartime. “And right now we are not at war, but …,” she said, trailing off. Debbie Guiry, standing nearby and wearing a Union Jack umbrella hat, finished the thought: “It feels like it.” The night before the “Speech From the Throne,” I met Liam Mooney at the Rideau Club, an elite gathering spot established by two of Canada’s founding fathers. Mooney, who runs an Ottawa branding agency with his wife, created the now-famous CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE cap worn by Premier Ford, which has sold more than 50,000 units and inspired many knockoffs. A little sheepishly, Mooney told me, he has cried at just two celebrity deaths — those of NFL broadcaster John Madden and Queen Elizabeth II. In other words, some part of him could easily have been American, but another was not. In January, after Trudeau announced his resignation, Mooney said, “We had this weird problem where Canada doesn’t have a dad.” Today, he said, half-joking, “Granddad is here.” Over my weeks in Canada, I encountered a number of attempts to retrofit a cohesive identity onto a nation that can seem best defined by its agreeable pastiche of other nations’ influences. “Talking about the Canadian border or the 49th parallel like it’s an imaginary thing — it forces you to think, like, Okay, well, what is it that we’re about?” Mooney said. “Well, Canada’s bilingual. We are a peacekeeping nation. We are a winter nation. When it’s 30 below Celsius, you better have a good relationship with your neighbor” because it’s too cold to head into town for milk. Mooney repeated an adage I heard a lot: The country is a mosaic of peoples, rather than an assimilated, American-style melting pot. “We are a parliamentary democracy,” he said. “We were founded by these two crowns, the British and the French.” A Euro-style social democracy built on a foundation of Tory mildness, Canada can feel lab-designed for compromise and geniality. In The Globe and Mail, a writer described the nation as one of “satirists and folk singers, sage retired bureaucrats, and many, many farmers.” In Maclean’s, another writer compared Canada’s “long but imperfect history of muddling along peaceably” with America’s “unpredictable and increasingly dysfunctional empire.” All of which makes the new Canadian nationalism so striking. Despite Trump’s instigation of the conflict, there is an oddly abstract quality to U.S. bellicosity; even the president’s most loyal supporters may be only vaguely aware that the relationship with the country’s close trading partner and military ally has completely ruptured. Whereas in Canada, where nobody had a problem in the first place, virtually the entire population is now charged up and doing bespoke economic protectionism. “In the U.S., there’s roughly 350 million people going on their way, la-di-da,” said Ford, the Ontario premier. “But there’s 41 million Canadians at a fever pitch right now doing everything they possibly can to support the cause. I’ve never seen patriotism like this.” The “Speech From the Throne” took place at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday. Normally a rote address used to open a new session of Parliament, the actual sovereign had only twice appeared in person to deliver it. And while the speech was written by the prime minister’s staff, even the subtlest anti-Trump jab ventriloquized by the monarch would be newsworthy. The country’s political class showed up in full, including vanquished Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. First Nations leaders from the prairie provinces arrived in traditional headdresses, and Trudeau caused a fuss by wearing turquoise-and-orange Adidas Gazelles with his suit. The king began by acknowledging the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people, then delivered his speech in French and English, alternating every few paragraphs. “When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,” read Charles in his familiar murmur. Sitting beside him was Camilla, wearing a maple-leaf brooch. Now, he continued, “Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.” The king spoke of self-determination and the rule of law and trade, rendering the target of his speech unmistakable. His closing line generated a rousing ovation: “As the anthem reminds us, the True North is indeed strong and free.” If the goal was to get Trump’s attention, it appeared to work. Later that day, he posted on Truth Social, “I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!” In my travels, I met a retired high-school history teacher named Peter Kear who loaned me his copy of a 1993 book called The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Canadian Resistance to American Expansionism. As an American typically unversed in Canadian history, I wondered if its title was maybe a bit hyperbolic. Then I opened the book to example after footnoted example of zealous American attempts to dominate Canada. “Come then, ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty,” General George Washington wrote to the Canadians in September 1775, announcing he had authorized a military invasion “not to plunder, but to protect you.” The British Empire had recently conquered Quebec and the rest of New France from Louis XV, and the Americans were trying to enlist the colony in their brewing revolution. Their entreaties failed, in part because of Britain’s shrewd passage of the 1774 Quebec Act, which allowed the province to maintain its Catholic religion. Washington launched a New Year’s Eve invasion of Quebec City that ended in miserable defeat and the capture of 372 of Colonel Benedict Arnold’s 500 troops. America was undeterred. “The unanimous voice of the Continent is that Canada must be ours,” insisted John Adams, then a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. In the winter of 1776, Benjamin Franklin was sent north on a diplomatic mission to tout the U.S. cause, which also failed. After the Americans won the Revolutionary War, tens of thousands of Tory “United Empire Loyalists” fled to Canada, massively increasing its English-speaking population and arguably seeding the temperamental divide between tranquil Canada and its more ardent neighbor to the south. In 1812, President James Madison declared war and invaded Canada again; Speaker of the House Henry Clay said, “I would take the whole continent from them.” (The war is generally considered a draw, but I was made to understand that British Canada and its Shawnee allies should be seen as the victors because the invading Americans gained no territory while their opponents burned down the White House.) In 1844, James K. Polk won the presidency on the strength of the “54-40 or Fight” campaign to claim northwestern land clear to Alaska, up through present-day British Columbia. From the Canadian perspective, the movement to confederate the country’s provinces into a single nation was driven partly by the need to resist American expansion, which Canadians feared would spread northward after the military buildup of the Civil War. “They coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted Louisiana, and they purchased it; they coveted Texas, and stole it,” said Thomas D’Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation who had moved from the U.S. to escape its “diseased love of excitement.” McGee was allegedly murdered by a member of an Irish separatist group that attacked Canada with the possible blessing of President Andrew Johnson. Even after Britain granted Canada the right to self-governance, in 1867, the U.S. continued to wage economic warfare in an attempt to bring the young country to its knees. In 1888, Secretary of State James Blaine wrote that, like a ripe apple, Canada would “fall into our hands” and “seek admission to the Union” if the U.S. bludgeoned it with the heavy import duties that became known as the McKinley -Tariff, named for Trump’s favorite protectionist. (There have also been Canadian pro-annexationists, including the composer of “O Canada,” of all people, who in the 1880s became embittered with his country and moved to Massachusetts.) Relations improved vastly in the 20th century, but even in the 1980s, vestigial anxiety about American imperialism was such that many felt free trade, not protectionism, was the thing that would finally KO Canada’s sovereignty. The 1988 Liberal Party leader John Turner argued the trade pact that preceded NAFTA would reduce the country “to a colony of the United States” dependent on the impulses of its corporations. Turner lost that year’s election, but a million more Canadians voted for the anti-free-trade candidates than against them. (The author of my talismanic new history book, David Orchard, was one of the leaders of the movement.) So a student of Canadian history might not have been surprised at a renewed bout of U.S. encroachment, nor the Canadian response to it. “The U.S. always seems to think, If we can threaten you economically, you’ll just come and join us,” says Christopher Sands, an expert on U.S.-Canada relations. Sands used to direct the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, until, tellingly, the Wilson Center was dismantled by DOGE. “It has never worked. It only ever builds up a certain Canadian nationalistic response,” he said. Of course, not every single last Canadian is living life at a nonstop anti-U.S. fever pitch. Though nobody wants to be annexed, there tends to be an older-white-liberal bent to the most fervent of the new patriots, as at a “No Kings” rally. The cause may feel less urgent for oil-and-gas libertarians in Alberta, which is home to a growing separatist movement, or in the immigrant enclaves of the Toronto suburbs that voted Conservative in the recent election, where people were focused on housing costs and quality-of-life issues. Some demographics are bound to find the rah-rah a little embarrassing. “Elbows up, or whatever,” wrote Slate’s Toronto-based music critic Carl Wilson on his Substack, recommending some Canadian LPs for Canada Day. Others are fully catastrophizing. This past spring, Canadian author Stephen Marche war-gamed a potential conflict in The Atlantic. Given the large discrepancy in the size of the countries’ standing armies, he figured the Canadian military response would have to include civilian insurgency. “If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers,” he wrote, citing a combat expert. “Canadians cannot afford complacency.” Marche has an eight-part podcast out on the U.S. threat featuring an image of geese and eagles fighting. The plot of Michael Moore’s 1995 movie Canadian Bacon is that a U.S. president gins up anti-Canadian hate to boost his approval rating, the running joke being, Who could possibly hate a Canadian? In South Park, Canadians are depicted as a malign, weird-looking species, and the townspeople hold them responsible for corrupting the youth. What pop culture treats as prima facie farcical, Trump is doing in real life: blaming Canada. His exact motivation remains opaque. Trade tensions flared in his first term, but there was no talk of water faucets and 51st states. Some theorize Trump enjoys trolling Trudeau and, even after his resignation, just never stopped. “He always saw Trudeau as a theater major,” said someone involved in the trade negotiations. Not all of Trump’s complaints are random. His grievances with Quebec’s protectionist dairy industry, which limits imports, were shared by the Biden administration. (Milk is the third rail of Canadian politics. Carney has already pledged not to touch it in trade negotiations, lest he lose Quebec’s support.) And especially now, you can find Canadians who agree with Trump that the country should ramp up its military-defense budget to meet NATO spending obligations, as Carney has pledged to do. When it comes to the president’s outré talking points, such as the location of the 49th parallel, observers of the conflict -suspect trade hawk and White House senior counselor Peter Navarro may be in his ear. In 2018, Navarro said there was a “special place in hell” for Trudeau during routine trade talks. This year, he reportedly proposed ejecting Canada from the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. (He denied the report.) When I texted Steve Bannon to ask what he thought of the new hostilities toward Canada, he replied, “LOVE IT.” But then, just a few months ago, Bannon struck a different tone in an interview with the Financial Times. “Canada punches way above their weight. If you look at military history, they’ve been the best ally we’ve had,” he said. Bannon didn’t pick up the phone when I tried to square the circle. “I’m not sure this has an intellectual underpinning, to be honest,” a former Trump-administration foreign-policy official told me. The tariffs themselves, should they stick, are likely to have mixed results. Canadians do fear they could decimate the auto industry. “We don’t really want cars from Canada,” Trump explained to Carney in May. “And at a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars.” That same month, General Motors announced it was eliminating a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant that makes Chevrolet Silverados, resulting in roughly 650 layoffs that will take place in the fall; GM is ramping up Silverado production in Indiana. But Canada’s inclusion in Trump’s aluminum tariffs has also generated puzzlement. The U.S. gets two-thirds of its aluminum from Canada, but those smelters are mostly powered by cheap Quebec hydroelectricity the U.S. probably can’t replicate. Sylvain Maltais, the head of the aluminum-workers union in the company town of Alma, told me that there had been no layoffs and that Rio Tinto, the mining giant that owns the plants, was proceeding with existing investments. “For the moment, it’s going well. There’s not a lot of stress,” Maltais said. In the U.S., however, the prices of seltzer and cat food — and anything else that comes in a can — are expected to rise. Even if a truce is reached to end the trade war, the national resistance against America will persist. As Trump continues to belittle and toy with Canada, its people have lost faith that its neighbor will treat it decently. At the start of the conflict, commenters tended to lump Trump’s attacks on Canada as of a piece with his designs on Greenland and the Panama Canal, all of it evidence of cartoonish saber-rattling. But as the rift deepened, Canadians began taking the imperialist threat seriously. Surveying the growing imbalance between the temperate Canadian climate and drought-stricken areas of the American West, an environmental journalist recently forecast, in the magazine The Walrus, a future in which Canada becomes a strip-mined “vassal state”: “As US aquifers go dry, the lakes will be a natural place to look.” On June 15, Trump arrived in Carney’s home province of Alberta for the Group of Seven Summit, where the Canadian media and political Establishment were cautiously optimistic that the conference might produce a new trade agreement. Would the countries patch things up? Instead, in a press conference, Trump blamed Barack Obama and Trudeau (who wasn’t in power at the time) for kicking Russia out of the then-G8 for its 2014 invasion of Crimea. Trump abruptly left the next day without any progress made on a deal, and Canadians felt had all over again. In July, seemingly out of the blue, Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on all Canadian goods, posting an open letter to Carney on social media in which he complained that Canada had “financially retaliated” against the U.S. and doubled down on the assertion that Canada fails “to stop the drugs from pouring” across the border. Carney responded on X: “We are committed to continuing to work with the United States.” But, he added, “we are building Canada strong” and “strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world.” Until his retirement from Parliament earlier this year, Charlie Angus represented a large swath of rural Ontario. A rabble-rouser who plays in an alt-country band called the Grievous Angels, Angus has remade himself as a de facto leader of the “Elbows up” movement, posting testimonials of everyday resistance on Substack and touring auditoriums across the country. The night after Trump’s G7 exit, I went to one of his events in Oshawa, the economically anxious General Motors town. Filling the theater was a mostly older crowd with a few union types mixed in. Angus launched heatedly into his one-man show. “They thought, Canada, wow, let’s go pick on the Canadians, right? I mean, what’s easier to pick on than Canadians? That’s what they thought. They thought we were pushovers. Now they’re learning,” he said. It used to be “we didn’t need a big national story. We didn’t need to be jingoistic because we had next-door neighbors who were super-loud. We just did our thing. And then suddenly, we have a government who says we don’t even have a right to exist as a nation. Overnight, something changed for every person in this country. You said, ‘Not on my watch,’ and you sat down at the kitchen table and said, ‘No, we’re not going back to Florida.’ And you called the hotel in Arizona and said, ‘I don’t care if we lose our deposit.’” If all this sounded like a civilized way to conduct a trade war, well, that only underscored the rift. It takes a special kind of belligerence to piss off the nicest people on the planet. With friends like us, who needs enemies? And if our enemies now include Canada, we probably don’t have any friends left at all. A couple of weeks before the show, Angus and I had met in Toronto at Grizzly Bar. “You think I’m going to let that fucking criminal take my country? Not a chance,” he said as we drank Canadian beers. “So suddenly we go from being really easygoing to a nation of hockey goons.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: 5 Challenges Facing New WPP CEO Cindy Rose
URL: https://www.adweek.com/agencies/5-challenges-facing-new-wpp-ceo-cindy-rose/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Incoming WPP CEO Cindy Rose has a big job ahead when she steps into the role in September. As the Microsoft exec takes the reins from Mark Read, who’s departing after seven years at the helm, she inherits a business in decline that’s struggling to keep pace with an industry in flux. In addition to addressing WPP’s structural and financial problems—it issued a shock profit warning and downgraded its 2025 growth forecast last week—Rose must stave off continued client losses and turn around morale at its agencies. Industry leaders agree that Rose has the AI and technology expertise needed to bring WPP into the future. But what’s most crucial is that she develops a clear vision for a business that’s lacked one for some time. “Hopefully the WPP board are clear about what its new strategy is, as the current one has not delivered,” said Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Studio.One and former CEO of WPP agency AKQA. As the leader of a public company, Rose will have to contend with shareholders impatient for WPP’s stock to bounce back from historic lows. This will be difficult in a sector that is “facing real pressure,” said Ahmed. “Interest rates are still high. Budgets are tight. Platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Google offer increasingly sophisticated ad tools that bypass agencies,” he said. “Consulting firms and independent agencies are winning share with a more attractive value proposition.” In that pressure cooker, Rose’s strategic decisions will, in large part, be dictated by the board’s end game: Does it want to create a real strategy for WPP’s future, or would it be better off selling the company for parts? “There’s the financial engineering side—what will produce the most value for shareholders independent of the right strategy?” said Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall. “Because the stock is so, so very low, it could very well be that the board would rather see some immediate benefits.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of S4 Capital and former CEO of WPP for three decades, said it comes down to whether the business “would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.” “Companies that were once part of WPP, such as Kantar, VCCP, FGS, and Globant have thrived as independent companies,” Ahmed pointed out. “The question is, could WPP realize the value in some of its assets before it’s too late, or does it want to merge and consolidate its agencies further internally?” If the board does want to pursue a future for WPP in this current state, Rose needs a clear strategy and point of view for the business—something observers agree has been lacking. “The big concern for shareholders and employees isn’t just the structure; it’s the absence of a clear, credible plan,” Ahmed said. “For a while now, it’s felt like WPP has been making it up as it goes along.” For Wieser, that challenge gets to the heart of an existential industry issue: “how do you organize a modern agency group, and what should the agency services industry look like?” While Read merged agencies under WPP to streamline its unwieldy operations, he hasn’t gone as far as his peers in operating the company as a single brand. Instead, he’s touted the importance of agency brands as levers for attracting clients and talent, Wieser said. But that approach has drawbacks for WPP, including adding “layers of non-billable overhead both at the central level and within the agencies,” as well as “tremendous duplication of services,” Ahmed said. “Ogilvy has become a holding company within a holding company, which isn’t exactly simplification.” Wieser agreed that agency mergers weren’t a real strategy. “That was desperation,” he said. “There’s a recognition these will be loss-making entities on their own, so let’s do the bare minimum.” Coming in as an industry outsider, Rose will have to quickly develop a point of view on the role of agency brands and identify the right structure to take WPP into the future. “Being both a holding company and a client-facing brand at the same time as managing dozens of agency brands with their individual cultures, leadership teams, and operations is confusing, and this model hasn’t worked for WPP,” Ahmed said. Under Read, WPP invested millions of dollars into WPP Open, its internal AI platform. It will be Rose’s job to make that bet pay off—and set WPP up for an AI-powered future. “The significant investment into WPP Open hasn’t yielded the growth that was hyped a couple of years ago,” Ahmed said. According to Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester, WPP chose a tech executive with an AI background for exactly that reason: “The selection of Rose is designed, in part, to further commercialize WPP Open,” he said. Ahmed agreed that Rose’s experience at Microsoft, which “hasn’t exactly been shy about reinventing themselves over the years,” will be useful in pushing WPP to adapt to automation. But whether that’s enough to transform the legacy holding company’s business model remains to be seen. “WPP is a services company, not a software company,” Pattisall agreed. “Modernizing WPP itself, as it reconciles with automation and change, will be no small task.” “I’m not convinced that agencies can build a SaaS-type business in competition with software companies like Adobe,” Sorrell added. Rose is taking over a business where morale is low and client relationships are tenuous. WPP has lost several major clients this year, including Mars and Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, ongoing layoffs and a botched return-to-work mandate have led to discontent and anxiety among staff. Sorrell pointed to what he views as a misguided simplification strategy under Read, which collapsed brands like J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, and Wunderman, as the reason WPP has lost “not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.” Nick Emery, CEO of agency Jellyfish and a former WPP Media exec, believes Rose’s biggest challenge will be to “fight for, protect, and champion the many brilliant people who’ve given their all to the company—and to craft a strategy that makes them happier, drives growth for clients, and fully embraces the role of AI to fulfill the promise of technology.” Rose’s attention here must be “24/7, laser-focused on the USA,” according to Sorrell, which is “undoubtedly the center of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralized.” “You have to hope—if you’re hoping for good things for WPP—that she’s an excellent manager,” Wieser added. “That’s probably the single most important issue.” Rose’s industry outsider status could be a challenge or benefit, depending who you ask. Ahmed described her as “a safe pair of hands” as “an internal candidate with an external vantage point.” Sorrell said she fits WPP board chairman Philip Jansen’s criteria as a technology and AI-forward executive. But Wieser pointed out that in addition to this being her first CEO gig, her only ad industry experience has been through the vantage point of sitting on WPP’s board. “You really haven’t actually lived and breathed the industry,” he said of Rose. “It’s plausible that your views on the industry might be incomplete.” However, he added, “it can also mean fresh eyes, which is not a bad thing at all,” pointing to Michael Roth’s successful tenure at IPG. What’s crucial is that Rose surrounds herself with executives that have “clarity of vision.” “It’s going to come down to good management,” he said.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as king of market milestones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/07/14/nvidia-dethrones-apple-as-king-of-market-milestones/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T04:02:00Z

Nvidia is the world’s first $4 trillion company, leaving Apple – long the king of market milestones – in its wake. Apple was the first to hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion. But while its market capitalisation ($3.15 trillion) has idled since first closing above that landmark in mid-2023, Nvidia’s has quadrupled, fuelled by insatiable demand for its AI chips. Even that understates Nvidia’s rise: the stock is up more than 1,000 per cent since early 2023. [ Nvidia outpaces Microsoft and Apple on path to $4 trillion valuationOpens in new window ] That sounds bubbly, but staggering revenue growth suggests otherwise. Revenues rose 69 per cent last quarter to $44 billion, with another record forecast for this one. Its top customers – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet – are to spend $350 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of it on Nvidia hardware. Valuation remains punchy, but not absurd. Nvidia’s price-sales ratio is nearly four times that of Apple’s, but the difference between their forward price-earnings ratios is slight. Nvidia bulls will note its growth rate is exponentially higher than Apple’s and its PEG ratio (which adjusts for earnings growth) is actually far lower. Apple is stable and cash-rich, but slow growth means it’s far from cheap. Nvidia appears riskier, but it keeps growing into its multiple. For now at least, investors are willing to pay up for speed over stability.

Rupee falls below 86 against USD due to foreign fund outflows and trade deal delay, impacted by global factors. Today, the Indian stock market closed in negative territory with the Nifty 50 ending at 25,082.45, down approximately 67 points or 0.27%, and the Sensex falling over 247 points. The decline was primarily driven by broad-based selling pressure in the IT sector, which acted as the key laggard. Major IT stocks such as Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) witnessed average declines of 1.5%, with TCS’s subdued quarterly earnings and cautious outlook weighing heavily on sentiment. Global cues also remained weak, with concerns over the ongoing trade war and anticipation of US inflation data contributing to cautious investor behavior. Despite the negative close, some pockets such as select banking and pharmaceutical stocks showed resilience, but their gains were insufficient to offset the broad market weakness. The market breadth was skewed towards declines, reflecting a risk-off sentiment among investors amid mixed earnings results and geopolitical uncertainties. Tara Chand InfraLogistic Solutions has been awarded a new contract by Steel Authority of India Ltd for Appointment as the Consignment and Handling Agent at SAIL’s largest warehouse by volume i.e. Dankuni Warehouse in West Bengal. Siemens Energy India posted a net profit of ₹246.1 crore for the quarter ended March 2025 as against ₹180.5 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

The total turnover of trade has crossed 87.36 crore, with the volume-weighted average price recorded at ₹4,368/MWh. The first trade opened at ₹4,430/MWh, and as of the reporting time, the price is trending around ₹4,364/MWh, reflecting healthy participation across participants including power generators, discoms, large industrial consumers, and market intermediaries. This launch provides a transparent, risk-managed platform for participants to hedge electricity price volatility, support long-term power planning, and contribute to India’s broader energy transition goals.

Smartworks Coworking Spaces’ ₹756.57 crore initial public offering (IPO) closed today with an overall subscription of 4.09 times, indicating a moderately strong to hot investor response, driven by robust demand across institutional and high-net-worth investor segments. The Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) portion was subscribed 4.34 times, while the Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs)—primarily comprising High Net-Worth Individuals—subscribed a significant 7.91 times, with Big NIIs (bids over ₹10 lakh) leading the charge at 8.85 times. The retail investor category saw a healthy subscription of 2.36 times, indicating steady interest from individual investors. The employee quota was also fully subscribed at 1.95 times. The IPO attracted 2.8 lakh applications in total. While Day 1 saw a relatively lukewarm start, demand picked up strongly on the final day, especially from institutional investors, suggesting growing confidence in the company’s fundamentals and long-term prospects. The strong traction from institutional and affluent investor segments positions the Smartworks IPO in the ‘Hot’ response category by market standards, particularly for a new-age commercial real estate player operating in the managed office space segment. SIS Ltd board approved an investment of upto INR 8 crores in Installco Wify Technology Private Limited (“Wify”) by way of subscription to Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares for the acquisition of approximately 4.56% equity stake The cooling-down of WPI to a 20-month-low is a welcome news for every sector and business. With the decline in inflation on food items being the major influence in this trend is a positive sign, especially for the household consumers and food services sector. The deflated trend observed in food items, along with other factors including the CPI performance, and the recent rate cut by the MPC has enhanced liquidity flow in the hands of the masses, thereby boosting domestic consumption, and empowering the businesses in the food services sector with some relief on the margins. We foresee this performance to sustain over a period of time, driven by cautious-but-steady steps of the RBI to keep the inflation within the desired range. Having said that, there is a need to be agile and stay vigilant on the global economic and commodity trends to ensure the ripple effect of the same doesn’t hamper the domestic momentum. Karnataka Bank appoints Raghavendra Srinivas Bhat as Managing Director and CEO, highlighting his 38-year career and leadership qualities. Markets remained under pressure during midday trading on Monday, with the Sensex down 365.29 points to 82,135.18 and the Nifty declining 101.55 points to 25,048.30 as of 12.31 PM. The benchmark indices extended their morning losses amid continued concerns over potential US tariffs on India and persistent weakness in information technology stocks.

The domestic market tanked on Monday driven by weak corporate results, global trade fears and foreign fund outflows. Stock market plunges on weak corporate results and global trade fears, with Nifty IT down 1.54% and smallcaps outperforming. “The WPI surprisingly reverted to a year-on-year (YoY) deflation in June 2025 after a gap of 19 months, printing at -0.1% as against ICRA’s expectation of +0.8% for the month. This was largely led by prices of food items, which declined by 0.3% after witnessing an inflation of 1.7% in the previous month, amid softer prints for fruits and vegetables, pulses, cereals, spices, and edible oils. Among the non-food items, the deflation in fuel and power also widened between these months, exerting downward pressure on the headline print. Notably, the core WPI (non-food manufactured items) inflation inched up marginally to +1.0% in June 2025 from +0.9% in May 2025, while remaining subdued. The seasonal sequential uptick in food prices has been relatively modest in July 2025 so far, which is expected to keep food print in the deflationary zone, unless there is an unusual surge in such prices in the remaining part of the month, especially for vegetables. Besides, international crude oil prices have also eased somewhat in the ongoing month from the peak seen in June 2025, amid cooling tensions in West Asia, while remaining in the deflationary territory on a YoY basis. Further, the USD/INR pair has also remained range bound so far. Overall, ICRA expects the headline WPI to remain in the deflationary territory in July 2025 despite an unfavourable base, amid the sustained YoY deflation in food and crude oil prices. With the WPI inflation averaging at just 0.4% in Offers investors a unique opportunity to build long-term wealth Fund available at ₹10 Net Asset Value (NAV) during the New Fund Offer (NFO) subscription period commencing from July 14 Becomes the first life insurer to offer this fund to its customers As investors prepared for US trade-related developments, markets took a cautious approach last week. Following a brief decline below $3300, gold has recovered, and Silver has touched new record highs. Trump said on Tuesday that copper would probably be subject to a 50% tariff. Trump then reaffirmed his warning on Wednesday to impose additional tariffs on BRICS nations and released a fresh series of letters outlining duty rates of 20%–30% on smaller trading partners like the Philippines, Algeria, and Libya. In the meantime, the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting revealed that the majority of members projected a rate reduction later this year, with any tariff-related price increase being “temporary or modest.” Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced that an additional 10% tariffs would be applied to nations that align with the BRICS group, an intergovernmental organization made up of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa (founding members), India, China, Brazil, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Trump imposed a 30% tariff on both the EU and Mexico in letters to both countries, calling their trade deficits with the US a “major threat” to national security. Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1. Trump did, however, publish the letters they addressed to trading partners, revealing that they will be levying 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan. For more precise clues about the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, investors are keenly observing a number of important US economic releases this week, such as the CPI, PPI, retail sales, and industrial production.

Gold is on the verge of giving a breakout above $3370 (~Rs 98000), the next target is $3415 (~Rs 99000) and $3450 (~Rs 100,000). Silver prices have given an upside breakout of their range above $37.5 (~Rs 110,000). This bullish momentum is expected to extend further towards $40 (~Rs 115,000) and $41 (~Rs 118,000). Agri-gold lending guidelines revised RBI allowed voluntary pledge of gold and silver as collateral This is positive for PSU banks that rely on PSL certificate fee income Among PSU Banks, Union Bank, Canara Bank and Indian Bank have higher share of fee income from this business Bitcoin has rocketed to a fresh all-time high, surging past $121,000. Here’s the take of Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ, on this development: Bitcoin has smashed past $121,000, marking fresh all-time highs as institutional demand and policy tailwinds fuel the rally. The latest surge follows last week’s 10% rise, with over $289 million in short liquidations amplifying momentum. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.2 billion in inflows on Thursday and $1.03 billion Friday, pushing total U.S. ETF net inflows beyond $50 billion to date. The rally coincides with Congress’ “Crypto Week,” where lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and GENIUS Act, aiming to establish regulatory clarity and permanently block CBDCs. With Trump’s pro-crypto policies, regulatory easing, and macro uncertainty, Bitcoin’s case as a mainstream asset is rapidly solidifying. Of a total of 4,135 stocks traded on BSE at 12.04 pm on July 14, 2025, 1,783 advanced against 2,163 stocks that declined, and 189 remained unchanged.

A total of 235 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 194 in the lower circuit. “Gold prices continued their upward trend, approaching the $3,400 per ounce level globally, following renewed trade tensions sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of additional tariffs on the European Union and Mexico. While Trump has allowed room for negotiations until August 1, the potential for a rapid escalation has kept risk assets under pressure, prompting investors to seek safety in haven assets like gold. Looking ahead, inflation data due on Tuesday, along with a busy week of corporate earnings, will help shape gold’s near-term direction. However, the strength of the U.S. dollar, bolstered by these trade uncertainties, may limit further gains in the precious metal.” Anthem Biosciences Limited’s ₹3,395 crore initial public offering received a tepid response on its first day, with the issue subscribed only 0.19 times by midday Monday.

Source: Reuters Crude oil futures traded higher on Monday morning as markets awaited a ‘major announcement’ by US President Donald Trump on Russia. At 9.22 am on Monday, September Brent oil futures were at $70.50, up by 0.20 per cent, and August crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, up by 0.22 per cent. July crude oil futures were trading at ₹5899 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹5881, up by 0.31 per cent, and August futures were trading at ₹5797 against the previous close of ₹5779, up by 0.31 per cent. ● Total Income grew to ₹7,819.82 million, up 11.34% from ₹7,023.56 million in FY24, driven by higher daily dispatches, an expanded vendor base and greater wallet share from repeat customers. ● EBITDA rose to ₹579.75 million, up 345.3% YoY, with margin expansion of 561 basis points to 7.48%, supported by a strategic product mix shift, growing share of third-party manufactured products, expanding services and operational efficiency. ● PAT for FY25 was ₹60.13 million, compared to a loss of ₹172.98 million in FY24 reflecting a strong turnaround driven by scale, stronger margins and disciplined cost control, despite absorbing ₹73.73 million in IPO-related expenses. Shares up 1.69% on the NSE to ₹165.90 Morning Outlook – 14th July 2025 Indian benchmark indices are expected to open on a flat to slightly negative note today, as suggested by the GIFT Nifty, which indicates a marginal decline of around 34 points in the Nifty 50. Market sentiment remains mildly indecisive, following a cautious close in the previous session. The Nifty 50 opened weak and traded in a narrow range for most of the session. However, a sudden sell-off towards the end dragged the index lower, forming a bearish candlestick that signals negative sentiment. Technically, a sustained move above 25,378 could pave the way for an upward rally toward 25,500. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 25,120 and 25,000, which may serve as potential entry points for long trades if stability emerges around these levels. The Bank Nifty ended the session in the red, losing 201 points, and formed a bearish candlestick with a long upper wick, reflecting selling pressure at higher levels. A decisive breakdown below 56,600 could lead to further downside toward 56,420 and 56,234. However, if these support levels hold, a reversal may follow, offering fresh buying opportunities. On the upside, resistance lies in the 56,817–57,000 zone, with a breakout above this range potentially triggering a rally toward 57,175. On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers of equities worth ₹5,104 crore on July 11, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers, investing ₹3,558 crore. In the current environment of heightened volatility and mixed market signals, traders are advised to follow a cautious “sell on rise” strategy, especially when trading with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and using tight trailing stop-losses is recommended to manage risk effectively. Fresh long positions should only be considered if the Nifty sustains above the 25,378 level. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is essential to keep a close watch on key technical levels and global market cues.

The fall was mainly due to a $3.53 billion drop in foreign currency assets, which stood at $591.29 billion. In contrast, gold reserves rose by $342 million to $84.5 billion, SDRs increased by $39 million to $18.86 billion, while the IMF reserve position declined by $107 million to $4.73 billion during the same period. 2)Overseas investors repatriated a record $97.7 billion from Indian investments in FY25. This is up from $87.5 billion in FY24. The increase is due to higher FDI inflows and debt investments. RBI data indicates a rise in income from foreign exchange reserves deployment. Indian companies also increased overseas investments. This balanced the investment income segment of the current account. 3)As of July 4, 2025, the RBI’s weekly data shows that loans to state governments rose sharply by ₹10,890 crore over the week to ₹30,956 crore. Scheduled Commercial Banks’ aggregate deposits stood at ₹234.26 lakh crore, growing 1.5% fortnightly and 10.1% YoY, while bank credit rose to ₹184.83 lakh crore, up 0.9% fortnightly and 9.5% YoY. Within M3 (money supply), which rose 9.6% YoY to ₹281.77 lakh crore, demand deposits showed strong 17.1% annual growth. Liquidity operations reflected large-scale absorption by the RBI via the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), peaking at ₹3.32 lakh crore on July 4, with net daily absorption consistently exceeding ₹2.5 lakh crore throughout the week, indicating tight liquidity management. 4)As of June 27, 2025, aggregate deposits of all scheduled banks rose to ₹239.16 lakh crore from ₹235.62 lakh crore in mid-June, with demand deposits at ₹31.22 lakh crore and time deposits at ₹207.95 lakh crore. Bank credit (excluding inter-bank) increased to ₹189.53 lakh crore from ₹187.84 lakh crore, led by loans and advances of ₹186.10 lakh crore. Investments stood at ₹68.54 lakh crore, mainly in central and state government securities. Balances with the RBI were stable at ₹9.53 lakh crore, while cash held fell slightly to ₹89,278 crore. Borrowings from the RBI dropped to ₹1,065 crore, and food credit by scheduled commercial banks declined marginally to ₹64,389 crore from ₹67,606 crore in mid-June. The total number of scheduled commercial banks remained at 120. 5)In June, mutual fund inflows surged 67% month-on-month to ₹49,301 crore from ₹29,572 crore in May, with total AUM rising 3% to ₹74.14 lakh crore. Equity mutual funds saw inflows jump 24% to ₹23,587 crore, led by flexi-cap funds (₹5,733 crore), small-cap (₹4,024 crore), and mid-cap funds (₹3,754 crore), while ELSS recorded outflows of ₹556 crore. Debt funds saw reduced outflows of ₹1,711 crore (vs ₹15,908 crore in May), with short duration (₹10,276 crore) and money market funds (₹9,484 crore) leading inflows; liquid funds faced the highest outflow at ₹25,196 crore. Hybrid funds’ inflows rose 12% to ₹23,222 crore, with arbitrage funds leading at ₹15,584 crore and aggressive hybrid funds jumping 290% to ₹1,331 crore.

The move aims to diversify exposure across emerging markets, potentially raising the index’s average yield by giving more weight to higher-yielding, riskier countries—impacting over $200 billion in funds tracking the benchmark. 8)India’s corporate bond market is set for a major transformation with the launch of Bond Central, a SEBI- and OBPP-backed platform that offers a centralized, transparent database for bond issuances. By providing easy access to pricing, risk metrics, and disclosures, and lowering the minimum investment to ₹10,000, the platform aims to boost retail participation, enhance price discovery, and align with global standards like FINRA TRACE. WORLD 1)The IEA’s July 2025 Oil Market Report highlights a volatile first half of the year for global oil markets, marked by slowing demand growth due to a weaker economic outlook and rising clean energy adoption, particularly in non-OECD countries like China. While seasonal demand is expected to pick up, global supply rose in May as OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers increased output, with non-OPEC+ set to drive future growth. Inventories surged, especially in non-OECD regions, and oil prices fluctuated widely amid geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ policy shifts. Refinery margins peaked in May but were later squeezed by crude price hikes. The report also noted rising NGL output and the impact of global trade and energy policy shifts on market dynamics. 2)The FOMC minutes from the June 17–18, 2025 meeting showed the Fed held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% while continuing balance sheet runoff, set to conclude by Feb 2026. While Q2 GDP rebounded and unemployment held at 4.2%, core PCE inflation at 2.6% remained above target. Tariffs and geopolitical risks may pose near-term inflation pressures, but wage growth was seen as contained. Risks remain tilted toward higher inflation and slower growth, with most members expecting 1–2 rate cuts in 2025, likely starting in September, though views differ. The Fed reaffirmed a data-dependent approach and discussed enhancing policy communication tools. 3)US jobless claims fell to 227K for the week ending July 5, below expectations and down from the revised 232K the prior week. The insured unemployment rate held steady at 1.3%, while the four-week average dropped to 235.5K. However, continuing jobless claims rose by 10K to 1.965 million for the week ending June 28. 4)The latest US Redbook Index (YoY) reading is 5.9%, as of July 2025, according to Trading Economics. This is up from the previous reading of 4.9%. The Redbook Index measures year-over-year same-store sales growth in a sample of large US general merchandise retailers. 5)The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in May, missing expectations of 0.1% growth and following a 0.3% decline in April, according to ONS data. The services index slowed to 0.4% (3M/3M) from 0.6%, while industrial and manufacturing production dropped 0.9% and 1% respectively, both below market forecasts. 6)The UK’s trade deficit widened by £6.7 billion to £13.2 billion in the three months to May, driven by a £6.1 billion rise in the goods deficit to £61 billion and a £0.6 billion dip in the services surplus to £47.8 billion. In May, both exports and imports rose by £0.6 billion. Notably, UK goods exports to the US rose by £0.3 billion, while imports from the US fell £0.9 billion, amid shifts in US trade policy despite a new trade deal effective from June 30. 7)The Bank of England’s July 2025 Financial Stability Report highlights that the UK financial system remains resilient despite rising global risks. Mortgage repayments are set to rise for millions, prompting a relaxation in high loan-to-income limits to support first-time buyers. Key risks include global trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, vulnerabilities in non-bank finance, and climate change. The BoE is also reviewing capital buffer frameworks and enhancing climate risk integration to strengthen systemic stability. 8)Japan’s producer prices rose 2.9% YoY in June 2025, easing from 3.2% in May and marking the lowest print since August 2024, in line with forecasts. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.2%, following a 0.1% drop in May, signaling continued softening in input costs. 9)China’s CPI rose 0.1% YoY in June, rebounding slightly from May’s -0.1% and beating expectations of 0%, while monthly CPI slipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, PPI declined 3.6% YoY, deeper than May’s 3.3% fall and below the expected 3.2%, signaling continued deflationary pressure in factory prices. 10)In a surprise move, the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates steady at 3.85% on July 8, despite market expectations of a cut. The decision, passed by a 6–3 vote, reflects the RBA’s view that inflation risks are more balanced and the labour market remains strong, though uncertainty around demand and supply persists. The board chose to wait for more data to confirm inflation is on track to sustainably reach its 2.5% target. 11)The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) board members decided to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.25% following the conclusion of the July policy meeting on Wednesday. The decision aligned with the market expectations. The RBNZ stood pat on the policy rate after six consecutive cuts. Siemens: Company secures two separate orders worth Rs 773 cr from MAHA-METRO.

According to Fortune, Huang’s wealth reached $143.7 billion on Friday morning, which puts him just ahead of Buffett’s $142.1 billion. At the same time, Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index showed that the two are nearly tied, with Huang at $143 billion and Buffett at $144 billion. Regardless of the exact numbers, Huang’s fortune has grown by about $29 billion so far in 2025. Regardless of the exact numbers, Huang’s fortune has grown by about $29 billion so far in 2025.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. I can’t understandably describe the more recent history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia 16 posted on 07/13/2025 7:19:33 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Hopper architecture was the first Nvidia architecture to implement the transformer engine. The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) 17 posted on 07/13/2025 7:24:58 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance.

The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) 17 posted on 07/13/2025 7:24:58 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes.

The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm 19 posted on 07/13/2025 7:34:08 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep Maybe he buy a sport jacket. 20 posted on 07/14/2025 2:25:03 AM PDT by minnesota_bound (Making money now.

(Excerpt) Read more at tipranks.com ... What do Omar, Crockett, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, et al have to say about this “greedy oligarch”? Huang has created probably ten million more jobs than all those commies put together. Pelosi has gotten so rich off this guy. At least he created something. Pelosi, Omar, Crockett, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, have never created anything... He and the other two started the company off with $40,000 and used a townhouse owned by one of them for an office. How long until some judgie poo says he’s paid too much and takes back money from his pay ? I would rather have Buffet’s portfolio. We're blessed by men like Jensen Huang - men who follow their dreams, take risks and create businesses so all of us can live better lives. Capitalism works. “ Capitalism works” The proof is all around us in so many ways every single day. But the brain-dead idiots who adore communism never once ask the obvious question: “Why did NONE of these wonders originate in the Soviet Union, any Soviet “Socialist Republic,” in North Korea, in Cuba, in Venezuela?” I didn’t read the article, but I saw an article title proclaiming AMD could make Nvidia performance level chips. https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-popped-after-analyst-said-new-ai-chips-could-take-on-nvidias-watch-these-key-price-levels-11770309 Note: The claim is beyond my ability to verify. Nvidia and its chips have always been well-respected by me. However, $4 trillion is really big money. “Huang has created probably ten million more jobs than all those commies put together.” He has created a lot of wealth and a lot of jobs, but I doubt even one million jobs. There is going to be a lot of money made from AI, such as from education, policing and elder care, but the software development may not be fast enough to see it mostly in the form of AI chip sales profits. WIKI Nvidia Corporation[a] (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. I can’t understandably describe the more recent history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia WIKI The Hopper architecture was the first Nvidia architecture to implement the transformer engine. The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, it is also a good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties. Initialize the scoring matrix. The dimensions of the scoring matrix are 1+length of each sequence respectively. All the elements of the first row and the first column are set to 0. The extra first row and first column make it possible to align one sequence to another at any position, and setting them to 0 makes the terminal gap free from penalty. Scoring. Score each element from left to right, top to bottom in the matrix, considering the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). If none of the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used and the source of that score is recorded. Traceback. Starting at the element with the highest score, traceback based on the source of each score recursively, until 0 is encountered. The segments that have the highest similarity score based on the given scoring system is generated in this process. To obtain the second best local alignment, apply the traceback process starting at the second highest score outside the trace of the best alignment. The Smith–Waterman algorithm finds the segments in two sequences that have similarities while the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm aligns two complete sequences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm WIKI The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970. The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm Maybe he buy a sport jacket.

Title: Former Xbox employee's LinkedIn page reveals Forza Horizon 5 PS5 sales

Notebookcheck has been contacted by the person whose LinkedIn page mentioned the 2,000,000 number. They claim that it's not accurate first-party data but rather an estimate that they found online. Slightly edited article continues as follows: Earlier this year, Xbox announced that Forza Horizon 5 would become available on the PS5, nearly four years after it was released on Xbox and PC. The game eventually landed on the PlayStation 5 on April 29, 2025 as the first Forza game available on a platform other than Xbox and PC. Now, the LinkedIn page of an Xbox employee has revealed how well the game did on PlayStation. According to a post shared on X by Zuby_Tech, Forza Horizon 5 for the PlayStation 5 sold two million units in one month. The info comes from the LinkedIn page of former Xbox employee who had worked as a game designer at Turn 10 Studios, a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios but was recently laid off along with several others from Xbox. Listing his responsibilities at the studio, the game designer wrote that he created the cross-platform feature designs that allowed Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5 (available on Amazon for $499) to sell 2 million units in one month alone. That's an impressive figure for a video game that was released years ago on Xbox. While we don't know the total sales as of the time of writing, it most likely is well past two million units since it has been over two months since the game launched on the PS5. Xbox's recent layoffs have greatly affected Turn 10 Studios which is best known for its Forza Motorsport series. The studio lost half of its team, and has now been relegated to providing support for the Forza Horizon series. In addition, it has been reported that the Forza Motorsport series has been axed leaving the open world Forza Horizon series which is developed by Playground Games. Forza Horizon is expected to get a new installment next year. Zuby_Tech on X, Pushsquare

Title: With Markets At All-Time Highs, A First-Time Investor Hesitates. The Fear Of Buying At The Top Is Hard To Shake

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. A Reddit user recently opened up about a common fear many new investors face: buying into the stock market when prices are peaking. “I feel weird about starting investing when companies are in an all-time high,” wrote the poster, who said they’re ready to invest a lump sum this month but are second-guessing the timing. Today's Best Finance Deals The person, who isn’t currently invested outside of a 401(k), said they believe in the long-term potential of AI and tech companies. They’re not expecting massive short-term gains, but they do hope that “the current top companies with a combined market cap of 10T might be worth 2-3x more 20 years from now.” Don't Miss: Their hesitation comes at a time when the markets continue to break records. On July 10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed roughly 0.4% in a continuation of recent gains across major indexes. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% to finish at a new record high of 6,280.46, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.1% to mark its second consecutive all-time high. AI chipmaker Nvidia NVDA closed slightly higher, ending the day just above a $4 trillion market cap, making it the first public company in history to surpass that milestone. The post triggered many responses from Reddit’s r/stocks community, most urging the user to stop overthinking and just start investing. “If you bought at the all time highs for each year, you wouldn’t be far from those who perfectly timed the bottoms,” one investor said, referencing data that shows time in the market typically beats trying to time the market. Another pointed out that the market is almost always at a high. “Zoom out, the market is usually near or at ATH,” they wrote. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. Plenty of commenters acknowledged the fear of losing money right after a big buy. While many recognized that lump sum investing performs better most of the time, others recommended a slower approach known as dollar-cost averaging. “DCA isn't to get the most gains, it's to remove the possibility of buying a large sum and having it crash right after,” one person wrote. “It's like buying insurance.” Others were more straightforward. “There's always a reason not to buy,” one person said. “When you lose out on thousands years from now, not getting in, you'll regret it.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now One Redditor shared their own anxiety-ridden journey as a new investor who inherited money from a parent: “Sometimes I feel like the more informed I am, the worse my returns have become.” There was also plenty of humor in the thread. “Just know that as soon as you buy, the market will crash. That’s the law of this subreddit,” joked one top comment. Despite the jokes and differing strategies, most commenters echoed the same long-term philosophy: invest early, stay consistent, and don't let fear paralyze you. As one put it, “You can buy at all time highs today or at all time highs five years from now. Your choice.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners
URL: https://spiral.spyglass.org/p/strap-in-vision-pro-owners
Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen.

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners

Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z

Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen. [Variety] In other computing headwear news, Meta has formalized their investment in EssilorLuxottica – $3.5B into the publicly-traded firm for a stake just under 3%, which they hope to bring up to 5%. Most importantly, this seemingly formalizes the fact that Google/Samsung/Apple/Snap/etc won't be working with their brands on any competing products...

Title: Algolia Tops Google In Product Search — Windsurf May Not Help Much

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Gartner rates privately-held Algolia ahead of Google in the $56 billion market for search and product discovery. With Alphabet stock down this year, investors should be worried. GERMANY - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone with the website of ai search ... More engine company Algolia Inc. is seen in front of business logo. (Photo Illustration by Timon Schneider/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The market for digital commerce search reached $56.5 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow at a 12.6% compound annual rate to $185.7 billion in 2033, reports Data Horizon Research. Algolia’s customer base has grown at a 21% average annual rate to 18,000, according to my July 10 interview with Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon. Google — shares of which have lost 5% of their value in 2025 — is confident in the strength of its product discovery search service, according to a Google company release. Gartner rates privately-held San Francisco-based Algolia ahead of Google. Google’s spent $2.4 billion to license Windsurf AI coding technology, reported CNBC. That unlikely to be enough for Google to surpass Algolia — or faster-growing AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google shares have lost value in 2025. That’s because the search giant — which developed the core Transformer model for predicting the next word based on its context underlying generative AI, according to my book, Brain Rush — is struggling to catch up with ChatGPT and others when it comes to commercializing its idea. Is the drop in Google stock a buying opportunity? The answer depends on whether Google can keep its search business relevant. “The market will need to see fundamental evidence that Google search is indeed going to be more durable than currently appreciated,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report featured by Investor’s Business Daily. If rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Meta AI better deploy generative AI to cash in on advertising and improved e-commerce and travel verticals, Google’s stock could keep dropping, noted Nowak. For Google bulls, I have bad news: Algolia — which says it is deploying agentic AI for brands — is ahead of Google in those two search and product discovery verticals. In 2018, I was surprised to learn Google had abandoned the business of helping consumers search through a company's online product catalog, according to my October 2018 Forbes post. Google was good at bringing users to a website but once there, customers relied on the websites’ own search functions to find products. Some companies "build their own engines; others use open-source software, such as Elasticsearch,” the Economist reported. At the time, Algolia — founded in Paris in 2012 — was rapidly taking a piece of that pie by supplying a service that "hunts the client’s website and swiftly offers consumers relevant results," added the Economist. Since then, Google has entered this market and this year was deemed a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for vision and ability to execute. However, within that elite group of leaders, Algolia is the top dog. Read on for why this market is significant and why I do not think Google is doing enough to overtake Algolia and larger rivals in monetizing AI. I requested comment from Google and will update this post if I receive a reply. While analysts use many ways to describe the digital commerce search industry, they agree the industry is growing fast and will become far larger in the next decade. The industry’s goal is to understand consumers’ needs and recommend products that best satisfy those needs. AI is the most significant growth propellent for this business in year — it enhances consumer experiences, increase sales, and boosts engagement, according to SuperAGI. AI-driven recommendation engines can increase customer loyalty, average order size and the lifetime value of a customer. For example, 71% of consumers are more likely to return to a website offering personalized experiences. Moreover, such systems suggest complementary products — thereby increasing average order value by 10% to 15%, reported SuperAGI. Algolia appears to be riding this growth wave. The company provides an AI-native search and discovery platform to enable brands such as PetSmart, Best Buy, Chewy, Twitch, Stripe, and Under Armour to deliver fast, relevant, and personalized search experiences, according to an Algolia release. Algolia’s search-as-a-service solution uses AI recommendations, NeuralSearch, and real-time personalization to boosts user engagement and increase conversion rates, the release added. Algolia has added many customers in the last five years. “When I joined Algolia we had less than 7,000 customers, now we have 18,000,” Nixon — who joined the company in 2020 — told me. “We process two billion transactions per year and have millions of developers on our platform.” Algolia’s growth can be attributed to its ability to satisfy e-commerce search customers’ need for reliable performance at scale. “We provide five nine’s reliability which means only 26 seconds of downtime per month,” she said. “Reliability is really important and it is difficult to do when operating at scale.” Algolia has repeatedly introduced meaningful innovations. “We disrupted the market three times and we are about to do it a fourth,” Nixon explained. Instead of relying on preexisting search software such as Lucene, Algolia’s search was built from scratch to work on mobile. Next, the company introduced search as a service and charged customers based on the number of searches — with the price per search declining with the number of searches. Finally, in 2023, Algolia introduced hybrid search — “combining keyword and natural language search incorporating large language models,” she told me. Algolia is most excited about agentic AI — which will enable consumers to take action towards a goal. The company uses Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol — which allows AI agents to access Algolia's search, analytics, recommendations, and index configuration APIs. “AI agents must be able to work across walled gardens to traverse a company’s back-end seamlessly to retrieve data,” she said. “To that end, we have partnered with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager.” Algolia’s customers are benefiting from how much consumers’ use of ChatGPT to search for products is adding to web traffic. “Adobe Analytics has found generative AI is giving retailers and banks 1,200% traffic increases while travel sites are seeing 1,700% increases,” she told me. “When people come to a retailer’s site they bounce 23% less frequently and look at 12% more pages per visit.” Algolia also provides personalized digital shopping guides — say, for Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day — targeted towards various lifestyles. “In beta test, we have 73 shopping guides already,” she concluded. Google's offerings — notably Google Ads and Vertex AI Search for Commerce — can boost retailer revenues in three ways: In July 2025, Gartner ranked Google and Algolia as Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery leaders based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Algolia is the leader among leaders — prevailing over Google. Algolia is proud of Gartner’s recognition. “This is the second year we have been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery,” Nixon told me. “We are up and to the right in the leader box which makes us the best in the industry for completeness of vision and ability to execute. How? We want to make search easy for the masses. We wanted to be scalable in the enterprise. We solve the search puzzle for the masses.” Google was happy to be an MQ leader. “We believe this recognition affirms Google’s evolving commitment to delivering high ROI-generating product discovery, through the use of AI in relevance, ranking, and personalization,” noted Google Cloud AI Director, Product Management Sachin Padwal in a July 8 company release. Algolia is ahead of Google in applying agentic AI for search and product discovery. While Google has not yet launched such a service, on July 11 the search giant acquired executive talent and intellectual property from Windsurf — a leader in agentic AI, noted CNBC. Algolia’s MCP Server — launched in June 2025 — enables LLMs and autonomous agents to work together to help consumers buy what they need more quickly. For example, Algolia’s agentic AI service can help consumers book a Mediterranean cruise. By retrieving relevant consumer information from platforms such as Adobe and Salesforce. For example, Algolia agentic AI service can recommend and book a cruise based on each guest’s chosen destinations, travel history, and other preferences — in milliseconds, according to a company release. “This isn’t about showing off what agents could do,” Nixon said. “It’s about showing what they can do right now with a powerful user experience, if they have the right layer of intelligence underneath. That’s where Algolia fits.” Meanwhile, Google is currently experimenting with agentic AI for travel. Google’s “AI Mode” will be able to “plan full itineraries, remember context, and keep users within the AI interface — even for booking,” noted Hospitality.today. “Google’s Project Mariner” will enable “AI to take actions online -- like booking a hotel or tracking flight prices.” Google stock is 12% undervalued based on the average price target of 37 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRank. If Algolia’s lead over Google in search and product discovery is any indication, those analysts could be too optimistic.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Preview

Time Published: 2025-07-13T12:23:53Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The second-quarter earnings season begins this week, with 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. ... More This week has a heavy emphasis on banks including: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (AP Photo/File) The second-quarter earnings season begins this week. 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, with a heavy emphasis on the large banks. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Blackrock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs (GS), PepsiCo (PEP), Netflix (NFLX), 3M (MMM), and American Express (AXP). With only a few companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 4.8% year-over-year, slightly below the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings growth rate is 9.0% and 2026’s expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Tariff worries led to a slight decline in the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results next week. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth According to FactSet data, the earnings expectations for the financial sector are deceptively low due to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). JPM reported a significant gain from sales of Visa (V) stock in the same quarter last year, so the company has challenging year-over-year comparisons. If JPM is excluded from the financial sector, year-over-year earnings growth improves to 9.3% from 2.4%. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector On the other side of the ledger, earnings growth rate expectations within the communication services sector are being flattered by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). According to FactSet, WBD reported a significant loss last year due to a goodwill impairment charge, so it is benefiting from extremely easy comparisons. If WBD is excluded, the expected growth of the communication services sector falls from 29.4% year-over-year to 8.2%. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Energy Commodities Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be some upside to sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.2% is meeting expectations. GDP Growth Fuels S&P 500 Sales Consistent with the earnings picture, revenues in the energy sector should see the most significant year-over-year decline. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. US Dollar The economic calendar also heats up this week with consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales. Tuesday’s June CPI is expected to be hotter, increasing to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.4%. The Federal Reserve already expects some inflation impact from tariffs and is likely on the sidelines until at least September. The retail sales report on Thursday is expected to show a modest rebound for the US consumer. Since consumers are a crucial driver of the US economy, this rebound will be essential for economic growth expectations. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to be implemented on August 1, barring an acceptable trade agreement. With financials dominating the first week of earnings season, the headline earnings should begin on a positive note. With the tariff overhang and consensus expecting an acceleration in earnings growth for the third quarter, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched closely.

Title: Wall Street’s Deepest Values: 5 Cheap CEFs Yielding 7%+

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Travel Destination The last bargains on the big board? Discounted closed-end funds (CEFs). CEFs are often the “last stop” for dividend deals. We are talking about an inefficient corner of the income universe, which is just great for us contrarians—we love the discounts. And these funds can trade for less than “fair value” for months and even years on end. When the markets washed out in April, these CEFs were discarded by their vanilla dividend owners. Let’s pick up the pieces for up to 12% off, or 88 cents on the dollar. And in the process secure yields up to 9.7%. Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX)Distribution Rate: 8.4% We’ll start with the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), an example of a strategy that thrives in CEF land: covered calls. DIAX’s five fund managers attempt to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but with less volatility, by owning the DJIA’s components while also selling call options on between 35% and 75% of the notional value of the equity portfolio. Covered-call funds generally offer the exact same tradeoff: Receive lower volatility and a higher percentage of returns coming from distributions in exchange for lesser overall performance than the underlying index (because DIAX’s holdings are being “called away” as they rise). Unfortunately, in the case of DIAX, the underperformance is stark, even when considering a distribution rate that’s more than 5x the Dow’s dividend yield. We’re generally better off buying funds like DIAX when we think the Dow is toppy. The fund trades at an 11% discount as I write, more than its recent average of 9%. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 8.3% Numerous CEFs turn income-unfriendly segments of the market into distribution funnels. Take the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG), which generates an 8%-plus monthly payout from a few dozen technology, communications, and consumer stocks. While thematic ETFs are a dime a dozen, thematic CEFs like NBXG are few and far between. This Neuberger fund’s theme is next-generation connectivity; managers Hari Ramanan, Yan Taw Boon, and Timothy Creedom seek out stocks that “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But if we take a quick look, it’s pretty apparent NBXG can also stand in as a play on artificial intelligence (AI). Mag 7 holdings such as Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are pretty direct plays on AI at this point. The fund even invests in private companies, such as AI-powered Grammarly. It also engages in options trading to generate gains from options premiums and tamp down on risk. Neuberger’s CEF has trailed the tech sector since inception, though that’s not a terribly fair comparison given its exposure to other sectors. Still, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past 18 months or so: The fund’s discount to NAV is generous, at 11.2% currently, so we have NBXG’s assets selling for 89 cents on the dollar..) Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT)Distribution Rate: 7.5% Another place we might not expect a high-single-digit yield? Small-cap stocks. But that’s exactly what we get from Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT). RMT—managed by Jim Stoeffel and Andrew Palen—is a micro-cap value fund in name, though given an average market cap of about $750 million, it’s truly closer to small-cap in nature. Still, not exactly a who’s who of ballyhooed dividend names. Holdings include the likes of electronic component maker Bel Fuse (BELFA), which pays a fractional yield, and online advertising firm Magnite (MGNI), which pays no dividend whatsoever. So, what’s with the big distribution? RMT doesn’t really trade options, nor does it use debt leverage. Instead, it’s just a quarterly distribution of predominantly long-term capital gains. Not ideal, but RMT pulls it off. I’ve previously pointed out that RMT always trades at a discount, and indeed, it’s trading right around its five-year average discount to NAV (12%). That’s not exactly a good thing—ideally, management should have a plan to close that discount at some point. But it’s hard to knock Royce too much given RMT’s consistent outperformance. Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR)Distribution Rate: 9.7% Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR) is a “portfolio in a can,” capable of investing in stocks and a wide array of bonds and other fixed income, both domestically and internationally. ZTR’s four-manager team has currently built a 75/25 stock/bond portfolio. The equity sleeve is both lopsided and defensive in nature; half of its weight is in utilities, while the rest is largely taken up by industrials and energy firms. On the debt side, ZTR owns investment-grade and junk corporates, emerging-market bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, Treasuries, and more. Like many closed-end funds (but unlike the CEFs above), ZTR amplifies its bets through debt; it currently has 130% of assets invested thanks to debt leverage. Virtus Total Return is considered a “moderate allocation” fund, which refers to funds that typically have between 50% and 70% of their assets invested in stocks (with the rest in bonds and/or cash). While this CEF currently has a 75/25 blend, I’ve seen it as low as 60/40 when looking at it in the past. Still, for comparison’s sake, it’s worth looking at ZTR against a couple different allocation benchmarks—in this case, a 60/40 ETF and a more aggressive 80/20 ETF. Virtus’ fund has enjoyed pockets of outperformance in the past, but the fund has lost an enormous amount of ground recently. Its dips have been harsher than the plain-vanilla ETFs, which is normal for a leveraged CEF, but its recoveries have been more muted—the opposite of what we’d expect. Unfortunately, that blunts the appeal of ZTR’s nearly 10% distribution (paid monthly), as well as a roughly 11% discount to NAV that’s cheaper than its five-year average (8%). Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW)Distribution Rate: 8.4% Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) is a global fund that can invest not just in common stock, but investment-grade corporates, junk corporates, preferred stock, bank loans, convertible debt, asset-backed securities, US government securities, options, and more. At the moment, about two-thirds of assets are invested in common stock, with another 15% in convertibles, 10% in corporate debt, and the rest scattered around the other categories. Geographically speaking, the US accounts for a little more than half of the fund’s assets, with the rest in developed markets like Germany, Japan, and Canada, as well as emerging markets like China and India. On top of all of that, CHW’s five-manager team also utilizes a hefty amount of debt leverage: just south of 30% currently. There aren’t many global allocation funds out there, and those that are simply aren’t built the way CHW is—especially given that management has a long leash and a lot of assets they can explore. But comparisons against the SPDR SSGA Global Allocation ETF (GAL)—an ETF in the same category (global moderate allocation)—are favorable, albeit bumpier. CHW is also trading at a tasty 10.7% discount to NAV that’s more than twice as deep as its five-year average, and it’s doling out an 8%+ distribution, paid monthly.

Title: What it takes to be a thriving Amazon seller making seven figures

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all? Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does. What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you. On the agenda today: But first: Side hustle tips from the pros. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online. Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success. How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers? A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club. What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits? The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to "a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there." He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum. What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle? After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming. I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, "It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you." For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration. BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like "fear," "uncertainty," "disheartening," and "bleak" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service. "I can't see any of this ending well." Also read: When the Sequoia Capital partner called NYC mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani an "Islamist," it made national news and prompted two open letters. Instead of an apology or deleted tweet, however, Maguire only doubled down on his comments. The saga might just mark a new era in a post-pandemic tech ecosystem. Top investors have learned they can be loud, bold, and polarizing, and it won't impact their ability to secure deals. The venture capital "fame game." Also read: Though the financial industry isn't the obvious target of Trump's immigration crackdown, its effects are still being felt across hiring, travel, and dealmaking. Lawyers, executives, and business leaders told BI how Trump's border policy is changing their daily lives, from amending the language they use at the border to scrutinizing immigration compliance in M&A deals. Wall Street as a border town. The search and cloud giant keeps salary data confidential. However, publicly available work visa data filed with the US Labor Department offers a glimpse of how much it pays certain roles. Google has hired thousands of software engineers through this process. The data shows they can command salaries as high as $340,000 before equity and bonuses. See how much key roles make. This week's quote: "She always made it clear she would walk away when the time was right. She made enough money that she doesn't need to work." — Linda Yaccarino's friend on Yaccarino leaving her CEO role at X. More of this week's top reads: Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino couldn't turn Elon Musk's business around — because of Elon Musk. The BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, July 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Wall Street Firm Abruptly Upgrades JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, Says Upside Scenario Now Base Case for Big Banks

Boutique investment bank KBW believes JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are primed to witness higher prices as conditions conspire to favor large US banks In a new interview on CNBC Television, KBW head of US bank research Chris McGratty says the firm has upgraded its ratings for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to outperform, with price targets of $327 for JPM and $160 for MS. According to McGratty, large banks are poised to benefit from easing regulations due to their scale-driven efficiency and consistent performance. “You are seeing a re-rating. This re-rating has been occurring for the past couple of months. Deregulation is being built into earnings estimate upside scenarios, blue skies, and the reality is that the upside scenario is becoming the base-case scenario. So you’re seeing the universal, the largest six banks, lead the charge. We’ve gotten a lot of positive news on deregulation, and that’s one of three themes with this launch is deregulation. The other two themes are scale and consistency, and any way you check it, the largest banks have all three under the relative winners.” As of Friday’s close, JPM is trading at $286 and MS is worth $142. Another banking giant on McGratty’s radar is Citi (C). McGratty says Citi may be the most undervalued stock among the group based on its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a financial metric that measures how efficiently a bank is generating profits for its common shareholders. “If you think about their guide, their 10-11% ROTCE guide for next year, they took that down earlier this year. So the bar has been lowered. But if you look at where expectations are, we’re in the low to mid-9%. So there’s a big gap between low 9% and 10 to 11%. So if they can get that right, it’s the cheapest stock in the group. They’ve got a buyback catalyst. It’s very accretive when you can buy your stock back below 10 to a book value. And so this deregulatory environment for Citi is hugely helpful. The reason the ROE (return on equity) is so low is that the expenses have had to play catch-up. That investment phase is done, and so what the company is doing now is they are generating revenue. They are generating positive operating leverage across their businesses, and if they can get the macro to settle in a bit, this is a company I think we can re-rate quite a bit.” KBW is a New York-based firm known for its deep expertise in financials and bank stock coverage.

Title: VTI Vs. VOO: Comparing The Risk And Resilience Of These ETFs In A Volatile Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/vti-vs-voo-comparing-risk-resilience-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-07-12T16:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different ... More approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. When it comes to broad market exposure through exchange-traded funds, two Vanguard offerings consistently dominate investor conversations: VTI and VOO. Both funds have garnered massive followings among retail and institutional investors alike, yet they represent fundamentally different approaches to capturing U.S. equity market returns. While both ETFs offer low-cost access to American stocks, their structural differences create distinct risk profiles that become particularly pronounced during periods of market volatility. Understanding how these two popular funds respond to market turbulence requires examining their underlying compositions, diversification strategies, and historical performance patterns. This analysis will examine the nuanced differences between VTI's total market approach and VOO's S&P 500 focus, enabling investors to determine which fund better aligns with their risk tolerance and investment objectives during uncertain market conditions. Before diving into risk analysis and volatility comparisons, it's essential to understand the core characteristics that define each fund. While both VTI and VOO are Vanguard products that track U.S. equity markets, their methodologies and scopes differ significantly, creating unique investment profiles that appeal to different investor preferences and market outlooks. VTI seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, representing nearly 100% of the investable U.S. stock market across all capitalization segments. Launched on May 31, 2001, this fund has grown to become one of the largest ETFs globally, with net assets exceeding $1.81 trillion. The fund employs a sampling strategy to closely match its benchmark index, which includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks across all sectors of the American economy. The fund's broad mandate means it holds thousands of individual securities, with its top 10 holdings representing just 26.5% of total assets. Apple leads at 5.58%, followed by Microsoft at 4.93%, demonstrating how even the most prominent companies maintain relatively modest weightings within the total market context. This diversification extends across sectors, with technology commanding the largest allocation at 23.78%, followed by healthcare at 14.10% and financial services at 13.54%. VOO tracks the S&P 500 Index, focusing exclusively on the 500 largest publicly traded U.S. companies by market capitalization. Launched on September 9, 2010, this fund has accumulated approximately $1.4 trillion in net assets, making it one of the most popular large-cap equity investments available. The fund's benchmark represents roughly 80% of the total U.S. stock market by value, concentrating on established, profitable companies that meet specific criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500. The fund's top 10 holdings carry more weight than VTI's, representing 30.78% of total assets. Apple dominates with a 6.57% allocation, followed by Microsoft at 5.80%. This higher concentration reflects the market-cap weighted nature of the S&P 500, where the most prominent companies naturally command greater influence over fund performance. Sector allocation mirrors VTI's general distribution but with slight variations, including technology at 24.46% and healthcare at 14.48%. The most significant difference between these funds lies in their market capitalization exposure breadth. VTI includes small- and mid-cap stocks that VOO excludes, providing exposure to approximately 4,000 securities compared to VOO's 500. This broader scope means VTI captures the entire spectrum of U.S. public companies, from micro-cap startups to mega-cap giants, while VOO focuses exclusively on large-cap established enterprises. Weighting methodologies also create subtle but important distinctions. While both funds use market-cap weighting, VTI's inclusion of smaller companies means large-cap stocks have slightly less influence on overall performance compared to VOO. This difference becomes particularly relevant during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform or underperform their large-cap counterparts, creating performance divergence between the two funds despite their substantial overlap in holdings. Examining how VTI and VOO respond to market volatility requires analyzing multiple risk dimensions, from historical price movements to sector concentration effects. While both funds track U.S. equity markets and share similar long-term return profiles, their different approaches to market exposure create distinct risk characteristics that become apparent during periods of market stress and uncertainty. Historical analysis reveals subtle but meaningful differences in how these funds handle market turbulence. VTI's broader market exposure typically results in slightly higher volatility compared to VOO, particularly during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks experience heightened price swings. Over the past decade, VTI has demonstrated a marginally higher standard deviation in monthly returns, reflecting the additional volatility contributed by its exposure to smaller companies. Risk-adjusted returns, as measured by metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, indicate that both funds perform similarly over extended periods. However, VTI occasionally edges ahead during market cycles that favor smaller companies. The fund's 10-year annualized return of 13.0% compares to VOO's 13.7%, reflecting periods where large-cap stocks outperformed; however, these differences often reverse during different market cycles. Beta measurements relative to the broader market indicate that VTI typically exhibits slightly higher market sensitivity due to its small-cap component. Both funds face similar sector concentration risks, with technology representing their largest allocation. However, subtle differences in sector weightings create varying exposure to sector-specific volatility. VOO's slightly higher technology weighting at 24.46% compared to VTI's 23.78% means greater sensitivity to technology sector movements, which can amplify both gains and losses during tech-focused market cycles. Diversification benefits emerge more clearly when examining VTI's broader sector representation. The fund's inclusion of smaller companies provides access to niche sectors and subsectors that may not be represented in the S&P 500, potentially offering some protection against concentrated sector downturns. This broader exposure can help cushion portfolio performance when specific, large-cap-dominated sectors experience significant declines; however, it also means exposure to potentially more volatile, smaller-company sectors. The most significant risk differential between these funds stems from their market capitalization exposure profiles. VTI's inclusion of small- and mid-cap stocks introduces additional volatility, as these companies tend to experience more pronounced price swings during market stress periods. Small-cap stocks often face greater liquidity constraints during market downturns, potentially amplifying losses compared to their large-cap counterparts. Conversely, VOO's focus on large-cap stocks provides inherent stability advantages during turbulent periods. Large companies typically possess stronger balance sheets, more diversified revenue streams, and better access to capital markets, helping them weather economic storms more effectively. This stability comes at the cost of potentially missing upside opportunities when smaller companies outperform, but it provides more predictable performance during uncertain market conditions. The diversification strategies employed by VTI and VOO represent different philosophies toward risk management and return optimization. While both funds offer broad U.S. market exposure, their approaches to diversification create distinct advantages and limitations that investors must consider when building portfolios designed to weather various market conditions. VTI's comprehensive market coverage provides several diversification benefits that can enhance portfolio resilience during specific market conditions. The fund's exposure to mid- and small-cap stocks offers access to companies in earlier growth stages, potentially capturing value creation that occurs before companies reach S&P 500 inclusion criteria. This broader exposure means investors participate in the full spectrum of American business success stories, from emerging growth companies to established market leaders. The fund's reduced single-stock risk represents another significant advantage. With thousands of holdings compared to VOO's 500, VTI provides greater protection against individual company failures or sector-specific downturns. This diversification becomes particularly valuable during periods of market rotation, when different segments of the market experience varying performance patterns. The fund's structure also means that no single company or small group of companies can disproportionately impact overall performance, providing more balanced exposure to market movements. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies offers distinct advantages through its bias toward quality, established enterprises. These companies have demonstrated sustained profitability, met specific financial criteria, and possess the scale necessary to compete effectively in their respective markets. This quality focus can provide more predictable performance patterns and reduced volatility compared to broader market exposure that includes smaller, potentially less stable companies. The fund's lower exposure to small-cap volatility represents a significant benefit for risk-averse investors. Small companies often experience more dramatic price swings due to limited liquidity, higher business risk, and greater sensitivity to economic cycles. By excluding these companies, VOO provides smoother performance patterns that may be more suitable for investors seeking steady, predictable returns without the additional volatility associated with smaller company exposure. The choice between VTI's broad diversification and VOO's focused approach involves important trade-offs that depend on market conditions and investor objectives. VTI's broader exposure can provide superior returns during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, but this same exposure can amplify losses when smaller companies underperform. Historical analysis shows these performance cycles can persist for extended periods, making timing considerations important for investors choosing between these approaches. VOO's focused strategy offers more predictable performance but potentially sacrifices upside opportunities available in the broader market. During periods of economic expansion when smaller companies benefit from growth opportunities, VOO investors may miss significant returns available through broader market exposure. However, during economic contractions or periods of market stress, VOO's large-cap focus often provides better downside protection, making it potentially more suitable for conservative investors or those approaching retirement. Dividend income represents an essential component of total returns for both VTI and VOO, though their different market exposures create subtle variations in yield characteristics and dividend sustainability. Understanding these differences helps investors evaluate which fund better aligns with their income generation objectives and risk tolerance regarding dividend payments. Both funds currently offer similar dividend yields of approximately 1.2%, reflecting the overall yield characteristics of the U.S. stock market. However, the composition of these yields differs due to their distinct market exposures. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides more consistent dividend payments, as larger companies often maintain more established dividend policies and possess greater financial resources to sustain payments during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure encompasses companies across the dividend spectrum, ranging from high-yielding, mature companies to growth-oriented firms that pay minimal or no dividends. This diversity can create more variable dividend income over time, as the fund's yield may fluctuate based on the relative performance and dividend policies of different market segments. Historical analysis reveals that both funds maintain relatively stable yields over extended periods, although VTI occasionally experiences slightly more yield volatility due to its broader company exposure. The dividend growth characteristics of both funds reflect the policies of their underlying holdings. Large-cap companies in VOO often demonstrate more predictable dividend growth patterns, with many maintaining consistent annual increases over extended periods. VTI's dividend growth may be less predictable due to its inclusion of smaller companies that may initiate, suspend, or dramatically alter dividend payments based on business conditions and growth opportunities. Dividend sustainability analysis reveals important differences between these funds' income generation capabilities. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies provides exposure to dividends from financially stable, profitable enterprises with established track records of maintaining payments through various economic cycles. These companies typically possess diversified revenue streams, strong balance sheets, and access to capital markets that support dividend continuity even during challenging periods. VTI's broader exposure includes companies with varying dividend sustainability profiles. While the fund benefits from the same large-cap dividend payers as VOO, it also includes smaller companies that may have less predictable dividend policies. Some smaller companies may offer higher yields but face greater risk of dividend cuts during economic downturns, while others may pay no dividends at all, focusing instead on growth investments. Sector exposure impacts dividend reliability differently for each fund. VOO's slightly higher weighting in technology stocks, which traditionally pay lower dividends, may result in lower overall yield but potentially higher dividend growth as these companies mature. VTI's broader sector exposure includes more traditional dividend-paying sectors but also encompasses growth-oriented sectors where dividend payments may be less prioritized, creating a more complex dividend sustainability profile. Cost considerations play a crucial role in long-term investment performance, with both funds offering exceptionally low expense ratios that minimize the impact of fees on returns. VTI charges an expense ratio of 0.03%, and VOO maintains an identical 0.03% fee structure. These ultra-low costs reflect Vanguard's commitment to providing cost-effective index investing solutions and represent significant advantages over actively managed alternatives. Tax efficiency represents another important consideration for taxable account investors. Both funds demonstrate excellent tax efficiency through their index-based strategies and Vanguard's management approach. VTI's broader diversification and lower turnover rate of 4% compared to typical actively managed funds helps minimize taxable distributions. The fund's structure allows for efficient tax management through in-kind redemptions and careful portfolio management practices. VOO similarly demonstrates strong tax efficiency characteristics, with its focus on S&P 500 companies providing stable, predictable holdings that require minimal trading activity. Both funds typically generate most of their taxable distributions through qualified dividends rather than capital gains, providing favorable tax treatment for most investors. The funds' similar tax efficiency profiles mean that cost considerations alone are unlikely to drive investment decisions between these two options. Understanding how VTI and VOO perform across various market conditions provides crucial insights for investors seeking to optimize their portfolio allocation based on economic expectations and market outlook. Historical analysis reveals distinct performance patterns that can help guide investment decisions during different market environments. During bull market periods, the performance differential between VTI and VOO often depends on which market segments lead the advance. When small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, VTI typically demonstrates superior returns due to its broader market exposure. This outperformance can be particularly pronounced during the early stages of economic recoveries when smaller companies benefit from improving business conditions and increased risk appetite among investors. Technology sector performance significantly influences both funds during bull markets, though VOO's slightly higher technology weighting can amplify gains when tech stocks lead market advances. Historical analysis shows that during sustained bull markets, both funds tend to perform similarly over extended periods, with short-term performance differences often evening out as market cycles progress. VTI's broader exposure may provide additional upside during periods of broad-based market strength when smaller companies participate fully in market gains. Growth expectations during bull markets often favor VTI's approach, as smaller companies typically offer higher growth potential compared to their large-cap counterparts. This growth premium can translate into superior returns during optimistic market periods when investors are willing to pay higher valuations for growth prospects. However, VOO's focus on established companies can provide more sustainable gains during later stages of bull markets when quality and profitability become more important than pure growth potential. Bear market performance reveals more significant differences between these funds' risk characteristics. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides better defensive characteristics during market downturns, as larger companies often possess stronger balance sheets and more diversified revenue streams that help them weather economic storms. These companies also tend to have better access to capital markets and more established relationships with lenders, providing additional financial flexibility during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure can amplify losses during bear markets, particularly when small- and mid-cap stocks experience disproportionate declines. Smaller companies often face greater liquidity constraints, higher borrowing costs and more concentrated business risks that can lead to more severe price declines during economic contractions. This vulnerability can result in VTI experiencing deeper drawdowns compared to VOO during significant market stress periods. Recovery patterns following bear markets often favor VTI's broader exposure, as smaller companies may rebound more dramatically once economic conditions improve. However, this recovery potential comes with the trade-off of potentially experiencing more severe initial declines. VOO's more stable large-cap focus may provide better downside protection but potentially slower recovery rates compared to the broader market exposure offered by VTI. Choosing between VTI and VOO requires careful consideration of individual investment objectives, risk tolerance and portfolio context. Risk tolerance alignment is a crucial factor, with VTI's broader market exposure potentially suiting investors who are comfortable with additional volatility in exchange for more comprehensive market participation. Conservative investors or those approaching retirement may find VOO's large-cap focus more appropriate for their stability requirements. Time horizon considerations also influence fund selection decisions. Longer investment horizons may favor VTI's broader diversification, as extended periods allow investors to benefit from the full spectrum of market opportunities while weathering short-term volatility. Shorter time horizons might benefit from VOO's more stable large-cap focus, which can provide more predictable performance patterns over limited periods. Portfolio context plays an important role in fund selection, particularly for investors holding other investments alongside their core equity allocation. Investors with existing small-cap exposure through other funds might prefer VOO to avoid overweighting smaller companies, while those seeking comprehensive market exposure through a single fund might favor VTI's total market approach. The choice often depends on overall portfolio construction strategy and the role each fund plays within the broader investment framework. Financial analysts and investment professionals generally view both VTI and VOO favorably, recognizing their roles as core portfolio holdings for different investor types. Many experts appreciate VTI's comprehensive market coverage, noting its ability to provide complete U.S. equity exposure through a single, low-cost investment vehicle. This total market approach receives praise for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing broad market returns without requiring investors to make complex allocation decisions between different market segments. VOO receives similar expert endorsement for its focus on quality large-cap companies and its role as a stable core holding. Analysts often recommend VOO for investors seeking predictable large-cap exposure without the additional volatility associated with smaller companies. The fund's track record and its benchmark's long history of representing the core of the U.S. stock market contribute to its widespread professional acceptance and recommendation. Bottom Line VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. VTI provides broader diversification through total market exposure, potentially offering superior long-term returns at the cost of increased volatility from small- and mid-cap holdings. VOO focuses on large-cap stability and quality, providing more predictable performance with potentially lower upside during periods favoring smaller companies. The choice between these funds ultimately depends on individual risk tolerance, investment timeline, and preference for comprehensive market exposure versus focused large-cap stability. Both represent solid core holdings that can serve as foundation investments for well-diversified portfolios.

Title: An Unsuspecting Contender - Rocky Mountain's Instinct Powerplay SL Long-Term Review
URL: https://www.vitalmtb.com/product/guide/e-bikes/rocky-mountain/instinct-powerplay-sl-67636
Time Published: 2025-07-12T14:05:13Z
Full Content:
Rocky Mountain isn't a brand many riders would expect to develop its own cutting-edge e-bike technology. But back in 2009, they did just that, launching Propulsion Powercycle division under the same roof as their Quebec HQ. When they introduced their first model, the Altitude Powerplay, in 2017, the proprietary 108Nm Dyname 3.0 motor quietly took the top spot as the most powerful Class 1 e-bike motor. A title that was only recently relinquished to DJI's latest Avinox system. Seven years later, Rocky Mountain has once again pushed the limits of e-bikes with the 2025 Instinct Powerplay SL—their first delve into the lightweight e-bike category. The Powerplay SL offers 65Nm of torque and 550W of power, combined with a 480Wh battery, in a sub-45 lb package. Progressive suspension, adjustable geometry, and size-specific chainstays position the Instinct Powerplay SL as a capable all-rounder. Six months of testing later, let's get into how Rocky's first lightweight e-model performed and where it stands amongst the deep field of SL bikes. When Rocky Mountain unveiled the Dyname 4.0 motor on the Powerplay Lineup in 2021, there were no major performance gains over the then-four-year-old Dyname 3.0 system. Instead, Rocky focused on refining the system, packing it into a smaller space, reducing noise, and significantly cutting weight by over 15%, all while still delivering class-leading torque and power. This led some riders to wonder what it would look like if Rocky were ever to direct that effort at the SL e-bike category. Three years later, we have the answer. Rocky Mountain built on the lessons learned from the full-sized Dyname motors and synthesized them into the Dyname S4 Lite, a 65Nm, 550W motor that weighs only 5 lbs, available exclusively on the 145mm travel Instinct Powerplay SL. Coming in at only 43 lbs, the Instinct Powerplay SL fits comfortably into the SL e category, which seems to capture everything between 38 and 45 lbs, and does so with more battery and significantly more power than most other options. Size-specific chainstays and shock tunes, a reach-adjust headset, and adjustable geometry suggest that Rocky Mountain isn't just interested in mimicking the weight of a normal bike, but the ride experience as well. Like the rest of the Powerplay lineup, the Instinct SL uses a mid-pivot, four-bar suspension layout and a counter-rotating upper rocker link. Though Rocky has not published much about their kinematics, one can expect a good amount of leverage progression, somewhat neutral anti-rise, high anti-squat, and a small amount of rearward wheel path. An integrated, removable battery surrounded by internal guide tubes for all cables and wires rounds out the basic features. The Instinct Powerplay SL is available in three full-carbon builds, ranging from $7,999 to $11,999, in addition to three aluminum builds priced from $5,499 to $7,999. We tested the Carbon 90 build, which came loaded with FOX Factory suspension, a full Race Face Era kit, handling wheels, bars, and cranks, SRAM Code Ultimate Stealth brakes, and an X0 Eagle Transmission drivetrain. Unlike most e-bikes, the Instinct Powerplay SL uses a BB92 pressfit bottom bracket and traditional cranks. Carbon and aluminum models share the same Dyname S4 Lite motor, integrated display, and geometry adjustments. The Dyname S4 Lite has five modes: Walk, Eco, Trail, Trail+, and Ludicrous. The motor can store three different power presets: Factory, Tune A, and Tune B. Tune A and B are adjustable with options to increase or decrease the assist for each mode, represented as a percentage. There is also a boost setting to configure how sensitive the motor is to rider inputs, which has five modes ranging from -2 (least sensitive, 'heavy workout') to +2 (most sensitive, 'low effort'). All motor configuration takes place on the display and with the mode selector switch. Personally, not having to download or open an app whenever I want to adjust the assist or see the odometer is a huge plus. You can even cycle through all three motor tunes and customize them without stopping. The Instinct SL features adjustable reach via included offset headset cups and adjustable head angle, bottom bracket height, and seat angle via the RIDE-4 chips in the upper shock link. Unlike its analog counterpart, the Instinct Powerplay SL does not feature an adjustable chainstay length. I did not make use of the +/-5mm adjustable reach, but as someone who grew up with chronic small bike syndrome, I appreciated having the option. RIDE-4 is a simplified version of Rocky's near-extinct RIDE-9 adjustment. It offers four geometry settings, taking the head angle from 63.5° to 64.2° and raising the bottom bracket about a centimeter. Four settings to change the head angle by 0.7 ° is excessive, but again, I appreciated having the option. I spent most of my time with the bike in position 3, the second highest/steepest. Allegedly, a mullet link will be available in the future and will be compatible with the SM-XL frames. Assembling the bike was straightforward and pain-free. Home mechanics that opt to have the bike delivered can expect to install the handlebar, front brake, front wheel, and battery, as well as run the cable, and cut the housing for the dropper post. The housing is already run through the frame, and the SRAM Transmission drivetrain is already paired and adjusted. All cables are internally routed with individual guide tubes that end at the base of the battery for easy access. Battery fitment is thoughtful, as it glides past the motor and is secured with two bolts. Aside from swapping out the 20mm rise Race Face Era Carbon handlebar for a more appropriate 40mm version, and eventually the EXO+ MaxxTerra Minion DHF for a DoubleDown MaxxGrip High Roller, the bike was left stock for the duration of the test. Motor Performance The Instinct SL was my first experience with the Dyname motor. Having spent extensive time on TQ's HPR50 and around Specialized's SL 1.2, the S4 Lite motor produced a noise level comparable to that of the HPR50. It does a good job of disappearing into the background with practically no whining or whirring. However, the S4 Lite has a persistent, unpleasant grinding that stems from the motor's integrated upper pulleys. Dyname's motors utilize two pulley wheels that sit above the chainring. One pulley serves as a traditional high-pivot idler, neutralizing chain forces from the suspension. The other monitors the tension between the chainring and pulley, telling the motor how much power to deliver. Both are protected by a small plastic cover that serves to keep out the elements and keep the chain secure on the idler. The pulleys are rough enough that the first ride around the neighborhood actually left a tingling sensation in my feet from the vibrations being transmitted through the pedals. They did wear in fairly quickly, to the point that I stopped noticing it after the first few rides. But the noise never went away and was audible to those around me when cruising on smooth pavement. When pedaling, the S4 Lite responds proportionately to rider input, all the way down to zero input. Unlike TQ's less powerful HPR50, where there seems to be a floor of minimum assistance, the S4 Lite has no such floor—give the motor very little and very little assistance you shall receive in return. This form of power delivery does come with a consequence: resting your foot on the pedal while stopped kills power to the motor and triggers an alert that the motor will eventually need to be re-calibrated. Simply unweighting the pedal is enough to get the power back, and re-calibration is a one button procedure handled through the onboard display, but that didn’t make it any less annoying. The S4 Lite also had an interesting flaw where the pulley noise and vibration would become increasingly worse as assist or RPM decreased. Pedaling at a low RPM with minimum assistance turned the grinding into an unpleasant clunking that was quite distracting. That quirk, alongside the fact that pedaling mountain bikes with your own legs is hard, discouraged me from dropping the assist below Trail+ (the third-highest assist level). The Instinct SL does have a relatively generous 480Wh battery, dwarfing the 360Wh and 320Wh batteries found on Trek's Fuel EXe and Specialized's SL models and just edging out the 430Wh battery found on Fazua's Ride 60 system. I never experienced any range anxiety. The 480Wh battery even allowed me to complete a 5,000 ft day without ever using Eco mode. The available Overtime 2.0 Range Extender can take the Instinct SL up to a massive 794Wh, which should cover the needs of 99.9% of riders. The Power offered by the motor is exceptional. With a peak power of 550W, the S4 Lite is within spitting distance of many current full-size e-bikes, including Shimano's EP801, which maxes out at 600W. I could join full-size e-bikes on trail climbs and keep up fairly well, though I would expect to get dropped on a sustained fire road climb. Climbing Performance Like most E-bikes ought to be, climbing the Instinct SL is nearly effortless. Its overall low weight, bolstered by EXO+ tires and the carbon Race Face Era wheels, made for a bike that gets up to speed quickly and has no problem maneuvering technical climbs. The 658mm top tube of the XL Instinct was plenty roomy for my 6'2" stature, though I would have happily traded a centimeter or two to bring the seat tube angle up to 79° from 77° as the front of the bike had a tendency to wander on steeper climbs. The rear shock did sink deeper into its travel than I would prefer on technical or rough climbs, leaving me vulnerable to pedal strikes. This occurred with 25% sag. The Float X shock does feature a climb switch, but I found it too firm to be all that useful on anything but roads. Closing the low-speed compression helped, but it made the shock spike on square-edge hits when descending. Ultimately, I ran the shock over-sprung to help mitigate pedal strikes and dealt with the consequences otherwise. Descending As soon as I dropped into my first downhill aboard the Instinct SL, it was apparent just how long and balanced the geometry felt. Even when diving into steep corners, I found it easy to keep my weight over the front wheel while maintaining a neutral and upright body position. I had no trouble maneuvering the XL Instinct's 1306mm wheelbase around tight corners, either. The centered riding position made it effortless to unweight the rear wheel without getting the sensation of being in front of the front axle. I attribute this, in part, to the 450mm chainstays found on the L and XL. While 450mm is not huge, that number should start to approach 460mm at sag, thanks to the Instinct's mid-pivot design, contributing to a neutral body position. I would like to see larger jumps between sizes, a la Forbidden, but nonetheless, it beats the hell out of the 430mm chainstays found on most other XL SL e-bikes. The second thing I noticed was the unbalanced compression damping between the fork and shock. Even with Rocky Mountain's size-specific shock tunes, the fork had a noticeably more damped feel than the shock. On longer sections, I would feel my weight progressively shift backward after repeated compressions, requiring a conscious 'reset' to get back in the middle of the bike. I think this could be resolved with a firmer high-speed compression tune on the shock to better match the race feel of the Grip X2 36. I could probably get a more balanced feel by backing off the HSC on the fork, and putting in some volume spacers to maintain the bottom out resistance, but I think I'd be holding the bike back in terms of its descent capabilities. The only time I felt the bike took focus to ride was when resisting front wheel deflections. I found the Grip X2 Fox 36 to not track great over baby head rocks or angled square edge hits. I was able to mitigate this somewhat by replacing the EXO+ casing front tire with a heavier and softer DoubleDown, improving the material damping at the front of the bike. Still, the firm damping of the X2 that encouraged me to take the roughest of straight lines also demanded focus to not get caught out. At $12,000, one would expect the Instinct SL's parts spec not to leave one wanting, and that's mostly the case. The Race Face carbon wheels and cranks performed admirably without issue, the FOX Factory suspension was reliable, and I smashed the X0 Eagle derailleur so hard that I actually heard it move out of the way by like six gears, then reset back in place unaffected. Some riders may prefer heavier casing tires than the EXO+ featured across all build kits. I found them to be plenty durable for my needs, brushing off rock strikes and knife edges that would have ended an EXO casing tire's career. I'm less jazzed about the MaxxTerra compound used for both tires. It's passable for a rear tire but bordering on hazardous as a front tire. I would like to see a firmer tune on the rear shock as well as a rolling change to the new and improved FOX 36 to address the deflection issues I was having. The only component that degraded was the FOX Transfer post, which started getting sticky after just a few rides, struggling to reach full extension. Finally, I had no issues with the SRAM Codes that came on this bike, but in a world where Mavens exist, I'd like to see Mavens spec'd in the future. $12,000 is a lot of money to spend on a bike, yet somehow the C90 build that was tested is somewhere between average and above average value for the money. An equivalent build of Trek's Fuel EXe will set you back an additional $1,200. The $9,699 Carbon 70 build trades the Factory Grip X2 Suspension for Performance Elite Grip X, retains wireless shifting in the form of GX Transmission, downgrades to Code Silver brakes, and still comes in at a respectable 43.5 lbs. Of all of Rocky Mountain's offerings, the C70 is the one I would choose as a customer. At this price point, the equivalent Fuel EXe 9.8 T-Type comes spec'd with RockShox Select+ suspension and Code R brakes, which I feel is a real performance sacrifice. For me, the heart of the Powerplay SL is the low weight and high power, and while the C50 build does retain that at only 44 lbs, the RockShox Select Suspension, XT brakes, and Novatec wheels diminish the value of the low weight and power. Rocky Mountain does offer a range of aluminum builds, but I have a hard time rationalizing the build kits for anyone looking for solid downhill performance out of the box. The Alloy 70 BC Edition comes in at $8,000 fitted with Select+ suspension, Code Bronze brakes, GX Eagle Transmission, and a weight penalty to the tune of 48.5 lbs. For $200 less, a customer could roll away with a top of the line Commencal Meta Power SX 400 with Factory Grip X2 suspension, SRAM Code brakes, and a much less finicky Bosch SX motor, for practically the same weight. I spent several months on the Instinct SL and never had to tighten so much as a bolt or spoke. An included extra downtube guard should provide any necessary protection on shuttle days, and the motor showed no signs of degenerative wear, including the pulley wheels, despite creaking that suggested otherwise. The reach-adjust headset cup did produce some noise after a few rides. I was initially concerned when I pulled on the headset cup, and it came out by hand, but then I noticed the cup had an O-ring around it, meaning it was likely functioning as intended. I greased up the seal and the frame/cup interface and the noise went away. For a certain subset of riders, the pressfit BB92 bottom bracket will be a turn-off, but I have never had an issue with one. Given Rocky Mountain's financial situation, I would have concerns about being able to find service parts or fulfill a warranty if they were to shut their doors, however, the Instinct Powerplay SL gave no indication that the warranty would be needed. It's also worth mentioning that Dyname has recently updated their website, stating they are no longer exclusive to Rocky Mountain, and are looking for new partners, hinting at some continued motor support should Rocky Mountain close down. Despite the Dyname motor's rough-around-the-edges feeling, I had a blast riding the Instinct Powerplay SL. Progressive geometry, a ton of power, light overall weight, and solid range had me reaching for the bike as much as I could. Perhaps not quite a quiver killer, the Instinct SL held it down under a wide range of trails. It would not be my first choice if I were planning on spending a lot of time at bike parks, however, I'm confident it's up to the task. While I would struggle to encourage anyone to spend $12,000 on any bike, let alone one with the motor issues I encountered, the lower-priced builds can offer more value at a similar weight with specs that should cover most riders' needs, especially those less fussy about suspension performance. If you are searching for a lightweight eMTB that will let you nearly keep up with your friends on full-power bikes without compromising on geometry or riding experience, I would suggest being open to the Instinct Powerplay SL.

Title: Nvidia’s $4 Trillion Valuation Tells A Beautiful Retirement Story

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia’s valuation reached the $4 trillion mark this week, while co-founder Jensen Huang’s shares are now worth something like $143 billion. Present and future retirees should rejoice the rapidly increasing wealth inequality that Nvidia and Huang represent. That’s because inequality is the greatest gift to retirement of all. To see why, contemplate the “Magnificent Seven” stocks known to be the biggest drivers of the bull market of the present. Doing so requires a brief look backwards. If you purchased Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia early, you’re presently not worried about having enough money for retirement. Huang was of course at Nvidia in the beginning, and his enormous wealth exists as evidence of what can happen when early investors or employees stay the proverbial course amid immense share-price volatility. Twice in Nvidia’s public life its shares have dropped 90 percent on their way to gains greater than 300,000% to the present. That has been the norm among corporations that make up the Magnificent 7. Lots of ups and downs that the typical retail investor saving for retirement can’t endure. Which is the point. Thanks to index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, or for that matter global stock market indices, retirement savers don’t have to be early to transformative business concepts. Much more importantly, they don’t have to pick the shares that will eventually soar. Instead, they merely need to be invested. From there the stock market will not only do their worrying for them, their investment in broad indices ensures that they’ll have growing exposure to the very few corporations that unexpectedly emerge as the bluest of blue chips. That’s why present and future retirees should cheer rising inequality. Exactly because index funds and ETFs are frequently market-cap weighted, ownership of stock indexes evolves to reflect the most highly valued stocks most prominently. That’s where wealth inequality comes in. It’s an effect of entrepreneurs discovering a future of commerce that most never imagined. Since entrepreneurs are much earlier to world-changing and improving ideas than the markets themselves, they capture the majority of market gains from their discovery of what was only obvious after the fact. Still, would-be retirees once again don’t need to be early. They just need to be positioned for exposure to the high-flyers of today and tomorrow through broad market exposure. If so, as in if and when the next commercial visionary happens on a new idea that investors gradually fall in love with, the typical retirement investor stands to prosper substantially thanks to the genius of compounding. The good news is that the potential to compound one’s wealth grows by the day as the world shrinks by the day through commercial advances that reach greater and greater numbers of people. This is wealth inequality, and it’s transforming the quality of retirement for the much better.

Title: 6 Best Bank Stocks To Watch As 2008 Financial Crisis Rules Are Eased

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. If regulators ease capital requirements as proposed, financial institutions will have more balance ... More sheet freedom to make loans or fund other growth opportunities. Deregulation is a theme of the Trump administration, and bank stocks may soon benefit. In June 2025, regulators proposed a change to a 2014 rule enacted after the 2008 Financial Crisis. If approved, the update could free up capital for banks and financial companies to pursue growth. Let's review which banking rules are changing, and meet six bank stocks most likely to benefit. The 2008 Financial Crisis rules are U.S. regulatory changes enacted after several major U.S. financial companies failed in 2008. The failures contributed to a historic U.S. recession and a European debt crisis. The legislative reforms aimed to prevent similar economic crises from happening again. The rules that may be eased in 2025 involve capital requirements. Capital includes cash and easily sold assets that can absorb losses and fund debt repayments. Regulators specify how much capital financial institutions must have relative to their debts. These requirements help to ensure financial stability and solvency through economic downturns. Up for modification is the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR). Under current rules, the largest U.S. banks must have an eSLR of 5%. Proposed changes would lower that requirement to 3.5% to 4.25% at the big banks, depending on their risk profile. Other rules governing long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity would be updated to align with the new eSLR threshold. Proponents say the changes will increase banks' participation in Treasury markets, promote lending and boost the economy. Detractors argue that easing the eSLR and related requirements will increase the chances of bank failures. The table below highlights six large, globally important bank stocks that may soon see a reduction in their eSLR requirement. You may want to add these to your own list of best stocks for 2025. A review of each financial company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Citigroup by the numbers: Citigroup operates through five businesses: services, markets, banking and international, wealth and U.S. personal banking. The first three cater to corporate and institutional clients and the last two serve consumers. Citigroup has a strong institutional client roster plus 70 million personal banking clients. The bank has physical locations in 94 countries and operates in nearly 180 countries. Last year, Citigroup was wrapping up a broad restructuring effort that trimmed its workforce by about 10%. Staff reductions and other cost-cutting efforts helped the company deliver 2024 net income of $12.7 billion, up 37% from the year before. In the first quarter of 2025, Citigroup reported a 5% quarter-over-quarter decline in operating expenses—showing continued cost discipline. The bank also reported revenue growth in all five of its businesses. Citigroup’s financial position remains strong. At the end of the first quarter, the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) was 13.4%. The CET1 ratio is the bank's core capital—primarily ordinary shares and retained earnings—as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The ratio measures financial resilience. Higher is better. The minimum CET1 ratio regulators require varies by institution. Citigroup's minimum is 12.1%. The Bank of New York Mellon by the numbers: BK is the holding company for Bank of New York Mellon or BNY. BNY is America's oldest bank and a specialist in custodial services. Custodian banks safeguard securities for their customers. BNY customers include Fortune 100 companies, governments and pension plans. BK launched an enterprise-wide AI effort in 2023. The strategy led to the creation of an in-house AI platform that BK employees use for risk management, operational efficiency and predictive trade analytics. The bank’s digital transformation has been good for business. In 2023 and 2024, BK increased net income by 29% and 37%, respectively. In the same years, EPS grew 35% and 49% with help from BK's generous share repurchase activity. Share repurchases totaled $2.6 billion in 2023 and $3.1 billion in 2024. First quarter highlights included revenue growth of 6% and diluted EPS growth of 26% from the prior-year quarter. The bank’s CET1 ratio was 11.5%. Also notable is BK's dividend program. The financial company has raised its dividend annually by at least 9% over the last three years. The current annual payout is $1.88, for a yield of 2%. State Street Corporation by the numbers: State Street is a large custodian bank that provides investment servicing solutions for institutional investors. The company's AI-enabled Alpha platform helps investors manage their assets and make data-driven decisions. State Street also offers ETFs and mutual funds through its State Street Investment Management business, formerly known as SSGA. State Street’s stock price is up nearly 12.5% for the year, after being down 25% in early April. Several analysts expect the gains to continue. Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo, Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs and Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley, among others, raised their STT price targets in July. Acquisitions and partnerships have contributed to the optimism. International transactions, including the purchase of Mizuho Financial Group’s global custody business, provide access to new growth markets for STT. Partnerships like the strategic relationship with Ray Dalio's hedge fund Bridgewater Associates support new offerings for existing customers. State Street's first quarter earnings show progress on revenue and expenses. Total revenue was up 5% and fee revenue gained 6%. Expenses declined 3%. EPS rose 49% to $2.04. At quarter-end, State Street's CET1 ratio was 11%, down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Bank of America by the numbers: Bank of America provides banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses in the U.S. and more than 35 countries. The bank is the largest small business lender domestically and has been ranked in the top three for global investment banking fees and global research. At least six analysts have raised their price targets on BAC since early June. The consensus second quarter EPS outlook is $0.87, which represents 4.8% growth from last year. For the first quarter, BAC reported 6% revenue growth, 3% net interest income growth, 3% growth in average deposit balances and 4% higher average loans and leases. Notably, it was the seventh consecutive quarter the bank increased average deposits. Diluted EPS was $0.90, up from $0.76 in the prior-year quarter. At quarter-end, the bank’s CET1 ratio was 11.8%. Bank of America pays a quarterly dividend of $0.26, for a yield of 2.2%. The bank also approved a $25 billion share repurchase program last year. Share repurchases in the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion. Goldman Sachs by the numbers: Goldman Sachs is organized into three businesses: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Global Banking & Markets, the largest segment, provides investment banking services. Asset & Wealth Management manages money for institutions, advisors, foundations and high-net-worth individuals. Platform Solutions offers embedded financial products and a transaction banking platform. Goldman Sachs has been making moves to leverage its expertise and reputation in investment banking and trading operations. Last year, the financial company sold a credit card business, home-improvement lending operation and personal financial management unit. First quarter 2025 results indicate the refocus is driving results. The company earned $15 billion in net revenue, its third-highest quarterly sales result. The Global Banking & Markets business contributed $10.7 billion to that tally, partly due to record net revenues in Equities. GS also earned the top global ranking for announced and completed mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings. Diluted EPS in the first quarter was $14.12, 22% higher than the prior-year quarter. GS also spent $4.6 billion on common share repurchases and authorized a new $40 billion repurchase program. The financial company's CET1 ratio is currently 14.83%, 1.23 percentage points higher than its required level. Morgan Stanley by the numbers: Morgan Stanley is a wealth manager serving institutions, governments and consumers. The company offers investment banking services to businesses and governments, sales and trading support to hedge funds and active investment management services to people and institutions. Morgan Stanley also publishes investment research. Morgan Stanley has two primary longer-term goals: to increase client assets to $10 trillion from $7.7 trillion currently, and to realize a 30% pre-tax margin in its Wealth Management business. The Wealth Management growth strategy involves acquiring new customers from ETrade, workplace channels and financial advisors. The three-pronged approach has been effective. Since 2018, Morgan Stanley has increased the number of households served by 20 million, from 2.5 million to 22.5 million. The momentum is one reason why analysts expect the financial company to report EPS of $2.01 for the second quarter, up from $1.82 in last year’s June quarter. First quarter 2025 highlights for Morgan Stanley included quarter-over-quarter net revenue growth of 17% and diluted EPS growth of 29%. The Wealth Management pretax margin was 26.6% and the CET1 ratio at quarter-end was 15.3%. Morgan Stanley also spent $1 billion on stock repurchases in the quarter and declared a $0.925 quarterly dividend. Bottom Line If regulators ease capital requirements as proposed, financial institutions will have more balance sheet freedom to make loans or fund other growth opportunities. The freedom does bring higher risk, so lean into banks with disciplined leadership teams and conservative lending practices.

Title: Google Search is under attack. Why ChatGPT won’t overthrow it yet.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. While ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has positioned it to rival to traditional search engines, analysts say the chatbot hasn’t knocked Google out of the top spot just yet. Citi Research analysts led by Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating and $203 target price on shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent, on Friday. The stock was down slightly at $177.18 in morning trading. Citi polled 2,400 Google Search users in the U.S. and found that the search engine “remains core to most users’ Internet usage." The same conclusion held true across all age groups, Citi said. Still, the bank cited a rise in “alternative search experiences" among young users, naming ChatGPT and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram as examples. ChatGPT has become the “go-to" destination for younger users, with Google usage rising with age, Citi said. While 85% of respondents selected Google as their “core search engine," with 72% saying Google was their first site to search online, differences emerged among age groups. Among users aged 41 to 55, 88% of respondents named Google as their core search engine, but that number dipped to 83% for respondents aged 14 to 24. With that being said, the use of AI agents appears to be “more research-driven than commercial," as opposed to Google Search, where shopping was ranked as the top use case among respondents, Citi said. And the bank believes there’s more to love about Google’s growth story, as responses indicated that the use of other features such as Shopping and Travel continued to accelerate. Overall, the results suggest that Google Search is standing its ground for now, which is good news for Alphabet. Revenue attributed to Google Search and other services accounted for more than half of the total in the latest quarter. Google is set to report second-quarter results on July 23. Based on Citi’s preliminary analysis, “we believe the broader online advertising environment, including search and YouTube, is healthy," the analysts wrote. Other firms have sounded the alarm about AI and its effects on Google Search. However, Citi believes the search engine’s advertising market improved throughout the quarter. Earnings will put that theory to the test. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Title: AI automation slashes 25 percent of entry-level tech jobs; half of junior roles at risk

Layoffs at firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have sharply focused on artificial intelligence as a catalyst for workforce reduction. Executives admit that automation will trim head counts in coming years, leaving many employees unsure whether experience offers better protection. Some predict that entry-level staff will be first to go because their routine duties automate easily; Anthropic’s chief executive even warned that half of all junior white-collar roles could disappear within five years. Others argue that older, well-paid employees who rely on long-established workflows are more exposed, especially if they fail to adapt. Early field data points toward pressure on newcomers. ADP payroll figures show employment for workers with less than two years’ tenure in computing roles fell about a quarter after peaking in 2023. Customer service jobs follow the same pattern. A temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy produced similar data: junior coders finished tasks slightly faster. However, mid-level developers used the tool to oversee peers and work across unfamiliar languages, raising their overall value. The threat to seasoned professionals is real, however. AI systems can now draft legal briefs and write production code, eroding the premium once attached to deep domain expertise. Law firms that deploy generative models report using roughly half as many contract attorneys and major tech companies continue to cut experienced managers and engineers while betting heavily on automation. As companies hire mostly junior workers boosted by AI and a handful of senior overseers, mid-level roles could disappear. That shift would shrink tax revenues and put more strain on unemployment benefits and other support programs. Lawmakers are already looking at ways to retrain displaced staff and make sure everyone shares in AI’s productivity gains. NY Times (in English)
