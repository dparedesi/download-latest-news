There was drama in the top of the table clash in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League as Terenure College won the D6W derby against St Mary’s College 14-12 in a tense, tactical affair at Lakelands. Tries from John McKee and Oisín McCormack, both converted by Chris Cosgrave, gave Nure just enough breathing room to survive four Mick O’Gara penalties. Defending champions Clontarf picked up a 17-3 win away to Cork Constitution at Temple Hill in a repeat of last season’s decider. Fionn Gilbert’s brace, one in each half, proved the catalyst, Conor Kelly added two conversions and a penalty. Con’s sole reply came from an Aidan Moynihan penalty deep in the first half. UCD climbed out of the drop zone with a 34-12 bonus-point win over Young Munster in Belfield. A quickfire Evan Moynihan double before half-time set the tone, and second-half tries from Michael O’Reilly, Dan Barron, and Daniel Hurley pushed the Students comfortably clear. Lansdowne surged to a 36-11 victory at Old Belvedere. Andy Marks and Bobby Sheehan both crossed twice, with George Morris adding a fifth try deep into stoppage time. Charlie Tector contributed five conversions and a penalty from the tee. Belvo stayed in sight during the first half through Daragh O’Dwyer’s penalties and an Andre Ryan try, but couldn’t contain Lansdowne in the second half. Ballynahinch impressed again in a 24-3 win away to Nenagh Ormond, scoring twice in each half with Tom McAllister, Aaron Sexton, Bradley Luney and Sam Warwick all crossing for tries In Division 1B, Garryowen produced a strong second-half push to win 29-15 away to City of Armagh, with Fionn Rowsome grabbing a clinical hat-trick. Instonians turned things around late on to defeat Highfield 17-15, while Naas overturned a half-time deficit to beat Blackrock College 32-20. Leaders Old Wesley overcame rivals Trinity 30-16, while UCC got their first win of the season, defeating Queen’s 27-12. There were narrow wins for Banbridge, MU Barnhall, and Corinthians in Division 2A, Ballymena staged a remarkable comeback from 17-0 down at the half to beat Cashel 29–23, while Shannon ground out a valuable 10–7 victory at Greystones. In 2B, Galwegians delivered an empathetic 43-21 win against UL Bohemian in their top of the table clash, Clogher Valley struck twice late on to beat Enniscorthy, while Skerries also struck late against Buccaneers to win 25-23. Malone claimed a strong 35-19 win at Sligo, while Rainey picked up a valuable 19-10 away win against Navan In 2C, Monkstown once again came out on top against Ballyclare, winning 43-34 in a high-scoring affair, Belfast Harlequins held off Midleton, Clonmel ended Thomond’s unbeaten start, Malahide recorded their first win of the season, while Bective Rangers picked up a win away to Dolphin, 20 years after their last meeting ended in defeat. In the Energia All-Ireland Junior Cup quarter-finals, Athy, Creggs and Dromore all booked their place in the semi-final, while Seapoint and Wicklow will meet in two weeks to determine who joins them, as their game was postponed due to the rainfall. In the Women’s Division, holders UL Bohemian held off a spirited Galwegians side 36-24 to move top and remain unbeaten, with Chloe Pearse crossing for a hat-trick. Blackrock continued their winning form with a 60-5 win over Tullow. Robyn O’Connor crossed for four tries as Old Belvedere defeated Ballincollig 65-7 in another statement win, while Railway Union were sharp in a 48-7 success over Wicklow, Heidi Lyons and Claire Boles crossing for braces. Ennis returned to winning ways defeating Cooke 22-19 thanks to a sensational four-try performance from Aoibhín Donnelly.

Nino Paoli is a Dow Jones News Fund fellow at Fortune on the News desk. Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcast At Your Service. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Former ‘Good Morning America’ Host Joan Lunden on Distrust of the Media and AI Deepfakes: ‘A Really Sad State of Affairs’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/joan-lunden-ai-deepfake-news-trust-good-morning-america-1236581678/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Antonio Ferme Joan Lunden, the veteran journalist who co-anchored “Good Morning America” from 1980 to 1997, doesn’t mince her concerns about the current media landscape. “I think it’s a really sad state of affairs that a very big segment of the American population doesn’t know what to believe anymore,” Lunden told Variety earlier this month at 50th anniversary celebration of “GMA.’ “There’s so much fake news, videos, pictures. They don’t know whether it’s really you. That part of it makes me incredibly sad and upset. I don’t know if we can put the toothpaste back in the tube.” While “GMA” remains a reliable ratings performer for ABC, more Americans are now getting their news from social media platforms. About half of Americans say they struggle to tell what’s true or not when they get news, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. That confusion mirrors a broader collapse in trust in both news organizations and social platforms — a decline seen across political parties and age groups. Popular on Variety “I wish somehow we could right that ship,” Lunden said. “But with AI, I think we’re going to see losses of jobs in media, just like we’re seeing them in Amazon and everywhere else.” [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed this year’s extensive layoffs to the company’s increased rollout of ‘generative AI and agents.’] After pausing for a moment, Lunden added, “But you know what? They can’t replace a host sitting there in that chair, saying good morning to you in the morning. There’s nothing that can be said for the chemistry of two people on the air.”Outside of AI-generated deepfakes, Lunden was also quick to acknowledge how she’s benefited from the new technologies ushered in since leaving “GMA” in 1997. She recalls feeling siloed from the audience she once greeted at every sunrise.“The hardest part of leaving was disconnecting from the American audience,” she said. “Because there was no social media, it was truly a disconnect. It kind of freaked me out.” That void was eventually filled when she first logged onto social media and reconnected with her old fans. When Lunden was on air, she had “reams of people [on staff] that did nothing but answer letters,” but the direct connection on social media was on a different level. “Pretty soon I had fifty thousand, sixty thousand followers, and my husband said, ‘You cannot be talking to all those people every day.’” She chuckled, “But boy, I give it a try.” The lively “GMA” celebration at Disney’s New York headquarters united Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan with Joan Lunden and fellow veterans Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. The event followed the previous night’s airing of President Trump’s confrontational “60 Minutes” interview, his first since suing CBS over what he described as an altered version of Kamala Harris’ election-season appearance. The timing underscored the increasingly fraught relationship between politics, the press and the billionaire owners now shaping major media companies. “We obviously know that the major networks are little by little all becoming owned by the richest people in the world,” Lunden said. “We don’t want their opinions and their political viewpoints to seep into our business. But I’m a glass half full kind of girl. I really think that the journalism, as an industry, will be able to stand strong. We’ll still be here ten years from now celebrating the 60th anniversary, and you’ll still be able to ask me any question you want.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Time Published: 2025-11-15T14:00:00Z

with intense eagerness since 2012! a channel of the los angeles review of books The 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays ended in elation or devastation, depending on what side of the ball and the 49th parallel you happened to be on. For us–two friends, former colleagues, and Filipino North Americans–the series’ 146 innings across seven games formed a tether of anxious codependency that could have easily toggled over into toxicity and bad blood. Instead, it deepened our mutual love of baseball, a dastardly game of inches (or as Adrian might say, centimeters), fickle momentum, painstaking rituals, and good old fashioned luck. It also reminded us why we each love Los Angeles and Toronto. One is a city besieged by relentless immigration raids against the Latinx fans who love the Dodgers most, putting the city and many of the team’s members at odds with its owner. The other is a city of immigrants from the Global South and elsewhere across the former British empire, held hostage by kleptocrats and landlords, whose sports teams are owned by the very telecommunication monopolies that make everyday life unaffordable. As a way of making sense of it all–the big feelings, the huge hangovers, the agony and the ecstasy, as Howard Cosell used to say–we’ve written an extended chronicle of our remote intimacies through this epic fall classic. It’s a love letter to our teams and our cities, and a glimpse at everything it takes for us, the fans, to help win a World Series. KT: The origins of my Dodgers fandom emerged, as it did for many Angelnxs my age, during peak Fernandomania in the early 1980s. My family immigrated from Manila to Los Angeles in 1983, just as I was about to turn ten-years-old. We landed at LAX in March amidst a catastrophic El Niño that brought a tornado to South Central Los Angeles. The part of me prone to mythologizing would take all the credit for finding my way to the boys in blue, especially Fernando Valenzuela, whose Brown, stocky frame and shaggy hair offered a heroic mirror for my tomboyishness during that era; a fresh-off-the-boat gender trouble that isolated me from the white suburban girls in my Inland Empire subdivision. Because I’d been on the road with my musician parents for the better part of three years, I took Calvert School correspondence courses. Were it not for the tutor my parents hired named Mike Thurman, who suggested I cultivate an interest in baseball to help juice my math lessons and my English writing skills, who knows what would’ve become of me. (My dad loves the Lakers, and prefers basketball to baseball, though he has since evolved into a bigger baseball fan thanks to his kid). My most treasured Dodger relic came to me as a result of Mike’s assignment to write a fan letter to my favorite player asking for an autograph. I picked the great Dominican 3rd baseman and the first Dodger ever to hit 30 homers and steal 20 bases, Pedro Guerrero. Pedro was the hero of the 1981 World Series clinching game 6 against the Yankees, with 5 RBIs and 8 total bases. Cut to forty-two years later and the only Guerrero on everyone’s minds is Toronto’s’ Vladdy, Jr. (no relation to the Dodgers’ Pedro, though he does have a much younger half-brother with the same name who can also ball, according to viral videos on the internet). Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. and the Blue Jays came off the ropes in the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners in 7 games, having been down 0-2 and 3-2, before clinching their World Series berth at home in front of a euphoric Rogers Centre and all of Canada. After cruising through the Wild Card against the Cincinnati Reds, and a taut but efficient NLDS against the favored Phillies, the Dodgers punched their ticket to the World Series with an NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers, the team with the most wins in the regular season. Needless to say, I was anxious AF as the World Series was about to begin. The Dodgers had been loafing around with a week off: plenty of time to get into their own heads before facing the Blue Jays, who just completed the kind of mojo making comeback that carries teams all the way to a championship. I knew Adrian was excited for the Jays’ first World Series appearance since 1993 (before he was born?), and we were communicating largely through Instagram stories and messages. I wasn’t sure how it would play out for either of us, our hometowns, or our friendship. ADL: So I was alive during the Jays’ last World Series, but I was still a kid in Manila! It would not be until 1998 when my family decided to leave our barangay (neighborhood) forever and make the journey across the Pacific. There was, I think, a future in which we could have moved to the US, and I could have been raised a Dodgers, Cubs, or Yankees fan. But for many reasons (like healthcare), we landed in Toronto one rainy Spring night, and bounced around the city’s immigrant and working-class east end of Scarborough. Now I confess – and anyone who knows me can attest to this – that, in terms of sports, my first love is basketball. My dad, who idolized Larry Bird, was a – puke – Celtics fan, and only once did we begrudgingly overlap, when Kevin Garnett won his championship. Outside of the Vince Carter-Tracy McGrady Raptors, I followed a hodgepodge of players, mostly power forwards like Garnett and Tim Duncan (my favorite basketball player of all time after Jimmy Butler). On the playground, everyone wanted to be an Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant, as our frequently-sprained ankles attested. If basketball was the reliable main squeeze, baseball was the secret and passionate affair. And I mean secret, literally. My first baseball game was the first time I ever journeyed to downtown Toronto without my parents (with the blessing of a permission slip, of course). In my second and third (and fourth and fifth, ad nauseam) games, I eschewed bureaucratic approval, and commuted down with friends on the putatively free GO Train, which taught me the exquisite art of fare evasion. What began as the thrill of escaping a Very Catholic Household turned into an odyssey of being chased around the double-decker train by inspectors, sprinting off the train and jetting across Union Station, and snagging the cheap seats paid for by the parents of one of our token white friends, and jeering (and honestly, nervously so) at the Montreal Expos’ all-star designated hitter, Vladimir Guerrero…Senior. But it was the height of the Vince Carter Raptors, and I had no one to talk about how the fear that The Impaler struck into my heart, so MLB became something of an uncool thing to follow in those doldrum years. My fandom would have to be nourished elsewhere. On intramural softball, I was a middling third baseman, tolerated for my decent catch, later prized for my notoriously obstructive wide base (I was and remain a big boy). And, just as a piece of Canadiana for this write-up’s inevitably American audience, as kids, a popular game in gym class (which became intramural and local tournaments) was called Soccer Baseball. It wasn’t until this year that I learned that y’all Americans call it something else: Kickball. Then came 2015. Yes, I’m talking about the greatest and most swaggerific Jays team ever assembled before the 2025 season. Yes, I’m talking about icons Tulo and Pillar, and the imperturbable Donaldson. Yes, I’m talking about the invisible parrot perching on Edwin’s Edwing. Yes, I’m talking about Joey Bats. Yes, I’m talking about The Bat Flip. It is hard to overstate the intra-/inter-/trans-galactic convergences that imbued José Bautista’s iconic moment with the raw energy that exploded throughout the city after the repression of many disappointing years. For this Scarborough kid, that seventh inning was (and to me, remains) the greatest moment in Blue Jays history: tied at two apiece, after a 53-minute inning, Josh Donaldson on first and Kevin Pillar on third, Bautista at bat, one ball and one strike, Sam Dyson threw a fastball, and in the roaring din of the crowd – gone. While the American media was up in arms about the impoliteness (lol) of the gesture, we were passing around screenshots of our Dominican king in the group chats. For the kids from the ends, in other words, Canadian niceness was white people shit. Bautista was who we were, and who we wanted to be, at the same time. To this day, I can still recite the call: Bautista with the drive–Deep left field–NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! A couple of years after the 2015 ALDS, my relationship with my Jays would have to become a long distance one. I was about to move to Honolulu (and then to Seattle) on a Fulbright Scholarship. At my going-away party, one of my best friends surprised me with a Bautista jersey to wear on my sojourns. This is, incidentally, the only photo I have of me in Jays gear before this year. I gave the Bautista jersey to my brother, who still lives in Scarborough, and who wore it for the 2025 season. I know it sounds a little both-sides-ist, but by the time the World Series rolled around, and the Prince That Was Promised, Vladdy Jr. led my hometown team to new heights, I was torn. Half a decade (including the entire pandemic) in Los Angeles, along the esteemed artery of Temple Road that sutures Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Rampart Village into a Filipino enclave, and I had learned to become a Dodgers fan. Or more accurately, it was the deep Echo Park-ness of my former colleagues, especially Karen (superfan of all things Dodgers) and Natalia Molina (neighborhood historian and Los Doyers faithful) and Ana Iwataki (Little Tokyo curatorial nerd and consummate Asian American jock), who situated me in space. Being in that neighborhood, especially during 2020, taught me how to fall in love with Los Angeles. I bought my first car (whom I named Hybrid Jesus), took lockdown joyrides up and down the coast, went on my Stupid Mental Health Walks around the lake, and – most importantly – paraded down Echo Park loaded with cases of beer to hand out on the street. It was the year of the Lakers championship, the Dodgers championship, the presidential elections, and I came to adore the anarchic smell of burning rubber from the pickup trucks doing donuts on Sunset. Once the city “opened back up,” it was Dodgers games over spicy fried chicken at Crawfords, and dancing at Short Stop. Nonetheless. I can’t lie: it felt damn amazing to flaunt my Jays gear in New York, heckled by Public Enemy Number One (Yankees fans) and supported by the Charming Disasters (Mets fans). When Springer hit the homer that clinched our first World Series appearance since my former-non-Canadian ass was eleven months old, it was time to go to war. Even if it was against my other former home city. AdL: Man, I was WORRIED about this one. For a casual fan, it was easy to be optimistic. The Jays were locked in and warmed up, the team Loved Each Other, and they were riding the momentum of an epic ALDS on the back of the heroics of George Springer. But there was so much about the writing on the wall that made me uneasy: it would be Springer’s return to a playoff match against the Dodgers, and I feared (rightly) that the bad karma from the 2017 World Series would be Houston’s chief export to the city of Toronto. Not to mention that at the end of the day, the Jays are still A Toronto Sports Team: infamously unlucky. The perpetual underdog, and deservedly so, because for the most part, our teams tend to suck. I watched the game at the lobby bar of an indie theater in Williamsburg, where my partner was running the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival. With much foresight, she asked the theater to project the game onto the wall above the staircase, and I booked it to Union Square to catch the ironically-named L train, which I had hoped was not premonitory for anything. The theater ebbed and flowed with Brooklyn arts types and queer goths, often both at once, and at the bar, it became clear that I was the outlier sports fan when I was yelling at the wall with a Fernet in hand, long after everyone else had shoved their way into the auditorium. My god, did this game have some great story lines. After his meteoric rise from rookie in the minor leagues to playoff darling, my beautiful Pennsylvanian son (no relation) Trey Yesavage started for the Jays in Game 1. It wasn’t the dominant repeat of his surprise start in G6 of the ALCS, but he managed to hold his own for a respectable four innings. The bartender, who knew nothing about baseball, enthusiastically congratulated me, a Filipino dude in my young thirties, for My White American Son’s (no relation) successes midway through the third. Nights like G1 made me nostalgic for Old Twitter. I’d have been lighting it up across the feed on my old account, Swagapino Studies. Bluesky, the liberal suburb of microblogging platforms would have to do. And pleasantly, it turned out that other Skeeters (yes, that’s the unfortunate and legitimate Bluesky slang) had the same hankering, and on that platform, I found a decent dupe for the dopamine hits of a Night On Twitter. So when, at the bottom of the sixth, with bases loaded, my son (no relation) Addison Barger pinch-hit for Davis Schneider (for whom my partner yells GREAT MOUSTACHE whenever he shows up on screen), I knew what to do. Reader, I skeeted. KT: I didn’t like the vibes heading into game one in Toronto, especially because I had to watch in snippets while I was away at a conference in Houston of all places. Like every true Dodgers fan, I still carry the trauma of the 2017 World Series, in which the Houston Astros cheated the Dodgers out of a ring, adding insult to injury by doing it at Dodger Stadium in game 7. For these reasons, George Springer (the hero of the Jay’s G7 victory against Seattle in the ALCS) was my–nay every–Dodgers fan’s enemy number 1. Despite Blake Snell, aka Snellzilla’s (lol) dominance against the Phillies and the Brewers, I wasn’t sure how he’d fare against the Blue Jays’ relentless offense. With me and the Dodgers both on the road, I couldn’t hunker down for my usual obsessive-compulsive regime of superstitious rituals. The anxiety led me to drink way more beer than I intended (3 tallboys of Lone Star before first pitch) at the West Alabama Ice House known for their “ice cold” brew. Ricardo Montez, a Rice alum and Texas native brought me there because he thought I might “appreciate a place devoted to cold beer.” Reader, I am NOT a beer drinker. Not even at the stadium for home games. I do, however, appreciate the misrecognition, and I do love a “San Mig Ice” from the subzero coolers they use in Balikbayan bars in Manila. I appreciated it a bit too much that evening, despite drinking with a group of gays who also avoid beer (bc carbs), and who didn’t give a shit about baseball. I was already in poor form, matching Snell’s own, by the time we got to a celebratory dinner for a friend’s new book around the middle innings, as I vainly tried to resume my rituals, which involved drinking mezcal and soda ONLY WHEN the Dodgers were at bat. You can imagine how impossible it was to keep eyes on the game seated at a fancy dinner with eight other people. I only go to the bathroom when the Dodgers are at bat: one of many, painstaking game-watching rituals. Don’t ask me why (you don’t want to know). I’ve been doing it since 2020.That night, I couldn’t wait for a break because of the aforementioned tallboys, so I got up and went to the bathroom while the Jays were up in the bottom of the 6th. It was at that moment of sloppy “game management” on my part (or at least that’s what my twisted brain told me) that the Jays’ Addison Barger hit a grand slam off Anthony Banda, the lady Dodger fans’ favorite presumed “fuckboi,” who came in for Snell in relief. Barger made it 9-2 and essentially put G1 out of reach for the Dodgers. Many of you are probably aware of the idiom, “beer before hard, you’re in the yard,” meaning if you drink beer before hard liquor, you will (as the other saying goes) never be sicker. That night, beer before hard led to the Jays going yard multiple times. At least that’s what my twisted, superstitious psyche told me. Not even the lucky Dodgers tee tucked under my conference-appropriate button-down was going to save us. It was time to reset all the rituals and pass out back at the hotel, much to the chagrin of my friends and my spouse who witnessed my full descent into despair as I instructed the Uber driver to play TSwift’s “Father Figure” at full volume, while I sang along. KT: This was the first game that Adrian and I let ourselves chat beforehand. I interpreted it then as a magnanimous gesture from someone who felt really good because their team was up 1-0 in the series after a dominant performance. Other “casuals” who were watching the WS for the first time were not so kind to me on other social media platforms, with the Dodgers being the so-called ruiners of baseball for our Daddy Warbucks payroll. My public posture after G1 was that I was “too blessed to be stressed,” but the truth was I was languishing in the kind of depressive hungover state I’d experienced before in my younger days of conferencing, especially when my panel was scheduled at 9am local time as it was the morning of G2. I threw my now unlucky clothes and totems into a dirty laundry bag in my suitcase, and surrendered to the conference, knowing full well that I had another group dinner scheduled while G2 was scheduled to air. I was much more cautious and undertook a regime of rest and rehydration to prepare. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was on the mound that night, and he’d just thrown a complete 9 innings in his last start for the NLCS. Derek Jeter emphatically stated on the pregame show that Yoshi wouldn’t be able to do it again. Since everyone knew–and witnessed in G1–how the Dodgers’ bullpen was absolute ASS (and had been for most of the season), Yoshi’s unlikely capacity to “do 9 innings again” spelled more trouble for Los Doyers in Toronto. Yamamoto had a shaky start and I was worried he was on the path to Snellsville; but he managed to get out of a jam in the first with some heads-up defensive plays behind him. I exhaled and took up a new viewing ritual in the process: I reasoned that we’d make it through clean innings if I didn’t watch while we pitched. This was a convenient ritual to take up just as we arrived at a group dinner at the classic Houston Tex-Mex joint, Ninfa’s Original. Football was on all of Ninfa’s TVs, so I was in no danger of an errant glance a la Lot’s wife. Turns out the game was a pitchers’ duel between Yamamoto and Toronto’s Kevin Gausman, so I missed a lot. At one point, Gausman retired 17 Dodgers in a row as the game was knotted at 1, and it was looking bleak as our offense seemed flaccid once again. By the top of the 7th inning, I stopped hiding my phone and rudely propped it up against my modified lucky drink: mezcal and soda with THREE ORANGE SLICES (representing three clean outs for Yoshi), which was to be sipped only during Dodgers at-bats. It was at that moment that our fresh prince, Will Smith, the Dodgers’ catcher who opened the scoring earlier in G2 with an RBI single, homered for the go-head run putting the Dodgers up 2-1. Shortly thereafter, Max Muncy, “that funky Muncy” (sung to the tune of the Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey”) followed up with another solo homer to put the Dodgers up 3-1. The Dodgers went on to score two more in the top of the 8th after an extended Jonas Brothers’ performance of “I Can’t Lose” as part of the Mastercard-sponsored “Stand Up to Cancer” segment featured every year during the World Series. Some Toronto fans complained about how limber the 7th-inning-stretch was, allowing their pitcher to get cold. Of course, I tucked that song away for future use, turning it into an emergency totem. Yamamoto closed out all 9 innings of G2 for a final score of 5-1. Adrian reached out to me that night to call Yoshi’s performance a “master class,” and we traded photos of the “bad Yama Mamma” (sung to the tune of Carl Carlton’s “She’s a Bad Mama Jama…”) striking his own stretch like a “bad bitch,” as Dodgers fans love to say. AdL: Yeah, we got wrecked by Yoshi, or as Karen called him via text, “My Bad Bitch.” It was one thing to know his worth from that fat contract he signed, and it was another thing to witness why mercenaries (including pitchers) are one of the world’s oldest and best paid professions. And don’t get me wrong, I love Kevin Gausman. He earned his keep by shutting down the Dodgers offense early on. But I fear Yoshinobu Yamamoto more. After my brimming (oozing, overflowing, really) confidence after G1, I had to send Karen a text at the end of that game to congratulate her on behalf of her Bad Bitch, and I was certain that she was curled up and happily scrolling like that meme: The real suffering that night, though, was that one of my reliable neighborhood spots, my go-to hookah lounge, which was usually a font of good juju, was completely off. The live stream didn’t work, and I tried logging into my own accounts to find a decent stream, and ended up settling for a free seven-day trial of (yuck) Fox One. The entire time, a British woman kept yapping in my ear, complaining to me about how slow the food was taking five minutes after she ordered, ridiculing me for not being able to set up the stream (while admitting that she’d never worked a Roku her entire life), ranting about how grimy the East Village is, and groaning about how the establishment – a hookah lounge – smells like smoke. Yes, I blame Good King Charles’s loyal subject for this game’s seventh inning. But what’s baseball if not arbitrarily blaming inconveniences and constellational misalignments for your team’s loss? KT: Both the Dodgers and I were back in L.A. for G3 on Monday the 27th. I was feeling good and loose about the next three games, especially after the Dodgers stole one in Toronto, wrenching back the home-field advantage, and turning the series into a potential “best of 5.” I didn’t reach back out to Adrian that day, probably because I was feeling as smug as he did after G1. Plus, I didn’t want to jinx anything by consorting with a rival, especially because I had my whole set-up ready at home: Madre Mezcal Espadin on hand with limes harvested from my backyard, and a giant bottle of Tajin. Snacks were locked and loaded, and I even had a couple of chops defrosting in the fridge to make a wholesome dinner at home after a long day of teaching on campus. I dared to wear the same non-Dodgers clothes I wore for G2 at the Houston conference, and went to campus knowing the game would start just when my spouse and I had to drive home at 5pm. Our house is only 1.4 miles away from Dodger Stadium (I typically walk to games), and we were ensnared in the World Series traffic compounding an already gnarly rush hour down Alvarado into Echo Park. We listened to the first inning and a half on the car radio, and made it home in time to pour a lucky mezcal drink just before former-Blue Jay, Teoscar Hernandez homered to put the Dodgers up by 1 in the bottom of the 2nd. Shohei Ohtani followed with another towering solo shot at the end of the 3rd. Max Scherzer was on the bump for the Jays, and while I harbor less antipathy for him than for Springer, there is no love lost for “dead arm” Scherzer in Los Angeles. He acquired that reputation during his brief stint with the Dodgers in 2021, after he refused to pitch in the NLCS, citing his supposed “dead arm.” Many speculated he was just preserving himself for a monster free agency because his contract was ending. That evening, our foster cats’ “real parents,” Chelsea and Nick Berkofsky began texting us about the game. We ended up with their litter-mate tabbies, Speedy and Amelia, after the Altadena fires consumed their home in early January. The family had to downsize into a studio apartment in Echo Park with their other cat, their dog and their toddler. As bereaved cat parents who lost both of our beautiful littermates Lily and Corky within a calendar year, we offered to help the Berkofskys out with a long-term foster situation for at least two of their brood. The Blue Jays’ catcher, Alejandro Kirk clocked Tyler Glasnow with a three run homer in the top of the 4th, flipping the game upside down as the sports announcers like to say. It was then that Chelsea, a diehard Latina Dodgers fan, and I fully converted our group chat for Speedy and Amelia into a Dodgers anxiety thread. I changed my clothes back into my recently laundered lucky Dodgers shirt (featuring the 2024 World Series championship trophy), and stuck to my neurotic routine of not watching our pitching halves each inning. I also convinced myself that vigorous texting with the cat thread and other friends like Oliver Wang should be added to my many superstitious rituals. It seemed to work, because we’d tied the score again with “ribeye steaks” (i.e. RBIs) from Shohei in the 4th, and Freddie Freeman in the 5th. The Jays pulled ahead 5-4 again in the top of the 7th, and I knew it was time to experiment with an untapped resource: the Jonas Brothers’ “I Can’t Lose.” It worked. Shohei homered for the 2nd time in the bottom of the 7th to tie the game at 5-5. The score stayed stuck that way for another 11 innings. You can see the line of palm trees ringing Dodger stadium’s western slope from our living and dining room windows. With each passing inning and hour, the beleaguered “awwws” echoing from beyond the palms tipped me off around 30 seconds before each play aired that we hadn’t managed to walk it off yet. I also heard the roars of relief when Clayton Kershaw came in from the bullpen and got out of the jam in the top of the 12th. That single, crucial out would constitute his last appearance on the mound in his baseball home. The rest of the game unfolded as a blur of intentional walks to Shohei, a fruit platter delivered to the Blue Jays’ dugout, and guys whose names we never heard of deep in the roster. (L.A. sports teams’ fruit platter game goes HARD, as I learned from being an Angel City Football Club season ticket holder). Adrian and I had to break the tension, risking whatever bad juju might come for either of us as a result of talking to each other DURING a game instead of before or after. Despite the conciliatory tone of his final message, I knew Freddie’s walk-off homer in the bottom of the 18th, with shades of G1 in 2024, must’ve eviscerated Adrian as much as it elated me. It was time to shut up and go to bed. AdL: Already anxiety-struck with the dread of three games in Los Angeles, I came into the game doubly anxious about not being able to finish preparing for class. To ease the pain, I met my boo in downtown Brooklyn to watch the new Chainsaw Man movie, and indeed, animated gore was the perfect prelude (and unfortunate symbology) for the game after. We found a sports bar nearby, and wanting to live up to my reputation as a Devoted Undergraduate Instructor, I resolved to make the bar my office, and accompanied G2 with a side of light-hearted readings on Japanese imperialism across the Pacific. At the top of the ninth, tied at five apiece, I had finished class prep, and hastily wrote out the lesson plan along the margins of the back page, because I had forgotten my notebooks, and for some reason, it felt like bad juju to dig through my bag when, at any moment, the Jays or the Dodgers could win the game by some complete fluke. But the boo had fallen asleep in the bar booth, and I knew it was time to go, because we had to Go To Work the next day, but not before she snapped this live react, somewhere between the top of the tenth and the bottom of the twelfth: In between stretches of subway tunnel, I refreshed my ESPN app frantically, trying to follow along. (Incidentally, we agree that the MLB interface of the app is the best one, far superior to the cluster—- that is the NBA page’s nonsensical statistical spreadsheet.) Up the steps of all five floors of our walkup, I played the live audio off my phone. By the top step, my New York BBL was fully engaged, but my brain was complete mush. The boo suggested (very strongly) that I not stay up too late, because I had to teach both lectures the next day, with meetings and a dissertation prospectus defense in between. Naturally, I did not listen to her, and I lay in bed watching the game on my phone, and occasionally texting Karen, because in the stupor of the sixteenth inning, somewhere between 2 and 2:30am, who else would understand the maniacal delirium than my dear friend across the continent? Alas, when Freddie, my fellow Canadian, murdered his country with a walk-off, I sent that farewell text, and like Stewie from Family Guy, turned over in my blanket, and there was a non-zero chance that I let out a tiny sob. AdL: At this point, my work wardrobe was designed around all my Jays merch. The boo offered to wash my jersey that night, and I almost accepted because it was getting kinda dank, but we reminded ourselves of the preeminent value of ritual, and left it sufficiently grimy. My senior colleague, who was the chair of the dissertation prospectus defense I attended that afternoon, stared his impenetrable stare at my outfit, and I was concerned that he might have been a hostile die-hard Dodgers fan. Then I remembered that he had just come out with a book about suburbanization in his Pennsylvanian hometown. That relief was confirmed after we wrapped up our student’s defense (which was, unsurprisingly, quite stellar), and he asked how I was feeling about the series, and insisted that the Jays were destined to win, because billion-dollar payrolls were bound to crash and burn. “I can’t stand the Dodgers!” he proclaimed, and I gave him a thumbs-up and a forced smile, because like the former theater kid I was, my superstitious ass couldn’t shake the bad vibes from anything other than a break a leg. “Good luck tonight!” My students, fortunately, were also cheering for my home team, but more out of a commitment to anti-Dodgerism (there were, predictably, many Yankees fans who still couldn’t get over how badly we rocked their shit during the ALDS), and less out of support for Toronto. But one of my students, from the potato-rich province of Prince Edward Island, offered generous solidarity as a fellow Canadian passport-holder. I expected that this would tide over the foreboding misfortune that came with the copious well wishes, and I welcomed his cheers wholeheartedly. For some reason, I can’t remember the game, probably because I spent the entire time ranting to the boo about my evening class, which was, admittedly, not my best work. I was trying to teach a brief history of American colonialism in the Philippines, but couldn’t get my head out of how utterly exhausted I was after eighteen innings of head-on-wall-banging baseball. The photo evidence of that day I do have, though, was that, despite all odds, I somehow managed to produce a banger of a whiteboard: Cue the anime guy looking at a butterfly meme: Is this…professor-ing? KT: I can barely remember G4. I was driving home from campus when the game began, feeling hopeful but depleted, knowing Shohei would take the bump after hitting two homers and four extra base hits, and reaching base a grand total of nine times less than 24 hours earlier. I was gobsmacked that Will Smith was catching again after his thighs of steel held it down behind the dish all 18 innings the night before. Adrian and I exchanged pleasantries throughout the day. I sent a laugh/cry emoji to the meme he posted of a fat Blue Jay bird labeled “Alejandro Kirk.” We talked about what positions we played when we were kids (I was a catcher; Adrian played third). The Dodgers opened the scoring early after Mr. Kiktober, Kiké Hernandez hit a sac fly to make it 1-0 in the first. Then Shohei was bested by Vlad in the top of the 3rd: junior dinged a 2-run, 395 foot homer over the left-centerfield wall. Despite some shakiness, Shohei pitched a decent game that kept us competitive at a score of 2-1 heading into the top of the 7th. My liver couldn’t handle the magic mezcal regimen after G2, so I sipped bitters and soda hoping it might still summon some offensive pop from the boys in (Dodger) blue. I cooked another meal using the same spice blend for the chops in G2. All of this was to no avail. The magic was gone. In a fit of desperation I relented to more alcohol, but with less booze-by-volume: Madre “Desert Water” seltzers. I texted furiously with Chelsea, Nick, Oliver and whoever else would listen to me to no avail. I turned on the Joe Bros “I Can’t Lose.” Turns out we can. Another disastrous torrent of Toronto runs against our frail bullpen made it 6-1 entering the final third of the game. We eked out one more run, making the final score 6-2. All my now unlucky clothes were again tossed into the laundry for another hard reboot. I couldn’t even muster up a congratulatory message to Adrian, before trying to “eternal sunshine” the ick that just happened at Dodger Stadium from my mind. Speedy Berkofsky Glowers at Dodger Stadium AdL: I started the day at the dermatologist’s clinic, after an evening of relief over my team’s victory, followed by an anxiety-laden Google search for the symptoms of skin cancer, and a frantic self-inspection, and I grew concerned over a dark spot on my left leg that, by midnight, I was convinced was melanoma. (WebMD really messes you up.) After the doctor’s good news (that mark on my leg was literally just hardened skin that developed from me picking at a mole), I was on the verge of tears, and walked south to Manhattan’s Koreatown to find something good to eat. On 30th Street, I came across a place called Okdongsik, a hole-in-the-wall with room only for bar seats, and their slim menu drew me in. One of the cooks behind the counter motioned me over to the end of the table, first to serve me a bowl of dweji-gomtang (a clear soup with slices of pork atop a pillow of rice porridge), and then to talk shop about the World Series. Fortunately for me, he was sporting a blue and orange Mets hat. He assured me that the Jays would win tonight, because as good as Shohei was, the Dodgers were built for high-variance home runs, and my own team’s terrifying offense – “The Jays play baseball right, and your guys work the count” – was far more sustainable in the long run. Later that evening, the boo and I went on an IKEA run in Red Hook, and I was on a mission to drive her to madness with my incessant name-brand puns (“If the Jays lose the series, what do you think they…LACK?”), and after a quick dinner of Swedish meatballs and gravlax, we took the bus back to downtown Brooklyn to get on the train home. This was a mistake: our bus got stuck behind some asshole van driver who parked his vehicle in the middle of the street – during rush hour – and I was coming down with a bout of motion sickness, exacerbated by the fear that we’d miss a fat chunk of the game. Thankfully, we got home just in time for the middle of the first. We sat down on the couch, and turned on (puke) Fox One, and were treated to a pair of homers, first from Davis “Beautiful Stache” Schneider, and the second from Vladdy Jr. The candles (and other flammable organics) were lit, the barley tea was poured, and we were locked TF in. Stepping up to the mound was my beautiful White American son (no relation), Trey THEE Savage. And as the sports history books will surely write one day, this was to be the apex of his unlikely rise, but no one could have anticipated exactly how historic it’d be: twelve strikeouts with zero walks, the most in a World Series not only by a rookie pitcher, but by any pitcher ever. No one except for me, his proud Filipino dad (no relation), who spent the entire game blessing him with some sage, knew this would happen, so I’d like to think that I had an important role to play: KT: For the first time since the Dodgers returned to L.A, I was home when the game started at 5pm Pacific. I decided to bust out of my routine a little bit, hoping that the slightest rearrangements to the material world might help jumpstart our anemic offense. I re-established my mise-en-place on the kitchen counter: limes from the backyard, Madre Espladin, Tajin. The Los Angeles Athletic Club cocktail tumbler I used to sip my beverages during the Dodgers’ half of each inning was ready for use. I even purchased some new snacks from the Filipino mega-grocery, Island Pacific Market, including garlic-flavored “cornnick” (basically corn nuts with crispy slivers of garlic mixed in), vinegar-and-garlic-flavored chicharron, and a bunch of other stuff chock-full of palm oil that I have no business eating or drinking because of my chronic health conditions. As I was acquiring my bounty at the market, I was struck with the fear that busting out the Pinoy goods might actually backfire and help out Adrian instead of me… It turns out I was right: the game started with Blake Snell tossing two back-to-back meatballs to Schneider and Vladdy to put us down early 0-2. Snellzilla’s mojo from his earlier playoff run was gone. Our stanky (pejorative) bullpen would have to ride again tonight. Meanwhile, it was Trey Yesevage’s night for Toronto. The Jays’ Cinderella story pitched flawlessly, giving up only one home run to (who else), Kiké Hernandez. Otherwise, we whiffed a total of 12 times, and Yesavage set the World Series rookie record for strikeouts. We went down 6-1 with the great Sandy Koufax watching. He was presumably there to see the GOAT, Clayton Kershaw toss his final innings at Dodger Stadium, a scenario that would’ve only been possible if the score line was reversed. Beneath the shadow of another loss, Kersh lingered on the field with his family soaking it all in before the whole team went back to Toronto down 2-3 with their backs against the wall, fighting to live another day. Another team stalwart loitered after everybody was gone in the dugout: Miguel “Miggy” Rojas stared off into an empty stadium looking forlorn. Maybe it was the competitive anguish in his eyes, but I knew then that Miggy–a clubhouse leader beloved by the Dodger faithful, if relatively unknown amongst casual WS watchers–might just be our only hope. KT: Backs against the wall. Do or die. On Halloween no less. I was up early, because I had to bring my wife Sarah in for a routine medical procedure at 6:30am Pacific. All the nurses, docs, anesthesiologists, and other patients were chattering about what might happen in G6 and a potential G7. One doctor even went so far as to say he was considering canceling his birthday dinner reservation at Hippo in Highland Park the following night if game seven came to fruition. A baseball fan’s superstitions, especially when their team is facing elimination, carry the same potency, and demand the same fastidiousness as a religious zealot’s rites. My spouse understood this and was kind enough to let me drag her around town as “the good drugs” wore off to re-stock my ceremonial essentials: Madre Espladin, a particular brand and flavor of potato chip which we ran out of at the end of G3, and a magic item I hadn’t considered to incorporate since Yamamoto’s last victorious start in G2: oranges. Clearly the backyard limes weren’t doing their thing. I also opted for new vestments, and wore my “L.A. Strong” wildlife relief tee. I’m ashamed to admit that most of L.A. had more confidence in Yoshi’s capacity to redeem us than I. Wasn’t he sick of doing all the work for the group project? How fresh could he be after another complete game within less than a week? I prayed to a god I’d long ago alienated that the oranges would work. He and the Jays’ starter Kevin Gausman carried on much as they did during their first head-to-head battle in G2, keeping it scoreless on both sides through three. I observantly replenished my three orange slices each inning and scurried away every time we pitched, keeping track of the game through its ambient sounds from the other room, while refreshing my MLB app nonstop for live updates that were about 30 seconds ahead of the TV feed in the other room. As my therapist and I have discussed, baseball superstitions provide a convenient screen for a person’s obsessive compulsive tendencies. Mine have worsened through each passing postseason, and I can’t help but wonder if the Catholicism I was conditioned to observe with greater reverence hasn’t somehow been reanimated in all the practices I’ve taken up on behalf of Dodger baseball. The boys finally pushed through in the top of the 3rd with RBIs from Will Smith and the sleeping giant, Mookie Betts, who admitted after G5 that he had been “terrible” all series long. With a small lead, Saint Yoshi went back to work, but it wasn’t long before the devil himself, George Springer brought in the Blue Jays’ first run with a single in the bottom of the 3rd. At this point I had to clean out all the oranges accumulating in my L.A. Athletic Club cocktail tumbler, but wondered desperately if I might be cursing us in the process. After getting out of a jam in the 6th, Yoshi left the game for our bullpen to finish, leaving me scant hope for a game seven. I missed the dawgs of last year’s pen, the true MVPs, when we had no starting pitching to speak of other than a less polished Yoshi, and the hot L.A.-born himbeaux, Jack Flaherty, borrowed for a year from the Detroit Tigers. Throughout G6, Miggy Ro’made a couple of spectacular defensive plays at second base, including a barehander to first in the bottom of the 7th to keep the Jays’ rolling offense at bay. Justin “Wrobo” Wrobleski kept things clean from the bullpen and handed it over to Roki Sasaki, the Japanese wunderkind who the Dodgers signed as a rookie starter, but who ended up flourishing in the postseason as a closer. “Bailalo Roki” (as Miggy Ro’ nicknamed him after DJ Roderick’s “Bailalo Rocky”), worked his way out of a jam in the 8th, only to hit Alejandro Kirk by a pitch to send a runner on base in the bottom of the 9th. Kirk was taken out of the game for a swifter pinch runner, Myles Straw. Addison Barger, the same guy who staked Dodger hearts with a pinch hit grand slam in G1 came to the plate and hit a towering fly into center field over Justin Dean’s head. That hit, likely a double or even a triple, would’ve tied the game with no outs, putting Barger in scoring position to win it all for the Jays. As if commanded by the (Dodger) baseball gods, the ball simply dropped dead into the padding of the Rogers Centre outfield. Dean flung his hands up into the air to signal the umps for a dead ball. The home field advantage that was supposed to bring the Blue Jays their first title in thirty-two years pulled some Freaky Friday, Halloween, “Fall of the House of Usher” type shit with the Rogers Centre’s padding. The wedged ball was an automatic ground-rule double, freezing the runners at 2nd and 3rd with no outs, and keeping the score locked at 3-1 Dodgers. Tyler Glasnow, the presumptive starter for a possible G7, came in for young Roki, as all of Los Angeles collectively girded its loins. The next Jays batter, the red hot Ernie Clement, hit an infield pop up on Glasnow’s first pitch securing at least one measly out. Andres Gimenez took his place in the batters box with the Dodgers’ most loathed, George Springer looming on deck. Gimenez flared what looked to be a bloop single towards shallow left field when Mr. Enrique Hernandez, our October trickster, came charging in from nowhere to make the grab, following-through with a swift, targeted throw to Miguel Rojas for a game-ending double play. I saw none of this and only heard it, of course, since I was hunched over anxiously in the other room observing the sequestration demanded by this year’s liturgy for the World Series. In so doing, we were granted another day. Amen to that. AdL: Drake just had to ruin everything, didn’t he? After my beautiful White American Son (no relation) struck Shohei out in G5, Toronto’s National Disgrace decided to troll the greatest baseball player of all time (and I say that with zero irony) with a couple of dumbass Instagram stories. And this, my friends, is when I first had an inkling that we might lose the World Series: Instead of dwelling on the disastrous double play (and the doubly emphatic primal screams) at the end of the game, and instead of talking about the fact that I spent a good chunk of the game explaining the intricacies of the Jays’ and the Dodgers’ shades of blue to an Australian acquaintance, allow me to talk shit about Drake. I’m the kind of kid from Toronto that has an encyclopedic knowledge of the first half of Drake’s discography, but not the second half, when he decided he’d levitate away from the city’s potholed streets and perch himself atop the former tallest freestanding structure in the world. This included his unreleased tracks on YouTube, those urban anthems with the gritty circulatory undercurrent of a mixtape, as well as the features that he scattered to the winds (his early collabs with now-enemies Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross were notable masterpieces). To put it in local geography: everything before and up to the album on the left (If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late) is music you can listen to while napping on the late night bus to Scarborough after a line-cook shift downtown, or bump windows-down from a late night drive in your 1997 Honda Civic after a break-up with your situationship. Everything from and after the album on the right (Views), after the first three tracks, is down right unlistenable for anyone not a regular at a bottle-service-only club on King Street West (for my Angelenos, this is a street with the manicured aesthetics of the Arts District but the diversity and energy of the Venice Erewhon). This drop-off was unfortunate, because while Drake’s stocks plateaued (as he shifted towards maximizing Spotify streams instead of crafting albums), Toronto sports skyrocketed to their eminent place today. The spring after Drake released If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, the Raptors repeated as Atlantic Conference champions for the first time in team history, and later that fall, the Blue Jays flipped bats and took names all the way to the ALCS. It was with some personal trepidation, then, that when the Raptors were to face (and beat) the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals in 2019, I had to watch Drake take credit (in the Royal We) for momentum that was far greater than he. For a solid year after Mr. Kendrick Lamar vivisected his middle-class Canadian counterpart, I was questioned about my feelings on the Kendrick-Drake “beef” (which was really a slaughter). Toronto’s beloved sports alumni, Angelenos first (like Demar DeRozan, more loved than Drake would ever be in the city) snubbed the metropolis’s most eminent washed rapper. When Drake laid low for a while, and started teasing snippets from his yet-to-be-released album over the summer, the chatter seemed to die down. But by October, when it became clear that the Jays were to go head to head with the Dodgers, I thought: here we go again! All I wanted was for the guy to keep his cursed social media thumbs off the Jays. By G6, it was clear that Aubrey had lost his touch. One might blame it on Kendrick’s clinical dissection of an October Scorpio (I’m a November Scorpio, we don’t claim him), but at the end of the day, like the Rogers Centre’s walls that wedged the ball into themselves, it was Mr. Graham who was his own worst enemy, and the thorn in Toronto’s foot. KT: As I mentioned earlier, part of me (all of me?) never got over G7 in 2017 against the Astros. One of the things I did wrong that day–as if it had anything to do with me–was schedule a huge campus event on the TV show UnReal. That event ended with the saddest stream of texts, and a drive back to Echo Park through an abject eerie silence, when I’d hoped to be dodging fireworks and crowds streaming onto Alvarado Blvd from all corners. Cut to 2025, and my calendar was clear except for a BBQ earlier in the day at my friend and colleague Natalia Molina’s place in South Pasadena. Natalia grew up in Echo Park (her family still lives here), and their Dodgers fandom is beautifully chronicled in several pieces Natalia has written, including one on this year’s series amidst the ICE raids and bifurcated feelings of its fans: a love for the team and the city vs. our vitriol for its primary owner, Mark Walter, who has investments in ICE detention centers. Most of us were wearing Dodgers gear as we supped on the tri-tip Ian, Natlia’s husband, made special for the day. I was made painfully aware of the fact that my wildfire relief “L.A. Strong” tee signified differently in that neighborhood, where so many homes were lost or damaged in January. Los Angeles had been besieged by both fire and ICE in 2025. Would we make it to the other side of all that to experience the balm of a much-needed win? Even though I packed a little tote to bring to Natalia’s in case I wanted to stay and watch the game (with a tub of sliced oranges, Madre Espladin, the lucky potato chips, and a complete outfit change into a Japanese Dodgers tee and Aussie pajama pants that acquired some magic late into G6), I decided I needed to be in the comfort of my own home for whatever chaos might come. I also wasn’t sure I wanted to expose a beloved colleague to the true bonkersness of my game-watching routines. We dashed home and got settled in time to watch “dead arm” Scherzer give up a hit to Shohei which yielded nothing. My G7 traumas were reactivated when Springer clocked a solid single off Shohei, who was starting again on very short rest (just 3 days). Sho somehow got out of the inning not only by striking-out Vlad with a 100 mph fastball across the plate (Vlad clocked a pitch like that for his 2-run homer against Shohei in G3), but by virtue of Will Smith’s head’s up double-play, that took advantage of Springer’s deliciously bad base-running error. Shohei looked sweaty and spent, but he managed mightily through the first two innings without giving up any runs. I was convinced this was contingent on the miracle of Yoshi’s oranges, which I kept in my own G7 lineup. By the bottom of the 3rd, however, he surrendered a three run no-doubter to Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays’ wounded hero (I miss his Jesus hair and beard), whose contract is up at the end of the year. At that point I was still sequestered in the other room, listening to the ambient sounds of Rogers Centre crescendoing with the taste of victory on the tip of their tongues. My body slumped backwards into a “Death of Chatterton” pose. I was studiously avoiding any communication with Adrian or peeping on social media. Instead, I texted anxiously with the Berkfoskys, Rhys Ernst, Oliver Wang and others. I decided a kind of ascetic, sectarian approach to stimulation from the outside world was the only way to approach this most volatile of scenarios. Baseball is a long game, as G3 and this epic tome we’ve written, remind us. By the top of the 4th, the Dodgers managed to take one back. By the bottom of the 4th, the benches and Dodgers’ bullpen cleared as “Wrobo” dinged Gimenez who (I still insist) dangled his hand in the zone on purpose in the previous sequence. After the dust settled with two on and two out in the bottom of the 4th, the Dodgers activated their starting rotation from the bullpen and sent Glasnow in to continue the game, despite having pitched in relief the night before. There was action on the bases every inning. Dead arm Scherer was pulled in the top of the 5th, and by the top of the 6th the Dodgers narrowed it to a 1-run game on a Tommy Edman sac fly. By the bottom of the 6th, the Jays stretched the lead back up to 4-2. Covered in chip crumbs, and reeking of Madre Espladin muddled with freshly squeezed oranges, I realized I hadn’t eaten any dinner. It didn’t matter. I persevered and continued my rituals. At one point I considered busting out the wood rosary I bought at Quiapo cathedral in Manila in 2016. I finally peeked at social media, and I noticed Adrian was also silent. I wondered where he was watching and how he might be doing. I envied the position he and his team were in, with a two run lead and only a handful of outs left to go. For some reason I toggled over into a strange sense of calm. Is this what they mean by “letting go?” Is this the sensation of one’s soul leaving one’s body? Or was it simply my mezcal-ravaged, nutrition-deprived frame, lapsing into a state of homeostatic survival? We reached the top of the 8th with Trey Yesavage in relief for the Jays. The thing I love about game sevens is that teams are forced to empty out their dugouts and bullpens. There’s no hoarding the talent, and the fans are treated to ace starters in relief, and the utility heroes known only to their respective hives coming in to fulfill their specialty roles. Joe Davis and John Smoltz wondered aloud about Yesavage still working when the real Mad Max, aka that Funky Muncy, clobbered a solo home run to bring us within one. I YAWWWWWWPED and sent the foster kitties scurrying into safe spaces under beds and sofas. At this juncture, Sarah was on her way home from a friend’s art opening with a couple of other pals in tow. “Do you need anything?” she asked via text. “We need more oranges,” I replied, forgetting about real food because I was newly feasting on hope. Emmet Sheehan and Blake Snell came through by holding it down on the mound in the bottom half of the 8th, then in the flash of an instant we were down to only two at-bats left in our season at the top of the 9th. Miggy Ro’ was batting in the 9-spot with one out and nobody on. Miggy worked the count to 3-2 against Hoffman. Hoffman threw a hanging slider, and Mr. Miguel Elias Rojas Naidenoff (where did that last name come from anyway?) sent it over the left field wall into the glove of a Jays fan holding a Canadian flag. The most cursed of souvenirs, courtesy of Los Angeles. The game was tied at 4-4. I hate to be THAT guy, but I always knew it would be Miggy Ro’. This was the same Miggy Ro’ who held onto Kiké’s throw at the end of G6 to turn the double play that sent us to G7. This was the same guy whose defensive prowess got us out of multiple jams through G7; the same guy who lingered in the dugout after we pooed the scrooch in G5, contemplating if his career with the Dodgers wouldn’t end with a giant, ignominious “L.” Miguel Rojas is also a Venezuelan player whose family members weren’t granted visas to watch him play, because of the United States’ fucked up immigration policies and travel restrictions. In other words, the man had STAKES, and he did what so many hard-working unsung immigrants do and lifted us off the mat to give us a fighting chance with his most unlikely and unbelievable blast of destiny. With our holy trinity of Shohei, Freddie and Mookie failing to tack on insurance runs, we headed to the bottom of the 9th with Blake Snell still on the mound. Dave Roberts made another key substitution in the home half of the 9th: Our Cuban outfielder, Andy Pages was sent into center field for his rocket arm. Pages also shares Miggy’s predicament insofar as no one from his family other than his wife has been granted a visa to see him play in a Dodgers uniform. The bottom of the 9th felt dangerous AF with the heart of the Blue Jays line-up due: Vladdy, Bo Bichette, and grand slam Addison Barger (the name of Adrian’s future spawn). Vladdy popped out, and Bichette knocked a single to left. With Barger working a walk to put runners on first and second, Snell was pulled from the game. Yoshinobu Yamamoto emerged from the dugout a mere 24 hours or so after he saved our skins with a 96 pitch, 6-inning performance. Yoshi hit Kirk with a pitch to load the bases with only one out. Varsho flared a ball to Miggy Ro’ (of course) who threw a laser to Will Smith at home despite falling backwards. Kiner-Falefa, who represented the World Series winning run, was forced out at home. The call withstood a review showing Will Smith’s foot barely tapping the plate before IKF’s foot crossed the threshold. I was having an out of body experience, and I decided to throw all caution to the wind. I abandoned my sequestration and began to watch in earnest as Sarah returned home with some shrimp fried rice, and our friends Fonz and Sabsi. Yoshi and the Dodgers were not out of the woods yet with two outs and the bases loaded. The Blue Jays’ winning run remained a mere 90 feet away when Ernie Clement came up to bat and hit a soaring fly ball over Kiké’s head. Oh shit. That was it… Then Andy Pages barreled over from out of nowhere. He knocked Kiké out cold and made an unbelievable grab to send game seven to extra innings. It looked like we’d be riding Yoshi’s back the whole way: whether it was into the abyss, or off into the sunset remained to be seen. Miracles kept accruing in extras, not at the hands of our MVP $uper$tars, but through the pluck and hustle of our immigrant utility players like Rojas and Pages. Wobbly and surfeit of shrimp fried rice after 10-innings of lucky mezcal sips, I lit some incensio de Santa Fe I restocked from Stories Bookstore in Echo Park–another ritual I haven’t even bothered to mention–right before Will Smith came up to bat in the top of the 11th against Shane Bieber. With the count at 2-0, Smith (who I’ve affectionately called a “zygote” for his baby-faced, nay, fetal features), went YARD on a two-seam slider from the Biebs. Cue Justin’s “Sorry.” We heard Echo Park roar through our windows. A few fireworks prematurely popped off. We still had to get through the bottom half of the 11th. Vlad, first up, doubled off Yoshi and was sac-bunted over to third, bringing the tying run 90 feet away with only one out. Yoshi walked Barger, leaving runs on the corners with only 1 out. Then Alejandro Kirk came up to bat: the same thiccc Blue Jay Adrian and I spoke sweetly of earlier in the series. I found it hard not to root for him, even as I wanted–needed–our team to cross the threshold into dynastic glory so that Yankees and Giants fans would finally STFU about winning three in a single decade (still not gonna happen, but…) Yoshi’s splitter broke Kirk’s bat. The thiccc Jay grounded into a game and series ending double-play fielded by Mookie Betts. I’m pretty sure my soul fled my body long before that, only called back into this mortal coil when massive fireworks erupted next door and across the city, as car horns announced our back-to-back victory. According to my friends, I made humping gestures at the TV (a la Kiké’s 2024 celebration) and spewed a tirade of joyous profanities into the phone when my World Series text circle FaceTimed to celebrate. Deliriously HYPED w/ my friend Fonz at the end of G7. My hair is long and crazy because I refused to cut it until the end of the series, a la Kiké, Sho and others. Adrian and I didn’t talk until the next day, when I posted a fish-in-a-barrell meme about how Drake’s presence cost the Jays the World Series. I presented my theory about why the Blue Jays couldn’t close it out ,even after coming home with a 3-2 lead. Ironically, the fact that they came from behind to win the ALCS when they were down 3-2 to the Mariners saddled them with a memento mori. They learned teams could come back from the brink of death. Having done it themselves left that kernel of doubt in their minds, that little fracture in their own faith, when faced with the task of closing it out. I’m certain the Blue Jays will be back in the thick of things at the end of next season. I know it’s been said, and most people don’t mean it, but it truly was a heartbreak for anyone to lose this series which unfurled, as the kids say, as CINEMA. Before I, too, ride off into the sunset singing that Yoshinobu Yamamoto “ace anthem,” it bears acknowledgement that this wild up-and-down season was owed to some very bad karma the Dodgers invited by visiting Trump’s White House (against many of the players’ will), and responding terribly to ICE’s siege of Los Angeles before trying to make up for it with an ambiguous million dollar donation to “support immigrant families.” The excessive trust Doc Roberts placed in our raging MAGA reliever, Blake Treinen (who wrote Charlie Kirk’s name on his hat, and who many Twitter/Bluesky Dodgers fans call “BlaQe” for his Q-Anonish proclivities), made the prospect of our repeat victory in 2025 less palatable for everyone but us diehards. Last year, we had several storylines propelling our victory against the Yankees, who may be the only team more loathed than us at this point. In 2024, our wounded warrior Freddie Freeman, whose kid nearly died, sacrificed his ravaged body for our redemption. This year we were the “American” team playing against all of Canada. The fascist USA didn’t deserve a win, even if the brown people of L.A. could surely use one. As it turns out, a dogfluencer named Air Corgi predicted we would win it in 7, and we did. As I said in a sweet exchange of messages with Canadian Jeopardy superchamp, Mattea Roach the morning of November 1: “I’d be sad if my team lost the World Series, but I wouldn’t be mad if the Blue Jays won.” Part of me can’t fathom going through all of this again next year, though I liken our willful forgetting of baseball’s exquisite anguish to what people say about childbirth. Pressure is a privilege, in the immortal words of Billie Jean King, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Let’s run it back. Illustration by Yunemo Six (@yunemosix) on Bluesky, inspired by the press pool photo I think of as “Yoshi’s Rebirth” AdL: The first of November began with the following New Yorker interaction: a young cashier and I bickered at the GMC while I was picking up Vitamin B12 and D, and when I dared speculate that the Jays might have a real shot at this (which, let’s be real, they were all around the better team). He bellowed, “BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF SHOHEI OHTANI?” Yes, kid, I hm and judging from his hat, I realized that he was a salty Yankees fan, still incredulous we’d beaten his team. But he did teach me a valuable lesson. The key to loving a baseball team is to drown oneself in delusions of the future. The Yankee variant of this delulu, though, comes down to some good ol’ Appeal To History, my logical fallacy of choice, and that their team would always have a chance at winning because, well, they have the most World Series wins out of any team in history. To spiritually realign myself before G7, I walked north to a bakery that has, begrudgingly, earned my respect. The day, blustery and sunny in equal measure, seemed to demand the soothing balm of a fifteen-dollar fried chicken sandwich from a Frenchman who decided, in defiance of his stern Taiwanese mother-in-law, to specialize in Asian baked goods. They had just launched their cold-weather replacement for their tomato sando, and I include this work of simple genius below, partly to make you jealous and hungry, my kind reader, but also to index what was probably the best part of an otherwise extremely sad day. I’m not gonna rehash my own play-by-play of G7 because, quite frankly, it still sucks to think about. The boo and I were to head to Park Slope to attend a friend’s birthday, vampire themed (broadly construed, but always already queer), and not realizing that the party had monopolized the patio all the way at the back of the bar, we opted to sit at a booth and stream the game on my phone from the (puke) Fox One app. We kept the stream going even when we discovered that the shindig had been going on for a solid hour, and the celebrant was handing out ‘zines and admiring the Sinners-themed vampire costumes, and we kept the stream going in the short two-minute walk across the street to the sports bar, where we would gather with about a hundred fans to watch the seventh game of one of the greatest World Series in history. Up until the end of Trey Yesavage’s inning, I was an absolute riot. But as the Dodgers crawled back up, I set my phone on Do Not Disturb, and I retreated to the corner with unyielding focus on the screen. And when Yoshi walked up to the mound, my fellow Jays faithful (and many allies) noticed my silence and my praying hands, whispering to some god that I stopped believing in when I was eighteen. Not to get too emo, but I saw in Jeff Hoffmann’s face a look of self-disappointment that I knew too well, and when the Dodgers finally won, I tried not to walk up to the Latino man screaming FUCK CANADA all over the silent bar. Even as we caught the Uber home, which we rode silently back into Manhattan, I still wondered if I should have punched the dude in the face with the force of the 49th parallel. This is the closest I’ve ever felt to anything one might call patriotism. Allegedly, as I was informed the next day, we missed a make-out conga line at the party, but neither of us were in the mood to contract mono regardless of whether or not we were celebrating or grieving. And grieve I did. I was inconsolable that night and all the next day, a modicum of the sorrow of my fellow Torontonians must have felt at home, a mere sliver of a sliver of what must have been running through Vladdy’s mind, as he sat in the bullpen after the game alone. I opened my inbox and noticed that my student from Prince Edward Island wrote to me in support during the game, and on Sunday, I wrote him back: At the time of writing, Shane “The Other” Bieber just exercised his player option. I anticipate that other pieces will fall into place, and that the Jays are going to run it back. I hope that, truly, this is their 2014 San Antonio Spurs moment, and they come back with a surgical vengeance and topple the Heatles Dodgers because, as that GNC cashier taught me, these delusions are the ingredients to the most World Series pennants in history. We’ll catch up one day, Yankees, if the planet doesn’t burn first. My dear Echo Park comrade reminds me that a baseball victory is completely arbitrary, and that is the game’s thrill and tragedy. Decades of growing up with losing sports teams were cured by that 2019 Raptors championship, but in that case, it took the efforts of a disgruntled mercenary who ended up moving to the lesser Los Angeles NBA team (for an allegedly illicit deal) after that championship. I wanted this World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for my city, or what always remains of it, in spite of the influx of monied conservative transplants and the violent xenophobia, in spite of a grifting premier more interested in funneling public funds to his cronies instead of making lives more livable. I wanted the World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for Vladdy, especially his childhood self kicked-out of the diamond by a racist Yankees staffer, and for Yesavage, who hotel-hopped for the opportunity of his lifetime, and for the hilarious possibility of an Addison De Leon, any and all genders, any and all species. And most of all, I wanted this World Series for myself, so that my parents and I could have witnessed a Jays victory together before their bodies gave out. (Incidentally, as someone who rocks with the Dodgers when it’s not in the context of going up against the Jays, I can’t really share the same feelings for Springer, I’m sorry to say.) Baseball, as the literary scholar and former MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti once wrote, breaks your heart; it is designed to break your heart. And if you – the multiple yous, from my friend Karen to our editor Sarah and to our future readers – may permit me a moment, please allow me to riff on the late professor’s words here: The Jays’ season began in spring, at the blossom of Vladdy Jr.’s new 14-year contract, filling the airwaves with our Dominican Canadian’s joy, and then as soon as the frigid Toronto torrents came, they stopped and left me to face the hardest autumn of my life alone. I counted on my team, relied on them to buffer the pain of my ailing parent, to keep the memory of train-hopping hooky and living-room cheers alive, and then, just when the days and elderly lives were at their twilight, when I needed them the most, they lost. Karen Tongson‘s gender is Totino’s Party Pizza. Adrian De Leon is a writer and a shit disturber, which is Canadian for “double Scorpio.” Lead image: Via WikiMedia 2025 World Series Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers New Era 59Fifty caps NEW ERA SHIBUYA 2025年11月10日の渋谷 202511101805 IMG 2150.jpg Related Posts About Avidly Submissions Avidly Reads Short Book Series Los Angeles Review of Books

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.

Title: More than half of low and middle-income Americans now own stocks. Here's why.

The stock market isn’t just for rich people anymore. More than half of low- and middle-income Americans now invest in capital markets, according to new research by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, a financial nonprofit. And a majority of those less-affluent investors, with household incomes ranging from $30,000 to $80,000, started investing in the past 5 years. In prior generations, owning stocks often meant you had a broker and a lot of money. Even today, the top 1% of wealthy Americans owns half of all stock, federal data shows. But technological leaps and industry shifts have dramatically lowered the bar for entering the market. Nowadays, just about anyone can buy in. “The entry barriers are lower,” said Timothy Flacke, CEO of Commonwealth. “You can start with 50 dollars or, in many cases, a dollar, and a smartphone. That matters.” Stock tips used to circulate in highbrow finance magazines and subscription newsletters as well as country-club golf courses. Today, anyone with internet access can summon an avalanche of investment advice with a simple Google search. YouTube and TikTok brim with investment influencers. And buying stock has never been easier. Online platforms allow consumers to purchase shares without the aid of brokers or the burden of fees. For the price of a coffee, you can own a piece of the market. “These days, no brokerages charge commissions, and many of them allow for fractional shares,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser and financial planning expert at The Motley Fool. “You can invest as little as 5 dollars, in some cases, and get a portion of a share of Nvidia or Microsoft.” The report from BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, published Oct. 13, draws from a nationally representative survey of more than 2,750 Americans, all from households with low or moderate incomes. It’s part of a larger initiative to study the flood of new investors into the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, individual investors opened 46 million new brokerage accounts. The pandemic inspired many Americans to try their hand at investing: They were stuck in their homes, spending less and amassing savings, partly thanks to the federal stimulus effort. “There were some folks who found themselves either with more cash or with more time,” Flacke said. For middle-class Americans, stocks and real estate have served as gateways to the American Dream, rewarding a modest investment with a lifetime of capital gains. In recent years, however, spiraling home prices and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. The stock market, with no minimum investment, remains a viable alternative for building wealth. “A lot of younger people and a lot of lower-income people have not been able to buy their way into the housing market,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. “But they have been able to build their net worth by investing in the stock market, and by owning individual stocks.” As a tool for building wealth, the stock market has done an admirable job of advertising itself. The S&P 500 rose by 261% over the past decade, climbing at an annual rate of 13.6%, according to The Motley Fool. “With a few exceptions, the market has been on an extraordinary tear over the last 10-15 years,” Brokamp said. “That just attracts more attention, and more people invest.” In time, rising stock ownership among lower-income Americans could chip away at historic wealth disparities. In the first quarter of 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans by net worth owned just 1% of all stocks, according to a Motley Fool analysis. With many more lower- and middle-income consumers owning stocks, perhaps their portfolios will eventually grow. “Americans are very good at being consumers,” Silver said. “But they’re also becoming better at being owners, owners of the companies that they’re spending money on.” Lower-income investors have much the same aspirations as higher-income Americans, according to the BlackRock report. Survey respondents cited these as their top investment goals: The survey does not include 401(k) accounts, IRAs and other tax-favored investments. It focuses on consumers investing through standard brokerage accounts. The survey found that newer investors are more likely to own individual stocks, rather than mutual funds or ETFs. That could be a problem. All stocks are volatile, and individual stocks are generally more mercurial than mutual funds and ETFs, which often mirror the performance of a stock or bond index. “My personal preference is for people to start with index funds and then move into individual stocks,” Brokamp said. “But it looks like the opposite is happening now.” The survey suggests new investors “are really hungry for information about how to diversify” their investments, said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “One of the things the industry can do is meet people where they are.” The financial services industry could help new investors, for example, by encouraging more households to open emergency savings accounts, Chamberlain said. A recent analysis by Investopedia found that the average American family should have at least $35,000 in emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses. Emergency savings deliver financial security. Without savings, a lower-income family is more apt to cash out an investment account if a car breaks down or the roof leaks. “One of the things that this survey revealed is the importance of having emergency savings,” Chamberlain said, “to support the investor’s ability to stay the course.”

Title: Bitcoin mining news: Bitcoin mining stocks Lose $8B, Bitdeer’s datacenter fire, AI delays hit CORZ

It was a rough week across Bitcoin mining and broader tech markets. Bitcoin mining stocks sold off alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other large-cap names, and hashprice flirted with cycle lows as bitcoin mining difficulty is still sky high. Against that backdrop, companies faced fires, hardware delays, product launches, and a fresh debate over custodial risk in Bitcoin lending. You are reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube Mining stocks fell sharply this week as part of a wider tech correction. “Everything is just getting absolutely destroyed right now,” Blockspace Founder Will Foxley said on the most recent Mining Pod, pointing out that bitcoin mining stocks have lost $20 billion in their collective market cap since October. (And they lost $8 billion this past Thursday alone). Hashprice is now hovering just above its all time low, which co-host Colin Harper described as “a clear floor for where the average miner is right now in terms of their operating cost.” Hashprice–a measurement of Bitcoin mining revenue–recently tested around $40 per petahash per day, near its all time low, while network difficulty continues to trend higher, according to Luxor’s Hashrate Index. That combination leaves many pure play miners exposed and increases pressure to secure AI or high performance compute tenants to backfill power contracts. At the same time, the podcast hosts warn that phasing out Bitcoin mining too quickly to chase AI could shock revenue and disappoint equity investors. “If you phase it out too quickly, then you just lose a chunk of revenue,” Harper said, arguing that miners need a careful ramp if they want to keep balance sheets and shareholders intact. Bitdeer’s under construction Ohio site suffered an electrical fire that damaged two of 26 planned buildings after welding sparks ignited equipment inside one of the large metal structures. CEO Jihan Wu said on social media that crews were welding on site when sparks flew into the building and caused the blaze, a costly mistake even if insurance covers much of the loss. The fire hit just as Bitdeer reported weak Q3 earnings, missing expectations on revenue and income, and as Wu skipped the earnings call while traveling to an event in Miami. The company also announced a $400 million convertible note, structured with call spreads to limit dilution but still expected to dilute shareholders by 2 to 4 percent. “Down 45 percent over the last five days, just an absolutely brutal drawdown,” Harper said, adding that Tether dropped some 7.7 million shares of Bitdeer from September to October. Bitcoin backed lending app Lava is under fire after a mandatory September update quietly changed how user funds are held. Lava originally launched as a discrete log contract (DLC)-powered lending platform where users locked Bitcoin into a DLC-based multisig, a model that drew users who wanted self custody and programmatic enforcement of loans. The recent app update prompted users to sign a transaction that moved their BTC from the DLC wallet on their phone to institutional cold storage that on chain sleuthing suggests is with Kraken, although Lava has not confirmed the custodian. Harper said users were told they were moving to a “new vault” but not that this vault used a completely different custodial model, calling it “a really bad look” for a sector already scarred by the fallout of last cycle’s leading crypto loan companies, BlockFi and Celsius. “You seem to have needed to move to a custodial cold storage model to lock lower interest rate credit,” Harper said, “but the way in which you went about it completely obliterated trust.” Auradine, one of the few U.S.-based Bitcoin mining hardware makers, announced its next generation TeraFlux miner. The rig can hit 9.8 joules per terahash in eco mode, in line with current generation machines from Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan according to the hosts. At standard settings it delivers around 310 terahash per second, or 240 terahash per second in eco mode, with efficiency closer to 11 joules per terahash when pushed for more hashrate. Auradine plans air cooled, hydro, and immersion variants, matching the current expectation that vendors ship multiple thermal configurations at launch. “I like to see the unit competitive against other manufacturers,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said, adding that broader support for non-Chinese manufacturers would help diversify supply. Private miner NYDIG and its parent Stoneridge continue to scale a vertically integrated mining strategy centered on oil and gas assets. This week, AFE Founder Brandon Davis shared his findings that Stone Ridge is lining up a $2.3 billion dollar acquisition of Eagle Ford, an oil and gas basis in South Texas. The Mining Pod hosts noted that this follows Stone Ridge’s planned purchase of Conoco Phillips assets in Oklahoma, and NYDIG’s pending buy out of Crusoe’s flared gas mining operations. With these moves, Stone Ridge appears to be building a portfolio that combines upstream energy, midstream services, and mining infrastructure under one umbrella. “What Bitcoin mining will survive in the U.S. will be at the energy level,” Harper said, arguing that Stoneridge’s growing oil and gas portfolio gives it a structural edge as other miners scale back. The show closed with a segment on Core Scientific and its key AI client CoreWeave. In a tense CNBC interview, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator framed delays at certain Core Scientific data centers in Texas and Oklahoma as a temporary construction issue and stressed that customer contracts and revenue are only pushed back by about one quarter. Markets were not convinced: CoreWeave shares are down about 50% from recent highs amid concerns that many “neocloud” providers will miss aggressive build timelines.

Title: BlackRock Launches Expansion Of $2.5 Billion BUIDL Fund Into Binance And BNB Chain

Securitize and Binance have jointly announced on Friday that the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) will now be accepted as off-exchange collateral for trading on Binance. Fortune reported that the collaboration with Binance is expected to boost the popularity of BUIDL, a token launched by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, last year. Since its inception, BUIDL has witnessed significant growth, with its market capitalization exceeding $2.5 billion. Functioning akin to a stablecoin, BUIDL is commonly utilized as collateral for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, catering primarily to large institutional investors like private equity firms and hedge funds that make a minimum investment of $5 million into the BlackRock BUIDL fund. What sets BUIDL apart from traditional stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) is its unique feature of distributing the yield collected from its reserves to investors. Currently offering a yield of around 4%, BlackRock imposes a management fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% on the token. To bring BUIDL into existence, BlackRock collaborates with Securitize, a company specializing in issuing digital assets. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, highlighted the growing popularity of tokenized assets due to their ability to facilitate quick and efficient trade settlements. Domingo emphasized the “antiquated nature” of current capital market ledgers, often built on outdated software, contrasting this with the “agile and near-instant settlement capabilities” of blockchain technology. Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP & Institutional, noted that the addition of BUIDL was driven partly by customer demand. She noted in the statement: Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements. Concurrently, BUIDL is set to introduce a new share class on the BNB Chain network, enhancing investor reach and interoperability with other blockchain financial applications. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL marked BlackRock’s inaugural tokenized fund on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and seamless peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds upon BUIDL’s presence across networks like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), and Solana (SOL), further enhancing its accessibility and utility within the blockchain ecosystem. When writing, Binance’s native token, BNB, trades at $931.60, recording losses exceeding 20% in the past 30 days. This positions Binance Coin 32% below all-time high levels of $1,369 reached back in October of this year.

Title: After Lions tour and last Autumn Nations, Wallabies ‘now well versed with Ireland players’

It’s 7.50am on Friday. The high-pitched whine is an audible reminder of the wind that buffets the doors of the Radisson hotel in Stillorgan, Co Dublin; the slanting rain being the second element in a two-pronged assault. A seagull seeks shelter under an awning. Joe Schmidt bids farewell to a friend in the lobby, stopping briefly for a chat. Australia will soon make the short hop to Blackrock for their Captain’s Run. Upstairs, Wallabies skipper Harry Wilson holds court, an engaging interviewee. There are no Australian journalists present, instead a couple take to the online portal. It’ll be a slow day in every respect, once the on-pitch run-though is over. Coffee and Netflix get a mention, the staples for a team confined to base. Both Wilson and Schmidt mentioned last year’s clash between the countries, a game the Wallabies led until the final eight minutes, when Ireland pilfered a 22-19 win. Andy Farrell’s side have eight survivors in the run-on team, Australia, nine, so there are enough points of difference not to get bogged down by historical reference. Wilson pointed out that between last November’s meeting and the Lions series the Wallabies have become well versed with the Ireland players. Wilson was asked about one of them, Jack Conan. “He’s a really good ball carrier, a strong ball carrier, which you definitely felt during that Lions series. He’s quite good in the lineout too, got a good jump on him, so I think he’ll definitely help their lineout,” he said. “When you have a player like Caelan Doris move to seven, they’re going to have a lot of good ball carriers in their backrow. That’s a really big point for us where our backrow is going to have to step up and try and stop them there because they’ve obviously picked quite a big one. But I think it’s always exciting when you get to go up against three quality backrows.” Three kilometres down the road at the Aviva Stadium it was a case of “right back at you” as Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, was asked about the Aussie loose trio and in particular the indefatigable Fraser McReight. “Set piece is a big focus area,” Doris said. “Scrum and lineout, how we show up there. Breakdown-wise, I’m obviously playing seven [and] up against McReight, who’s been world-class over the last couple of years. I think he was top poacher in the Rugby Championship and contests a ton of balls. So, breakdown is going to be a big point. “He’s [McReight] extremely fit. His work-rate is almost unparalleled. We saw a clip of him, I think it was the 76th minute of a game a few weeks back. He makes a tackle, gets off the ground, chases, gets on the end of a ball and scores a try. His stats each game are very high. “He has got a good skill set as well, he’s a good footballer and has the ability to play the ball off the line. He’s not the biggest guy, but he carries pretty strongly as well. The standout thing is his work rate.” Doris is unfazed by swapping his traditional role at eight for a crack at openside flanker. He will continue to try to cause chaos at the breakdown. “The first breakdown battle off scrums and lineouts is going to be a difference. Up against McReight, it’s going to be one that I’m looking forward to and need to get right,” he said. There is a sense that both Ireland and Australia are trying to wriggle out from underneath a blanket of criticism in some quarters that decries a level of recent underperformance. The Wallabies are suffering legacy disappointment from Udine and the 26-19 defeat to Italy; Ireland from the 13-26 defeat to the All Blacks in Chicago and a failure to blossom in the opening 40-minutes against Japan. Australia are looking for energy to sustain them through the penultimate game of a long season and better discipline in a broad sense; Ireland for improved accuracy at the set piece and in handling. It’s what is missing rather than what’s there that’s generated the greater angst outside of the respective camps. The final word to Doris. “The World Cup rankings are done in December, so from that point of view it’s massively important but also in terms of continuing the belief and improvement. [To get the result] it’s got to be process-focused, performance-focused, so that is what we are putting our minds towards. It’s the consistency defensively and in what we’re doing in attack that needs to improve this weekend.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: AIL preview: Big Leinster names to feature in Dublin 6W derby face off

Like never before, the Dublin 6W derby has more than just local bragging rights at stake, as second-placed Terenure College host St Mary’s College at Lakelands Park (kick off 3pm) in an Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A summit meeting. St Mary’s arrive with five wins out of five, and 23 points out of a possible 25, while Terenure have won four of their five games to lie second on 21 points. Supporters of both came from far and wide last season when the clubs traded home wins in front of huge crowds for their first AIL derbies in seven years after St Mary’s returned to the top flight. Although some big Leinster names are among those featuring in this full programme of matches – weather permitting – the pity is that Terenure’s brilliant young halfbacks, Fintan Gunne and Caspar Gabriel, were not released. They were central figures to a third successive bonus point when beating high-flying Ballynahinch 52-12 away a fortnight ago. But they have a plethora of skilful, versatile backs and Carlos Spencer moves former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave, who scored a hat-trick in Ballynahinch, to outhalf. Caolan Cooley comes in at left wing, Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver returns, while Leinster have released hooker John McKee, with Oisín McCormack, Max Russell and returning captain Luke Clohessy forming a new backrow. St Mary’s have been boosted by the fitness of their captain/playmaker Conor Dean, injured in their 27-26 win over Con last time, while Mark McHugh brings in winger Aaron O’Sullivan, scrumhalf Colm Reilly and tighthead Mick McCormack as former Munster centre Dan Goggin continues at number eight. Reigning champions Clontarf sit third and travel to Cork Con in a repeat of last season’s final, with the home side in serious need of a win after three successive defeats. ‘Tarf welcome back Dylan O’Grady, Hugh Cooney and Alan Spicer. [ Joe Schmidt back on familiar ground as Wallabies face Ireland in DublinOpens in new window ] Lansdowne, in fourth, renew their age-old rivalry with Old Belvedere in Ollie Campbell Park, with Declan Fassbender’s one change from the side which beat Nenagh 62-17 being a notable one with Leinster’s Max Deegan in at number eight. Belvo make four changes, including Daragh O’Dywer at outhalf. UCD welcome Young Munster, with Andrew Osborne at fullback, while the Cookies welcomes Munster trio Shay McCarthy and halfbacks Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan. Promoted Nenagh Ormond, still winless, host Ballynahinch after contrasting Bateman Cup outings, the latter’s ruthless 78-0 win over Sligo regaining them momentum. Among the home side’s five changes, Charlie O’Doherty start at 10 and captain Kevin O’Flaherty returns at lock. Remarkably, there are also summit meeting in 1B, where leaders Old Wesley host a resurgent Trinity; in 2A when unbeaten Barnhall travel to Dungannon; in 2B where UL Bohs host Galwegians as the only two unbeaten sides and completing a double header in UL at 5pm, there is an identical match-up in the women’s division between UL Bohs, seeking a third successive title, and surprise leaders Galwegians. Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Ballynahinch, New Ormond Park; Old Belvedere v Lansdowne, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Young Munster, Belfield; Terenure College v St. Mary’s College, Lakelands Park, 3pm (IrishRugby+). Division 1B: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Instonians v Highfield, Shaw’s Bridge; Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Old Wesley v Dublin University, Energia Park; UCC v Queen’s, The Mardyke, 3pm.

Title: Domhnall Nugent: ‘This guy messaged to say that after I talked about addiction, he went to the GP and it saved his life’

The last time St John’s were in an Antrim county final, Domhnall Nugent went a bit viral. It was 2017 and it was the football final and the first thing to understand about it is that he wasn’t playing for St John’s. Rather, he was in the colours of Belfast rivals Lámh Dearg and neither club had won an Antrim title in the guts of a quarter-century. The second thing to understand is that Nugent was playing against not just some of his best friends and neighbours but also his family. His father Paddy was managing St John’s, his brother Pádraig was in goals. Finally, you must understand that he was 20 years old and he was an alcoholic, with all the chaos and bad decisions that entails. With 10 minutes to go and Lámh Dearg two points up, his brother Pádraig went to take a kick out for St John’s, only for Domhnall to run in and kick the ball away to waste time. It had the desired effect – Pádraig drew out and hit him, earning himself a red card. Domhnall got away with yellow for his messing and Lámh Dearg went on to see out the last 10 minutes against 14 men. He had his 15 minutes of social media infamy in the days that followed. In the eight years since, Domhnall Nugent has been to hell and back. He is six-and-a-half years sober, he has made it back to the Antrim hurling panel and won a Joe McDonagh medal, he is in a solid relationship with his girlfriend Amy and life is good. But it wasn’t until the St John’s hurlers played in the county final last month that he was able to box off that niggling page of the ledger. “I’m not gonna lie,” he says. “Lámh Deargh in 2017 against St John’s was in the middle of my madness. And honestly, there wasn’t one night I went to bed and didn’t think about that from then until the night before the county final a few weeks ago. “Honestly, I had forgiven myself for nearly everything. But not that. And I enjoyed my time with Lámh Dearg and it was good crack and there’s no bad blood or anything. It was just the way it sat for me. “My password on my old Bebo account used to be the 17.03.20 – basically, the 17th of March sometime in the 2020s. It was a way of saying I wanted to someday be in Croke Park on St Patrick’s Day in the club finals. That was always my thing. “So the relief that I got even off getting to a county final with St John’s was unbelievable. And then winning it, that was the first thing that came into my head. I get to celebrate this with everyone that I grew up with.” Nugent is 28 years old now and he is well and in a good place. Davy Fitzgerald is giving him a shot at being one of the goalkeepers on the Antrim panel over the winter, which may or may not work out but he’s up for taking it as far as he can anyway. He is also the current Down camogie manager, exercising a coaching muscle that he has been working on ever since he took a St John’s under-12 team when he was just 15. [ Davy Fitzgerald ‘more guarded’ after criticism over Antrim commentsOpens in new window ] But though he is in the planning stage with all that stuff, the here and now is about the St John’s senior hurlers. In beating Loughgiel a few weeks back, the Belfast club won their first hurling county title in 52 years. They’re more famous as a football club and sit on top of the Antrim roll of honour in the big ball code. But this is only their eighth hurling crown, five of which were won in a 12-year period in the 1960s and 70s. So when it happened, when half a century of nothing finally became something, Nugent threw off his helmet and tried to take it all in. He has a picture in his phone of the first person to reach him to celebrate – his brother Pádraig, fists clenched, mouth roared open. The circle squared. “It was just class,” Domhnall says. “But on the other side of it, a club championship like that is probably number one in most people’s things in life they want to do. But mine has to be my recovery. That’s where Amy came into it. We actually sat down before the final and we booked a flight for the Monday morning to go to Spain for 10 days. “We just got out the gap straight after the county final and that was it. Which was good. It’s good to have that support system where you’re going, ‘Right, you understand me – let’s get out of here.’ I went to St John’s for an hour after the match and then we went home and got a pizza and watched a movie. That was me, content and happy out.” Nugent has spent plenty of time talking in public about his struggles over the years. He did his first big interview with The Irish News back in 2019, a couple of months after coming out of Cuan Mhuire in Newry. He has done the rounds of national media days promoting Movember and the GPA’s mental health initiatives. And it has helped people. He knows it has. [ From the archive: Domhnall Nugent to take time from hurling to help run mental health campaignOpens in new window ] “Recently I got an email from a guy who was at the gig I did in Croke Park two years ago. I went to do the launch of the Ahead of the Game for Movember. This guy messaged me to say that the day after I talked about addiction at it, he went to the GP and it saved his life. So you just never know the impact that you can make on people’s lives. That’s what it was about.” Through it all, he hasn’t sugar-coated anything. He has talked about being homeless, about being addicted to drink and drugs, about lying to the people closest to him. Stories of blowing thousands of pounds, of being left with nothing, of scrabbling around McDonald’s late at night looking to swipe leftover chicken nuggets. He has been brave and open and unflinching. Sometimes to a fault. “I was probably naive for myself. It was the right thing to do for other people, but I’m probably not so sure it was always the right thing to do for me. One, for my recovery and two, for my hurling. “I probably got put on a pedestal and probably pigeonholed myself as someone who was in recovery, someone who was in addiction. And kind of forgot about, ‘Oh, I actually need to work on being fitter or stronger and my touch needs to be better and I need to get better finishing.’ And all these things that I probably didn’t really think about much. “The other part of it, the validation part, that’s probably something that I kind of grabbed on to. People saying to me, ‘Oh, you’re great for speaking out and you’re this and you’re that.’ In some ways, that’s the same thing I was getting from drinking. “It’s two different things but it’s the same feeling. You’re being validated by a substance, whether that’s a human substance or a drink or a drug. So I probably grabbed on to that a wee bit too much. Then all of a sudden, you’re on social media and you’re a wee bit more active on Instagram and waiting on likes and comments because it’s like you’re chasing something. “But listen – do I regret it? No. I definitely would do it again because I know the impact that it’s all had. And there’s been a wee bit of growing up along the way too because I was so young when I got into rehab. I forget that. I forget that I’m six-and-a-half years sober and I’m 28.” Does it get easier? Not really. Or at least, that’s not really how he frames it. Sobriety isn’t a done deal. The lease runs out every night and you start again on a new agreement the next day. It isn’t about easier or harder. It’s just what he has to do. “I want to be very honest with you,” he says. “I think about drink a lot. There wouldn’t be a week in the past six and a half years where I wouldn’t have thought about having a drink. Or going, ‘Jesus, I’d love a pint.’ Or even a wee whiskey. I do think about it regularly. “Sometimes I dream about it and wake up the next morning, tasting Jameson down the back of my throat. You’d wake up sweating and afraid that you’ve relapsed and stuff like that. “So it’s definitely something that is still in me. And I’m just really, really good at the minute. I’m so happy I can say that now because I probably wouldn’t have before. Like, I’m so good and proud that I’m managing it really well through AA and through my friend group, the people who I surround myself with. “I’m so lucky. I’m in a good relationship and I have Amy and things are really, really good. She understands me and I understand her. But it took me a long time to be able to let someone into that journey with me. Even whenever I was sober, I was half-letting people in and getting afraid and pushing them off and doing mad things, stupid things. Just because I wasn’t comfortable. “I always just talk about this journey of no destination. That’s where I’m at. This journey doesn’t have a destination. Obviously it’s great, this kind of fairytale of winning a club championship. That’s brilliant. But that can’t be the journey. External things can’t be the journey. It has to start with you and end with you.” So on he goes and on they go. St John’s have only ever played one Ulster club hurling match – when they won Antrim in 1973, they went out the next day and trounced Ballygalget of Down before getting a walkover in the final against Dungiven. The following March they went all the way down to Cork where Blackrock beat them by 19 points in the All-Ireland semi-final. They start this weekend against Donegal club Setanta and after that, they can only go the only way he knows. One day at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tadhg Beirne: ‘There’s so much more in us - we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment’

Tadhg Beirne tells a story about Johann van Graan replacing him around the hour mark back in his second season with Munster. Beirne had arrived in Munster in 2016, and Van Graan a year later. They were still getting to know each other and the Monday after replacing him, the coach was about to learn more about Beirne. “I went into his office,” recalls Beirne, “and I was like: ‘Why did you take me off?’ And he was like: ‘I just felt you looked like you needed to come off.’ And I was like: ‘Yeah? I feel like I’m an 80-minute player’.” From that day on, Beirne became one of Van Graan’s 80-minute men. Last season, Beirne completed 80 minutes in all bar one of his 16 starts for Munster, when coming off for the last three minutes away to Ulster. Ditto in his nine starts as an ever-present for Ireland, save for a HIA against Scotland. On the Lions tour he played every minutes of the Tests, after which he was voted player of the series, and played more minutes than any other member of the squad. In all, Beirne played 2,544 minutes last season. In George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which Beirne read as part of his Leaving Cert back in the day, you suggest he would have to be the horse, aka Boxer. He laughs. Did he ever feel tired? “I think I did at times. But by the time the games come around, you’re okay.” You can understand why van Graan felt compelled to replace him. At times on the pitch – maybe it’s the headgear or the gait – he looks shattered. [ Tadhg Beirne happy to crown ‘season full of ups and downs’ with men’s player of the year nodOpens in new window ] “I feel like, often, towards the end of the game is when I can probably express myself a bit more. I suppose you’re probably watching people around you start to diminish a bit. I never feel so tired that I need to come off. I’m just ‘next play’. I don’t know what it is.” He reveals one extreme example. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bad physically as I did after the first Lions Test, and through that whole week. When I got to the Friday, during the captain’s run I was like: ‘Actually this is the worst I’ve felt going into a game’. But then, within the next 24 hours it just got better. The adrenaline kicked in, but that was definitely the worst I’d felt in a long time.” Playing every minute of a Lions’ Test series win made up for being restricted to a combined 16 minutes in two appearances off the bench in a losing series behind closed doors four years earlier. In Australia there was the added bonus of his wife Harriet being there, and were his three sisters, Jennifer, Alannah and Caoimhe (who all lived there at the time) and his parents, Brenda and Gerry. “My older sister’s fiancé was there, younger sister’s boyfriend was there as well, and then I had my aunt and godmother [Fiona] and uncle [Tomás] and their daughter Orla was out as well.” And so too were his cousins Leigh, who lives in Perth, and Cillian. “We are really close, and I’m the only boy, and it’s great for my parents who are retired.” In truth he hasn’t had a day with Ireland or Munster quite like that, but he’s not done yet. The end of a playing career is often related to its beginning. One ventures Johnny Sexton played on until he was 38 in part because he didn’t make his breakthrough with Leinster until he was 23 and with Ireland when he was 24. Similarly, Beirne had played plenty of rugby with the Irish Under-20s and in the AIL, but he was 23 when his career took off with the Scarlets, and 26 when he made his Ireland debut. Last Saturday, Beirne was one of five Ireland players from Kildare in the matchday 23, and in that sense is something of a trailblazer. It’s always been more of a GAA county. “Gaelic and soccer were my two main sports as a kid. Then I tried rugby when I was in fifth class and hated it, so I quit after a month.” All changed when he went to Clongowes. “Rugby was compulsory, so you end up playing, and then you see the senior cup team and all of a sudden you’re in awe.” He had so many sliding doors moments. On leaving school he went into the Leinster system. They’d just created a Bs team which led to two years in the sub-academy with Dave Fagan before three seasons in the full academy. Injuries blighted his three years in the academy, and his lack of bulk. “It was a different game as well. It was very size-orientated and that’s not something I had at the time. I came out of Clongowes at 78kg. If you see pictures of me back then, I’m skin and bone. This morning, I was 120kg!” During his time in the academy, as well as delivering pizza, coaching Blackrock and studying, Beirne played for Lansdowne Under-20s and senior team, with whom he won two AIL medals in 2012-13 and 2014-15, beating Clontarf in both finals, although he was benched for the second one. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster “I was on the bench. I didn’t turn up for training the week before the final and Mike Ruddock dropped me.” Was Ruddock right? “Probably, yeah. I was a bit young and dumb. I think I went to the Trinity Ball the night before.” The following season, Leinster opted to sign Ian Nagle and keep Hayden Triggs, thereby releasing Beirne. “I remember walking off the field in UCD on my own knowing it was my last session. It was emotional, just knowing it was done.” As he was doing his master’s, he told his agent that he had to stay in the Pro12 or England. The Scarlets came in for him, he flew to Wales, met Wayne Pivac and accepted the only rugby offer on the table. “They signed me for very little money,” he says, laughing. After two great years there, winning a Pro12 and Pro12 player of the season, Beirne was within one more season of becoming Welsh qualified when Munster stepped in. Having made his international debut at the age of 26 in Australia, he was part of that series win and also the series win in New Zealand in 2023, and the Grand Slam earlier that year when sidelined with an ankle injury for the last three games. “Obviously it was class to be out there,” he says of the St Patrick’s Day coronation after beating England in the Aviva. “But I’m hobbling around. I’m in a [moon]boot.” There was also the Six Nations title in 2024, a host of landmark wins and individual awards, as well as Munster’s 2022-23 URC title and becoming Munster’s captain. Yet, he sounds more driven than ever. Beirne has unfinished business and though he could yet play until he’s 40, not a huge amount of time to do so. Everything [Clayton McMillan] has been doing is brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities “Ideally, we could have won a lot more. There’s been ups and downs, and that’s well documented in Munster. The quality of the squads we’ve had, we probably should have achieved a bit more. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster. “I thought Johann was incredible when he was in there. At times he got a hard rap for what he did, but in terms of the circumstances and what he was producing, it was very impressive.” Like seemingly all at Munster, Beirne is hugely enthused by the arrival of Clayton McMillan this season. “Last year was a difficult year and I think the freshness that he’s brought in and the way he’s doing things, the way he sees the game, simplifying it in many ways for a lot of players, takes a lot of pressure off them. Everything he’s doing has been brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities. It all adds to a happier, healthier squad.” On Saturday evening Beirne comes up against another significantly influential coach in his career in Joe Schmidt, who gave him his debut in 2018. “I feared Joe. I think most people did. Did he make me a better player? Yeah, 100 per cent, because of the detail part. That’s what everyone speaks about, and it’s the same with Faz [Andy Farrell].” Farrell took the team on to another level with that 17-game winning run and the number one ranking. This team have many of the same personnel without quite scaling those heights since, but Beirne maintains: “We’re in a really good place. I think we’re evolving in the right way, in the way we attack and defend. “I think there’s so much more in us and we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment. I still think we’re one of the best teams in the world for sure. I think we just need to chase it, to go out and prove it.” [ Andy Farrell hits the refresh button hoping to breath new life into IrelandOpens in new window ] And, eh, the lineout malfunctions? “I was calling the lineouts [against Japan], and it was just individual errors all around. The first one was an overthrow. It’s tough, that happens. “And then we proceeded to have two calls when lads misheard the call. It makes the lineout look like a shambles, but they’re the easiest things to fix up. So all of a sudden, I’m trying to be clearer with my voice, so that they don’t mishear me again.” That also happened for the one lineout he called in Soldier Field against the All Blacks before, of course, his third-minute yellow card when Beauden Barrett ran into him was wrongly upgraded into a 20-minute red card, which has been since rescinded. [ Ireland’s unconvincing Japan jobOpens in new window ] “When it happened, I was like: ‘Oh, I felt him on my shoulder there’. I remember saying to the lads in the huddle: ‘I think it’s a penalty. I may end up going off for a yellow card, I don’t know’.” Initially an official told Beirne it would only be a yellow before subsequently confirming that, like all yellow cards, it would go to a bunker review. “It wasn’t until he came up to me probably 30 seconds before I started warming up and he was like: ‘You have a red card.’ I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ It was a bit of a shock.” James Lowe has described the Rugby World Cup in 2027 as his North Star. Is that Beirne’s, or has his eye on a third Lions tour in 2029? “The Lions could be a push but the way I’m feeling I don’t see it [the World Cup] as my North Star now. I see it as the next thing to strive for. I don’t see it as an ending, if you get me. I just see it as the next big competition, especially after the last World Cup, to hopefully right the wrongs of that World Cup.” “It still haunts me,” he admits of that epic 28-24 quarter-final loss to New Zealand, when a 37-phase Irish attack culminated in Wayne Barnes awarding Sam Whitelock a jackal penalty, even though he clearly didn’t release after tackling Rónan Kelleher. “It wasn’t a penalty. Well,” Beirne corrects himself with a smile. “It was a penalty for us.” It would be nice to go back to Australia and create more special memories in front of family and friends in two years’ time? “That’s the goal.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Celebrated illustrated history of the 15th century to be sold at Offaly auction

Antiquarian book dealers and academic libraries across Europe and the United States have already been in contact with Conor Purcell in advance of his auction of books – almost all of which belonged to one collector – on Wednesday, November 26th. As is so often the case, the sellers of The Library of An Irish Gentleman won’t reveal themselves. But, I expect some savvy collectors and local aficionados might know the provenance of these ancient books, such as the first edition of the Nuremberg Chronicle, printed in July 1493 (€20,000-€30,000). Conor Purcell of Purcell auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, says that it will be the first time that a copy of what is deemed to be the most extensively illustrated 15th century book, has ever been offered for sale at auction in Ireland. A pictorial history of the world, the Nuremberg Chronicle (known in German as Schedelsche Weltchronik or Schedel’s World History) was originally written in Latin by medical doctor and book collector, Hartmann Schedel. It includes woodcut illustrations of biblical scenes, early maps of Europe and the world and some of the first created topographical views of towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East. Nuremberg was one of the largest cities in central and western Europe in the 1490s. Around 400 copies of the original Latin version of the book are believed to be still in existence.Purcell says the 1587 edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles (€10,000-€20,000) – another highly collectable book in the auction – is a “cornerstone of English Renaissance historiography”. Compiled by Raphael Holinshed, these historical accounts of England, Scotland and Ireland would have been a primary source of material for writers such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Edmund Spenser. Another highlight is a 1512 edition of a book of hours written in Latin and French (€5,000-€10,000). Books of hours were early Christian prayer books used by those who prayed at specific times of the day (known as canonical hours) in the monastic tradition. This book of hours includes fifteen prayers of St Brigid. During the Covid pandemic, Purcell Auctioneers began selling more and more books as they were easier to sell online and dispatch around the world. This dedication to book selling has paid off, as they have since sold the libraries of many public figures including the late politicians, Conor Cruise O’Brien and Garret FitzGerald, the late journalist, Bruce Arnold and the late owner of Grogan’s pub on Dublin’s South William St, Tommy Smith. “We take all the books from sellers, as intact book collections will absolutely create higher value as they gives a true reflection of the collecting nuances of each collector,” says Purcell. The two volumes of Christian Art in Ancient Ireland (Saorstat Eireann, 1932) compiled by the German archaeologist, Adolf Mahr (€80-€160) is another fascinating book in the Purcell auction. Mahr was a director of the National Museum of Ireland in the 1930s, but was later dismissed when he became leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter. Other books of interest include The Odyssey of Homer and the Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope and printed in 1715 (€1,000-€1,500), several editions of Paradise Lost by John Milton, and The Plays of William Shakespeare in ten volumes (€200-€400). De Búrca Rare Books, based in Blackrock, Co Dublin, also have a vast collections of historic and contemporary books of Irish interest for potential Christmas gifts. Meanwhile, Gormleys auctions is hosting a sale of paintings and prints by Irish and international artists on Tuesday, November 25th at 7.30pm. Gerard Gormley says that the sale reflects the increasing demand for original prints by well established artists. “Collectors recognise the accessibility, rarity and artistic integrity of prints which often provide an entry point in the market,” he says. Highlights at Gormley’s auction – which is on view at 57 Francis St, Dublin from November 19th-25th (10am-5.30pm daily except Sunday, which is 12pm-4pm) include Banksy’s satirical screen print, Morons (€15,000-€20,000). “The piece has become emblematic of Banksy’s critique of consumerism and the commodification of art, while paradoxically commanding significant value in the very market it ridicules,” says Gormley. Patrick Scott’s Tangram 1, one of three pieces using gold leaf (€3,000-€5,000), is also for sale. Finally, Christmas present hunters will no doubt find some potential purchases at the R.

Share this article Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard University’s endowment, boosted its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings to $442.8 million in Q3 2025, marking a 257% expansion in its crypto exposure, according to a new SEC filing. The prestigious institution’s Bitcoin ETF increase demonstrates growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a portfolio asset. The university’s substantial investment reflects broader adoption trends among major financial institutions, which have been increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into traditional investment portfolios since the products became available in early 2024. The filing also disclosed 661,391 shares of the GLD gold ETF worth $235 million, up 99% from the 333,000 shares reported in June. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Job Prospects for 2026 College Grads to Hit 5-Year Low While Employers Eye AI, Foreign Labor
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/11/14/job-prospects-2026-college-grads-hit-five-year-low-employers-eye-ai-foreign-labor/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T02:52:25Z
Full Content:
The outlook for the college graduating class of 2026 has dimmed sharply as data shows employer hiring plans have stalled, job market ratings have slipped, and workforce competition has intensified due to automation and visa-based labor programs. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, based on data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), employers project the job market for 2026 graduates will be the weakest in half a decade. A survey conducted among 183 companies between August 7 and September 22 found that 51 percent of respondents rated the job market for new graduates as “poor” or “fair,” a sentiment not seen at this level since the COVID-19-era downturn in 2020-21. Only two percent of employers rated the market as “excellent.” The hiring slowdown follows a wave of large-scale layoffs from major employers, including Amazon, UPS, and Verizon — the latter reportedly preparing to cut 15,000 jobs, its largest workforce reduction ever. While overall hiring for 2026 graduates is technically expected to increase by 1.6 percent, that marks a steep drop from earlier projections for the Class of 2025. Historical trends show that spring hiring often falls short of earlier fall estimates. The divergence is reflected in NACE’s year-over-year hiring projections: from a near 30 percent jump in 2022 spring plans compared to 2021, projections have since plummeted, including a contraction for the Class of 2024. According to data from job platform Handshake, full-time job postings in August dropped over 16 percent year-over-year, while applications per job rose 26 percent. Over 60 percent of 2026 graduates surveyed reported pessimism about their career outlooks. Former recruiter Giavanna Vega, who was laid off from Automation Anywhere in 2023, said companies “don’t know where to invest” amid AI uncertainty and tariffs. “They don’t have the training,” she remarked about recent graduates, many of whom are being passed over for roles that are increasingly filled by laid-off mid-career professionals. The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit 4.8 percent in June, the highest in four years and above the national average. New college graduates are now not only competing with each other, but also with recently laid-off workers and foreign graduates entering the U.S. workforce through visa programs. Rising scrutiny of visa programs such as H-1B and OPT (Optional Practical Training) has enabled hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work in U.S. jobs originally intended for American college students. The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has pledged increased enforcement of longstanding visa-related laws to curb what officials describe as the systemic replacement of domestic talent. Eric Sell, a senior lawyer at the DOJ Civil Rights Division, emphasized that the administration is determined to hold companies accountable for how they treat American workers, especially during periods of economic upheaval and rapid technological change. He stressed that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, technological advancement would “never be used as an excuse to forget the workers that built this country,” and he warned that those attempting to exploit chaotic growth for corporate gain “will be held accountable.” Public frustration has been intensifying. A new Cygnal poll finds that 44 percent of likely voters say companies exploit the H-1B system. Among swing voters, 43 percent agree with that assessment. Notably, the backlash against these visa programs is strongest among working-class Americans and voters without a college degree, key electoral constituencies ahead of the 2026 midterms. In 2024 alone, the Biden administration approved work permits for approximately 400,000 foreign college graduates through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program — a 45 percent increase from 2020 levels under President Trump. Former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and other Trump administration officials have warned that programs like OPT are depressing wages and displacing American graduates, particularly in high-demand STEM and business fields. The pipeline from foreign student to U.S. worker also begins at the admissions level. Breitbart News opinion contributor Rich Kaye questioned why taxpayer-funded public universities are increasingly filling seats with international students who later convert F-1 student visas into work permits. “When a public university replaces a Georgia student with an F‑1 student in a high‑demand field,” Kaye wrote, “it increases the pipeline pressure tomorrow for H‑1B allocations in exactly the sectors where Americans could be trained to fill roles.” That pressure is already being felt by recent graduates like Nalin Haley, who told UnHerd that many in his peer group are struggling just to get started. “It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one,” he stated. “I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: ICE has not yet purchased translation technology promised for new agents

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Immigration and Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology that it promised would replace a Spanish-language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials. In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new, “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportation policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week Spanish course. ICE had considered providing officers with AI-powered translation services that can be used on body-worn cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS officials said. The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said. The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides. The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said. “Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.” The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English. While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology. The police department in Joliet, Illinois, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise. Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages. Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement. “Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News. Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them. In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover. Jason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish-language skills for agents increases the chances of dangerous encounters. “That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said. With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish-language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in Texas, it’s mandatory for all police officers. In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll out body cameras to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to go beyond that initial 1,600. In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say. In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?” In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News. Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.” “Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor. The police department in Corpus Christi, Texas, where less than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer. “It’s very important, because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.” Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training. “Spanish-language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary — it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful and more effective.” Laura Strickler is the senior investigative producer on the national security team where she produces television stories and writes for NBCNews.com.

Title: The Bubble Teeters

Time Published: 2025-11-14T23:00:52Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 14, 2025 Is the stock market bubble about to burst? It has seemed that way a few times over the past year, but so far each selloff has proved to be a blip on a relentless climb upwards. But now we’re starting to see signs of weakness in the sector that’s driving markets higher: AI/tech. Investors are beginning to digest that there’s simply not enough electricity in America to support endless new data center construction. And all the debt being raised by “hyperscalers” like Oracle and Meta is causing skeptics to question whether ROI will ever materialize. OpenAI’s co-founder/CEO Sam Altman raised eyebrows back on November 2nd when he seemingly had no answer about how he planned to spend $1.4 trillion on infrastructure with around $20 billion in annual revenue (and huge losses). Could this be the beginning stages of a crash? Sure. Alternatively, could it be another bear trap, like we saw in March/April? Also yes. Today we’re going to survey the latest market action, take a worrying look at the health of the American economy, and review ways to hedge for a crash (without necessarily shorting). The Magnificent 7 (Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet/Google, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft) are down around 10% from the highs, on average. A fairly typical correction so far. But second-tier AI/tech plays are taking larger hits. These stocks were red hot just a few months ago: The most speculative sectors of the market have taken a beating over the past few weeks. Whether this drawdown is the start of a crash, or a simple correction remains to be seen. I’m not buying the dip in U.S. tech or broad markets, nor do I plan to anytime soon. But I’m not shorting it in size either. This week I bought a few puts, but they’re very small for now. Just testing the water with some hedges. Eventually the time may come for a more substantial short position, but we’re not there yet. The risk of a “blow-off top” before the bubble pops is still there. My plan hasn’t changed. I’m heavily positioned in precious metals, miners, hard assets, and select emerging markets. With some cash on hand to take advantage of any market dislocations. One of the most concerning signals is seeing the real American economy barely treading water, despite record stock market strength. First up, layoffs are spiking: Source: Charlie Bilello We’re not at 2008 or 2020 levels yet, but the recent pace of layoff announcements is disturbing. And the most recent consumer sentiment survey out of the University of Michigan is hideous. It’s at the second-lowest level in the survey’s history going back to 1952. Source: UMich Consumers are burnt out. Inflation and a weak job market have taken their toll. And if sentiment is this bad during a bubble, what happens if we get a crash and recession? It’s unusual to see sentiment so low with stocks so high. Another sign that all is not well is the fact that the median U.S. homebuyer is now 59 years old. In 1980, that number was 31. Young people are priced out of the housing market. And as the chart below shows, this is having devastating effects on the percentage of 30-year-olds who are both married and homeowners. From 52% in 1950 to 13% today. A shameful indictment of our country’s trajectory. Despite stocks near record highs, all is not well beneath the surface. This is not a market where I want to be in overpriced stocks. I want plenty of exposure to precious metals and miners. And cheap emerging market stocks with fat yields, like Brazil. Of course, I do have some exposure to U.S. markets, mostly through retirement accounts. But during times like these, I want to hedge that exposure with alternative investments. Because when crashes happen, the hottest stocks get hit the hardest. And based on everything I’m seeing, we’re overdue. Remember that in mid-2022, markets were falling sharply. The Nasdaq 100 had dropped about 33% from its highs in late 2021. In November of 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, giving birth to the AI bubble. Since then the Nasdaq 100 is up 130%. AI saved the stock market, for a while at least. If investors begin to lose faith in the AI story, it could spell trouble. When we add in the economic signals above, I’m maintaining a bearish outlook.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Title: Ireland Under-20s battle hard but are beaten by physical South Africa

South Africa were worthy winners, their physical edge in the set piece, scrum and lineout, a significant factor against a gutsy Ireland side that produced several passages of excellent rugby but ultimately were undone by a propensity to make mistakes. Both teams deserve credit for the rugby they produced in horrendous weather at Musgrave Park. The visitors, with the backing of a gale, started with purpose and power and while the home side survived that prolonged assault, a penalty from a ruck offence, offside, gave outhalf Vusi Moyo a long range, wind-assisted opportunity, which he landed with plenty to spare. Ireland lost Arthur Ashmore after 10 minutes, the Terenure man had made one superb carry before his departure with a shoulder injury, but his replacement Cahersiveen’s Michael O’Sullivan in his first action put in a superb tackle. Centres Sean Walsh and Johnny O’Sullivan, secondrow Dylan McNiece, number eight Diarmaid O’Connell and tighthead prop Sam Bishti excelled in the collisions and manufactured positive gain-lines, the only cavil was that scrumhalf Chris Barrett needed to be a little sharper at times to clear the ball. Right wing Charlie Molony, one of the returning players from last season, was a delight to watch, his ability to leave defenders with a handful of nothing roused the hardy home support, while fullback Noah Byrne was another who excelled. Ireland outhalf Tom Wood, in his second season at this level, kicked a 40-metre penalty, a staggering effort into the teeth of the elements to bring the sides level. South Africa though were quickly in the ascendancy once again when hooker Siphosethu Mnebelele barged over for a try, following a well-crafted maul. Moyo kicked a fine conversion to give South Africa a 10-3 lead. Wood, whose astute kicking game had caused problems for the visitors, had the chance to reduce the deficit after McNeice made another super carry but the Irish outhalf was unable to post the 22-metre penalty that ensued. Just before halftime South Africa were very fortunate not to be reduced to 14 players. Irish outhalf Wood was taken out in the air by right wing Khuthadzo Rasivhaga. It looked like a red card offence, no attempt to legitimately contest possession, running underneath the player and causing Wood to land on his back and head. That French referee Julien Caulier and his assistant no more than a couple of feet from the incident decided to award a knock-on beggared belief. After a prolonged period of treatment, the Irish outhalf gingerly walked from the pitch to be replaced by Conor O’Shaughnessy. Ireland got the perfect start to the second half, centre Walsh breaking a tackle en route to the try line. O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 10-10 two minutes after the restart. The home side were guilty of some sloppy play thereafter, basic mistakes and poor decisions and it cost them dearly; two tries, one converted, both from mauls, 12-points and a yellow card for Michael O’Sullivan. Ireland responded positively, a brilliant break from Byrne the precursor to a try for O’Connell. Phiwayinkosi Kubheka barged over for a try, after another Irish error, converted by Moyo as the visitors got a reward for their scrum and general forward dominance. Centre Johnny O’Sullivan hauled his side back into the game on 68-minutes, sharp in blocking down Pieter van der Merwe and collecting the loose ball to dot down for a try, one that O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 22-29. But yet another Irish mistake gave Moyo a chance to tag on another three points with a penalty, a healthy 32-22 lead for the visitors going into the last 10 minutes.

Title: Should you worry about an AI bubble? Investment pros weigh in.

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 14, 2025 / 4:31 PM EST / CBS News Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust. The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. Thursday's stock market tumble — when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months — fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble. Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability. "The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it," Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called "Magnificent 7" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI. "No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped," Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email. Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is "roughly half" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s. "So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble," they noted. The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting. "This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said. "So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies." Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say. "We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains," Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News. For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a "4th industrial revolution" that could supercharge economic growth. "This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026," he wrote this week in a research note. "The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology," Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Title: Binance adds BlackRock’s BUIDL as off-exchange collateral for institutional traders

The integration marks another step in centralized exchanges adopting tokenized Treasurys, expanding RWA collateral across major trading platforms. Binance has begun accepting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as off-exchange collateral, giving institutions a way to trade on the exchange while keeping their assets with custodians. The integration combines BlackRock’s onchain money market fund with Binance’s custody systems, enabling traders to earn yield on BUIDL while using it to support trading positions on the exchange. A new BUIDL asset class will also launch on BNB Chain, expanding the token’s reach beyond Ethereum and opening it to a wider set of onchain applications, according to a blog post by Binance on Friday. With the addition of BUIDL, Binance supports multiple yield-bearing tokenized assets, including Circle’s USYC and OpenEden’s cUSDO. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first onchain liquidity fund — a tokenized, interest-bearing USD vehicle issued through Securitize. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversaw roughly $13.4 trillion in assets as of Q3 2025. Related: Securitize to go public in $1.25B BlackRock-backed merger As tokenized money-market funds shift from simple yield products to mainstream trading collateral, Binance joins a growing group of exchanges allowing qualified clients to post Treasury-backed tokens to back their positions. In July, Deribit and Crypto.com began accepting BUIDL as collateral, giving institutional traders a low-volatility, yield-bearing asset they can use in place of cash or stablecoins. In September, Bybit followed with support for QCDT, a Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)-approved tokenized money-market fund backed by US Treasurys. The trend echoes traditional finance, where companies often pledge Treasurys and money-market funds as collateral through bank-run triparty systems rather than keeping assets on a trading venue. Tokenized US Treasurys have become the second-largest real-world assets (RWA) beyond stablecoins, with a current market cap of $8.57 billion, according to RWA.xyz data. The funds are led by BlackRock’s BUIDL, with about $2.52 billion in total value, Circle’s USYC with $1.06 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $850 million.

THE OLDEST EVER recruit to graduate from the Garda College has encouraged other people his age to “go for it”. Jeremiah Bourke, 51, said he wanted to join the gardaí when he was younger but missed the opportunity. He said he recognises it is going to be a “tough job”, but said: “You’re never too old. “If you’re able, why not? Give it a go. I’d say to anybody out there, if you want to go for it – go for it.” He added: “I’ve done it, anyone can do it.” Bourke said he had always had hope that he could become a garda, so re-applied when the recruiting age limit increased from 35 to 50 at the start of last year. He was within that age range when he applied. “I was in the retail business and wanted to give that a chance, but unfortunately as time goes fast the closing date for the competition passed me by.” He added: “I didn’t miss the bus time – and here I am attesting today at a later stage.” He said it was “not easy” and “a bit daunting” to go through the training alongside younger recruit, but said he was supported by his wife and two children as well as all those at the College. He was one of 194 gardaí attesting from the Templemore Garda College in Co Tipperary on Friday. Among them, Garda Amy Ni Riada was eager to get “stuck in” after trading in a career in the media to join An Garda Síochána. The former RTÉ journalist, from Castleisland in Co Kerry, said she developed a taste for working in high-pressure environments and a role with variety. Garda Amy Ni Riada, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo She was inspired to join the gardaí seeing the response to the November 2023 riots in Dublin. “It was an eye opener for me that I wanted to be stuck in and got involved in that way.” Advertisement Ni Riada, who will be stationed in Midleton, Co Cork, also said being in An Garda Síochána was perfect” for her desire to work with the most vulnerable people in society, having previously reported on climate change, social issues and violence against women in east Africa. They were among 194 new gardaí and 17 garda reserves attesting from the Garda College in Templemore on Friday. It is the largest single attestation of new gardaí since 2019 and the college will also see its largest class of recruits in a decade enter next week. Garda Kristina Courtney also left a career in communications and media production to join the gardaí. She said she was inspired to join after getting an insight into the operations of An Garda Síochána by working on RTÉ’s Crimecall programme. Garda Amy Ni Riada (left) and Kristina Courtney, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Part of her role involved making actors “look like the bad guys”. Asked how she felt about dealing with real bad guys, she replied: “I’m up for the challenge.” Dubliner Adam O’Rourke said he joined An Garda Síochána because he wanted a career where he could help people and challenge himself. Garda O’Rourke, from Walkinston, previously served with the Defence Forces in Lebanon. Now being stationed in Blackrock, Dublin, he said he was happy to start making a difference in the community: “It is a fantastic day, I couldn’t be happier.” Speaking at the Garda College, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said it was a “great honour” to “witness the continued growth of An Garda Síochána and to welcome its newest members”. Of the 194 attesting on Friday, 137 are men and 57 are women and the new probationers will be assigned to divisions across the country by the Garda Commissioner. Of the new gardai, 87 will be deployed across the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with 47 going to the Southern Region, 39 to the Eastern Region and 21 to North Western Region.

Title: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander Presses Spotify On ICE Recruitment Ads

We'll keep digging -- no matter who wants the truth buried. Become a HuffPost member and fuel reporting they can’t silence. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk New York City’s chief financial officer wrote to Spotify Thursday to press the company for details about the recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have been running on the platform in recent weeks. Comptroller Brad Lander, a recent mayoral candidate and notable supporter of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, wrote to Spotify “about recent developments that may violate Spotify’s advertising policies and impact long-term shareholder value.” Specifically, Lander wants to know about ICE recruitment ads on Spotify, which he wrote have “sparked widespread backlash and at least one major national organization is urging Spotify users to cancel their subscription,” a reference to Indivisible’s “Don’t Stream Fascism: Cancel Spotify” campaign. “In too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down,” says one version of the ad, which was recorded by a TikTok user and archived by fact-checking site Snopes. “Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst, with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now.” “From a fiduciary perspective,” Lander wrote, he is “concerned about the reputational risks these ads may create for the company, which could hamper long-term growth, and [wants] to better understand how the company assessed these ads against the company’s stated advertising policies.” Lander wrote that the pension funds “hold significant investments in Spotify.” A spokesperson for his office said that, taken together, the funds have 691,681 shares of Spotify, worth $482,793,542 as of Sept. 30. Spotify’s share price has fallen slightly since then. A Spotify spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement: “This ad itself is part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms, including television, streaming, and online channels. Users can help control their ad experience by liking or disliking an ad or by logging into their account via web browser and updating their ad preferences.” Lander’s letter asks Spotify how it assessed the ads’ against company policy prohibiting “systemic discrimination and marginalization,” and whether the company has assessed “the impact of this controversy on subscriber retention, artist relationships, or brand perception,” among other inquiries. “Hopefully what we’ll get is good answers to the questions we’re asking,” Lander told HuffPost in an interview Friday morning. He characterized the letter as an initial engagement between a representative of New York City employee pension funds — as comptroller, Lander is a trustee of each of the five funds — and a company in which those funds have an investment stake. If Spotify doesn’t have a satisfactory response to his questions, Lander said, the city’s funds could work with other investors to press Spotify for answers or consider a shareholder resolution to do so. “In some cases [in the past], where we have been unable to get answers we are looking for, or have a satisfactory engagement, we have divested from, or sold the stock of, particular companies or sectors,” he said. “We only do that after a lot of engagement. Our strong preference is to use our position as investors to reach resolution. We do this from a responsible fiduciary perspective, believing that what we’re doing is helping increase the value of the companies we’re invested in … we’re just starting here, this is the first letter we’re writing.” The comptroller said he is concerned with systemic discrimination in the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” agenda — “and that includes any ads,” he said. “The mass deportation effort involves a broadscale hiring effort to make ICE the largest law enforcement agency in American history.” Lander noted a trend of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being arrested by immigration agents. “Essentially every time, [it is] a person of color, without, so far as we can tell, lawful basis for many of the arrests,” he said. “If you are conducting arrests without lawful basis, and they are consistently of people of one ethnicity, that is a systemic civil rights violation — and I believe these ads are part of it,” he added. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, doesn’t advertise exclusively with Spotify. Recruitment ads to become an immigration agent have also appeared on platforms including X, YouTube, LinkedIn and Meta, and on cable television, The Independent noted. Separately, DHS has spent millions of dollars on advertising pressuring people to “self-deport.” Lander said Thursday’s letter was specifically regarding Spotify’s “quite strong anti-discrimination policy — and we’re asking for how they assess these ads against that.” Lander’s letter amounts to a shot across the bow for Spotify. As comptroller, he has a legal “fiduciary” obligation to act in the best financial interests of New York City’s pension funds. As well as trustee, the comptroller serves as an investment advisor and custodian for the five funds — one each for police, firefighters, educators, non-pedagogical educational workers, and other city workers. While he does not have unilateral control over the pension funds, he has influence over the funds’ administration. Lander noted that the five funds’ responsible investing program is staffed by the comptroller’s office and that “we do a letter like this in consultation with our boards.” Combined, the funds have over $300 billion in assets under management, making them the fourth largest public pension plan in the country, according to the comptroller’s office. Lander’s office shared the letter, which is addressed to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, with HuffPost. Lander himself has been arrested by federal agents twice in recent months at the immigration court in lower Manhattan, where agents have been systematically arresting migrants showing up for scheduled court check-ins — and where Lander frequently observes proceedings. “We owe it to the families of those detained — and every New Yorker impacted by Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine — to keep showing up and demanding accountability for the violence, cruelty, and lawless abduction of our neighbors,” he said last month after pressing DHS for answers about the return to duty of one particularly violent officer. Spotify isn’t only facing pressure over the ICE advertisements. Ek’s venture capital firm, Prima Materia, recently led a 600 million euro funding round for Helsing, a European military technology company, which led to an exodus of artists from the platform.

Title: Walmart's CEO retires: How Doug McMillion transformed the retail giant

Time Published: 2025-11-14T18:32:35Z
Full Content:
David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images With Walmart CEO Doug McMillon set to retire early next year and be replaced by company veteran John Furner, it’s worth a look at where the company stands after McMillon’s 11-year tenure at the helm. McMillon has left a significant mark on Walmart and on the wider retail sector. David Haigh, CEO at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation company, provides some numbers that Walmart racked up under McMillon’s leadership: Walmart’s stock price is also a big piece of McMillon’s legacy. During his tenure, Walmart's shares rose by 310%, beating both the S&P 500 and its retail competitors. “The retirement of Doug McMillon will send a small shock wave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company,” Neil Saunders, a managing director at retail analytics firm GlobalData, said in a new research note. When McMillon early next year, it will mark the end of a transformational era under his watch. “McMillon took over at a moment when Amazon was rising and consumer expectations were shifting, and he leaves the company significantly more digital, data-driven, and global than when he arrived,” said Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president at RiseOpp, a marketing strategies company. “For Walmart, the change in leadership brings both opportunity and risk: The business is stronger, but the playbook must now evolve under a new era of margin pressure and economic uncertainty.” Business experts say McMillon was particularly innovative and visionary in implementing these strategic windfalls for Walmart. McMillon’s “try often, fail fast” mindset abandoned Walmart’s historically risk-averse management posture. “That strategy wasn’t about slogans but about creating enough internal permission to modernize at scale,” said Louisa Loran, a corporate transformational growth specialist and author of the book Leadership Anatomy in Motion. “It’s why automation could be framed as a partnership rather than a threat, and why the digital build-out didn’t fracture Walmart’s culture.” Now Furner will inherit that environment, with an operational foundation designed for accelerated performance, not a reset. “This succession signals that Walmart has crossed an important threshold: moving from the hard lift of transformation into a phase of confident expansion, driving margin expansion,” Loran said. During his tenure, McMillon leveraged that risk-taking management style to form key partnerships with Google’s Waymo, along with Uber and Lyft for product deliveries, among other deals. One of McMillon’s biggest operational shifts was turning Walmart into a hybrid organization, part retailer and part technology platform. “That change improved speed and visibility across the supply chain, but it also blurred the company’s identity and stretched its management structure,” Vahdat said. “Under his leadership, Walmart became much better at connecting digital and physical retail, yet keeping margins steady became more difficult as logistics and technology spending grew.” Walmart is almost unrecognizable from the company McMillon inherited, and that’s a big advantage for Furner. “A decade ago, Walmart was a legacy brick-and-mortar powerhouse with a bad reputation for underpaying workers and being the ultimate cheap discounter, struggling to define its digital strategy,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder at Cowen Partners Executive Search. “Today, it operates much more like a tech-enabled logistics company, akin to Amazon, that happens to have stores attached.” Culturally, McMillon transformed Walmart from a defensive to an innovative company. “The place was depressed, executives were embarrassed to say they worked there, and competitors didn’t see Walmart as a serious strategic threat,” Cole said. “McMillon brought in tech-heavy, younger leadership and made real investments in frontline employees.” Operationally, McMillon made a significant impact across other key C-suite areas. “He built a real e-commerce business, modernized the supply chain into an advanced logistics network, and drove Walmart into higher-margin digital plays, including marketplace, advertising, and services, all wrapped in a true omnichannel model,” Cole said. Furner, who has been the CEO of Walmart U.S., should be a big beneficiary of McMillon's leadership and his innovative vision for the retail giant — and those advantages should kick in right away. “Stepping aside now with a clear internal successor in John Furner and a multi-year advisory role, is succession planning done right,” Cole said. “It gives the next CEO a runway while the company is strong and locks in McMillon’s legacy as the leader who modernized Walmart instead of the one who stayed too long.” For the retail sector, McMillon’s exit underscores that the job description for a big-box CEO has permanently shifted toward technology, data, and supply-chain sophistication. “Going forward,” Cole said, “corporate boards will use this transition as a template.”

Title: The conference, K.M. and the ambassador, Tsipras, the “free dove” and its…consequences, the green eagle from Chios & why the Athens Stock Exchange now feels like August

Hello, today we aspire to be the topic of the day, since the conference organized by “Proto Thema” and travel.gr at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel will host the Prime Minister, the U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle, Hatzidakis, Papastavrou, Hardalias, the president of SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos, as well as dozens of distinguished Greek and foreign entrepreneurs, scientists, and public figures. Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel, Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos. Today there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga, as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday, especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well, I was told that the relationship soured later, when Tsipras was in the opposition, and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break, especially in politics, and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves, not to the… audience, particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras, with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy, should have expected such clashes, bitterness, and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out, there will be much more, possibly much worse. In that sense, I don’t know whether he did the right thing, because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots,” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore, some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him, hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand, the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad, it’s still publicity, and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most. Meanwhile, Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios, named Stavros Michailidis, appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones, and with a 19-seat capacity, at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft, he replied: “I know, I know, because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP, whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related), read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand, Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement, yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that? I hear that today at noon, after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time,” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp, things have always been worked out around a table, but K. M. avoids dinners. The in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm, and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle, who gives especially elegant gifts, brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging, while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica, but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas, about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador. After meeting the Archbishop, the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense, where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast, toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems. The government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency, Maximos Mansion, and Parliament, where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total, from the Press Office, Protocol, and the Ukrainian Embassy, who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time, which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens, then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours, compared with the initial schedule. Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT, the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words, our money—because, shockingly, the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone, including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years, following the bill on the registry of print and online media, order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting, and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things… A longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who, through Nikos Karachalios, “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had, among other things, an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more? On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This, of course, remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon, as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side, where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares, brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients, and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors, it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast, where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders, but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success. If the column had to place a bet, it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g., a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously, a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know), and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI, FTSE, etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed, with the relevant decision coming in two or three months, as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market, and beyond that, our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.” OTE’s CEO, Kostas Nebis, described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber, which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project, with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project, with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT), of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure, and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023, OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones, and with the completion of the above agreements, OTE will assume the entire project, with the concession period (service period), before the infrastructure is transferred to the State, amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts, Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas, as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country, in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market. As for OTE’s results, what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously, something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications, but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market, but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax,” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally, pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case, OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange, with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end. And since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company, let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically, everything started in early autumn, when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules, photography was forbidden, the meetings were confidential, and the event was not widely publicized. At that time, representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia, made the necessary presentations, and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent, and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion, but even more important is the increase in trading volume, while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern. Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight, this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital, his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles, it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region, Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side, particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI, we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation,” he said, implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes, his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives, at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects. The cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close, marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones, facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels, which, however, do not fully cover the needs of islanders, particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time, freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels, which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route, which had been discussed at times, seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link, there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example, when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season. The trading week began with the General Index at 1,986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week, closing at 2,074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer, when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2,000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets, which were drifting in negative territory, with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight, the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2,074.96 points, while today it traded between 2,057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2,083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million, with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session, followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23), Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2), Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2), TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35), and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC, Alpha Bank, Optima Bank, and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks, ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit, as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35). The Greek company Theon, listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100,000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move, Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400,000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026, Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi. With five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register, TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday, the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos, who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing, as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million, zero debt, and first-half profits of €560,000, TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange, with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs. The Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025, after the €1.65-billion agreement in September, while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome, a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI, which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions, Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider. Seventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today, subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October, the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, the largest subprime auto lender, acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns, then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway. Explore related questions

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason! The venture capital playbook is broken. Not bent — broken. In the latest 20VC x SaaStr episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll dissect why even Sequoia is making dramatic leadership changes, why seed investing at $50M pre-money might not work anymore, and what it actually takes to build venture returns in the age of AI. This isn’t your typical venture conversation about “exciting trends.” This is three investors with $3+ billion in combined AUM telling you what’s actually working, what’s spectacularly failing, and why the old playbook from 2015-2022 is now a liability. On Venture Capital Evolution: On AI Investment Strategy: On Deal Dynamics: On Portfolio Construction: On Fundraising Process: On Market Dynamics: When Sequoia replaced Roelof Botha as managing partner after just three years with Pat Grady and Alfred Lin in a split leadership structure, the venture world noticed. But the reaction from our panel was telling: this wasn’t about interpersonal drama or normal succession planning. “Whenever you have a CEO change happening in venture, it’s because something isn’t working,” Rory stated bluntly. “This is dissatisfaction about how the firm is doing relative to the competition. They missed some rounds and some deals. They passed on some great companies.” But rather than viewing this as a Sequoia-specific challenge, the panel sees it as symptomatic of a broader industry issue. “More people should be stepping aside today,” Jason argues. “VCs, executives, founders. Most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” Rory adds context: “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” The meta-lesson? Even the best firms are struggling to keep pace with AI, which means everyone else should be asking themselves hard questions about whether they’re still the right people for this moment. And Sequoia gets credit for one thing: ruthless decisiveness. “They did not do that fatal error of saying it’s someone’s turn so we’ll leave him in,” Rory notes. “They ruthlessly said, if we’re going to compete, we need these people, not those people.” Michael Burry made headlines (again) by shorting Nvidia and Palantir to the tune of $1.1 billion. Unlike most pundits who just discussed whether he’d be right, Jason actually did the math on what it takes to make money on these bets. “It brings home how hard a business it is to bet against AI capex,” Jason concludes. “You not just got to be right, but you got to be right on timing.” Rory’s take: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” The counterpoint to all this short-selling cynicism? The revenue is actually showing up. OpenAI is projected to hit $20B ARR this year, while Anthropic projects $70B ARR by 2028. The growth rates aren’t just holding — they’re accelerating. Harry drives this home: “Are we being overly British? Are we looking for a problem that’s not there? The revenue is showing up in billions.” The lesson: It’s intellectually easy to be a skeptic about AI valuations. It’s financially hard to make money being that skeptic. And meanwhile, the actual revenue keeps proving the bulls right. Few stories capture the AI revenue opportunity better than Gamma’s latest round. The company raised $100M at a $2.1B valuation, having hit $100M in revenue with just 50 people and 2 million users. Harry, Jason, and Rory are such a great combo. One of the top shows every single week. https://t.co/NB29EhA02T — Grant Lee (@thisisgrantlee) November 13, 2025 Jason and Team SaaStr are super-users and he walks through exactly how they use it at SaaStr: “Instead of sending sponsors the same dated prospectus, Gamma automatically pulls all of our data from Salesforce and our marketing automation system. It knows the exact number of leads and ROI. It knows who their competitors are and makes a fully dynamic piece of collateral in about 10 minutes.” Here’s the math that’s important: SaaStr pays $100/month for Gamma — $1,200 per year. That’s stealth TAM expansion. “How much do we spend for Google Slides? Zero. It’s built in. How much do we spend on PowerPoint? I don’t even know where my key is to Microsoft Office. So it is a stealth TAM expansion.” But Jason’s most important insight is about what’s coming next: “The lame thing about co-pilots is they were just tools. When the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk, the amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” He distinguishes between AI as a tool versus AI as a team member: “It is sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. The level of autonomy and capability — Gamma, go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, review once, and distribute to the team.” But there’s a warning embedded in Gamma’s story too. Canva now has a Gamma clone that’s “pretty good.” The competitive response time has collapsed from years to months or even weeks. This leads to one of the episode’s most important debates… This might be the single most important strategic question facing every seed and Series A investor right now. And the panel doesn’t fully agree on the answer. Jason frames the problem: “The quality of clones is only going up. I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader. The ability of AI to enable us to clone better stuff faster — Canva is borderline competitive with Gamma and wasn’t when Cliff was on the show. What does seed investing mean when you might see 10 better versions in 30 days?” Rory’s response: “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale. Once you become the anointed winner, once a market coalesces and there’s two or three people, you know, it’s yours to lose.” But Rory pushes back on the idea that this makes seed investing impossible: “You just have to internalize the game you’re in. Awesome team, run fast, be superlative on technology, get your distribution early, and then rely on that. You can’t be anointed the winner up front. Get over it everybody.” Jason’s concern is economic: “Is that okay at 50 post for a seed round? Do the outcomes justify it? If I’ve got to spread $5 million checks around at 50 post, it’s tougher.” Harry asks the critical question: “Are we getting paid for the risk?” He notes that even at the Series B stage, it’s unclear who will win in many categories. Looking at customer support AI companies that have raised Series B rounds: “I got no idea who the winner is in that category and I don’t think anyone does to be honest.” The debate crystallizes around whether you can know enough at the B to justify the valuation: Rory’s view: By the Series B, you can see rank order. “Once the horses are running and once they round the first furlong, you can actually see the rank order of where they’re running in a way you can’t at the early A.” Harry’s counter: Looking at codegen — even with clear leaders like Cursor emerging, you have Codex making incredible ground, Claude Code advancing, and Replit and Lovable coming from different angles. “I think that’s still entirely up for grabs.” The practical implication: This uncertainty means one of two things: Jason’s conclusion: “Maybe you need 40 deals at $5M. That’s $200M for first checks. $200M for reserves. That’s $400M. $100M for fees and backup. I need at least $500M for my little seed fund to make the math work.” Amid all the complexity, the panel crystalizes a simple framework for what actually works in AI investing right now. DataDog crushed earnings, with stock up 23% and $15M+ in AI-native customers. Why? They’re selling to the people making AI, and as those companies grow, DataDog sells more too. Jason: “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies. They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the Replit story — Jason deployed 20+ AI agents that generate significant revenue while requiring substantial daily management but far less human headcount than traditional approaches. The key distinction: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story. But when it’s real, when the AI agent is sufficiently autonomous to complete material high-value tasks, that’s when you’re actually part of the team, not just a tool.” “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly. I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” But he’s skeptical this is as compelling as the first two: “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” If you’re not doing one of these three things, you’re probably not going to see explosive growth. Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage. One of the most tactically useful segments came when Harry shared a founder interaction that frustrated him: the company said they wanted to “run a process” despite Harry offering terms they’d stated they wanted. Harry’s reaction: “I said, listen, if you’re running a process, you’re either optimizing for price or partner selection. I’m giving you a great price today that you said you wanted, which means you’re not optimizing for price. Which is just saying you think you can get better than me. In which case, just tell me straight.” Rory sees both sides: “From the founder’s side, they’re correct. I see more failed financings because they didn’t run a process than because they did.” But then he makes a critical distinction: “What typically happens when people ‘don’t run a process’ is someone comes in, says they’re interested, and the founder shares information serially to someone not yet ready to commit. That’s a mistake. That’s running an accidental process.” Jason has the most nuanced take on optimal strategy: “The best founders cultivate enough interest with enough good VCs that if they hit the number, they just send an email. Harry, I’m thinking about raising around before the end of the year. And Harry could say, I’ll give you a term sheet today. And the right answer is: ‘I love you, Harry. I’m not ready today. I will be ready at the end of the year.'” The key insight: “The optimal way to run it is for everyone already to want to invest for real without games before you open your data room. The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” Rory synthesizes: “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are. If a founder is smartly nurturing relationships, keeping people broadly informed, then tries to time the interest such that when they’re ready to put their hand up, there’s three people who are primed and ready to go — that is perfection itself.” But here’s the brutal caveat: Jason points out that this only works if you have stellar numbers. “You’re either YC, Neo, South Park Commons, got something, get funded — or who the hell is going to find you? You better be hot AI-native with top-quartile venture growth or you ain’t getting funded.” Harry shares a data point that proves this: A company that grew from $400K to $3M ARR (classic enterprise SaaS, 10x growth) had 120 meetings and got one term sheet at $10M on $40M post. That’s 12x revenue for a 10x grower — which five years ago would have generated five term sheets from top firms. “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason concludes. “You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” While DataDog surged 23%, Duolingo crashed 25% in the same week. The contrast illustrates everything about what’s working and what’s not in AI. Jason’s diagnosis: “Duolingo has the ‘wrong’ kind of AI. Duolingo is using AI to make its product better. Hooray. Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” Rory pushes back slightly on behalf of consumer apps: “If you’re an infrastructure company, you can co-attach to compute. If you’re a new AI apps company, you are using that compute. But if you’re like Duolingo — preexisting — what you can do is co-adopt the technology.” But Jason sees a bigger problem: “Duolingo took money from Berlitz and all these language schools. Hooray, you did that. Now, where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory makes an interesting point about where the AI opportunity in education actually is: LLM learning is equivalent to one-on-one human tutoring. What AI should enable in education is allowing everyone to get one-on-one learning instead of group-based learning. But there’s no budget in K-12 to give every kid a customized tutor. The market is adults wanting to learn a second language for business who would pay for a one-on-one coach — a niche market. Jason’s framework applies here too: “If you’re not removing humans from the equation, you’re going to be heavily discounted. You’re either getting money from compute or you’re getting money because you’re using AI to replace humans. Otherwise, congratulations on your 14% growth.” One exchange revealed how different the panel’s approaches are to portfolio construction — and why both can work. Harry revealed his team’s meeting load: “With my four investing partners, we have 80 net new companies that we meet in person per week.” Jason’s response: “I would resign. I would give you all my carry back. I sold my companies because I didn’t want to spend my life in meetings. I’ll do one a week, two max.” But Jason’s critique cuts deeper than meeting volume: “When you do 200 deals between your team, you got to meet 500, 600, 700 founders a year. I don’t want to meet 500 founders a year. Unless you’re great, you’re going to blow my mind. But if you’re not, I’m gonna start yawning about 15 minutes into this meeting.” Rory defends the high-volume approach: “Even on an okay deal, you learn nuances about a specific market from the one-on-one that you wouldn’t get from the presentation. The person inside living it every day has a crucial kernel of knowledge that you just can’t access any other way.” But the conversation reveals a deeper truth about fund construction: The Small Fund, High Multiple Approach (Hummingbird-style): The Large Fund, Maintained Ownership Approach (Lightspeed-style): Rory’s key insight: “Both are great outcomes. They’re just different ways to play the game. The interesting thing is both outcomes have great outcomes for the GP. But if you only have $1 to play with as an LP, you want the small fund 10x. If you have to deploy $100M, you have to do the big fund. The high small fund accept the follow-on dilution but make a marvelous return is the compelling product for the marginal dollar.” Speaking of Hummingbird, their Billion to One investment deserves its own section because it represents what’s possible when everything goes right. Hummingbird did their first bio deal in Billion to One and now has an $800M position on the IPO — likely representing an 800x+ return on their initial investment from a sub-$100M fund. Harry marvels: “You want freaking great venture returns? Credit due. Amazing.” But Jason asks the tactical question every seed investor should be asking: “How did they collect the capital as a seed manager to deploy enough to maintain the ownership? I don’t see how I’ll ever own 18% of something at IPO ever again.” The answers are telling: Rory makes the crucial point: “You can accept some dilution and optimize for multiple rather than ownership. If you put in $4M and get diluted from 20% to 12% but it’s a $5B exit, you’re a hero.” Jason counters with what’s exciting about capital efficient outcomes: “Navan at $4.5B, Billion to One at $5B — the power of capital efficiency and running lean delivers superior investor returns despite smaller headline valuations.” The lesson: Small funds generating 10x+ returns by accepting dilution but betting on capital-efficient companies may be the optimal strategy for seed investors who don’t have the deployment capacity of mega-funds. Pulling all these threads together reveals several uncomfortable truths: 1. The Middle Class of Fundable Companies is Gone “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason states flatly. The classic SaaS triple-triple-double-double company? A company growing from $400K to $3M ARR would have had five term sheets from good firms. Now: 120 meetings, one term sheet. 2. Most People from the Last Decade Should Step Aside This isn’t ageism — it’s pace of change. “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade,” Jason argues. “I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today. We don’t even need half the VCs we have today for the AI world.” 3. Diversification Matters More, Not Less With increased variance in outcomes and compressed time to clone, the math says diversification is critical. But diversification at seed prices requires massive funds or acceptance of lower ownership. 4. There Are Only Three Ways to Win Attach to compute budgets, replace human headcount, or massively displace incumbents. If you’re not doing one of those three things, you’re probably building a slow-growth SaaS company in a world that doesn’t want those anymore. 5. Capital Efficiency Delivers Superior Returns Billion to One at $5B and Navan at $4.5B generated better investor returns than most $20B+ outcomes because they raised less capital. The lesson: optimize for investor returns, not headline valuations. 6. The Best Fundraises Don’t Feel Like Processes Cultivate relationships over months. Have 3-4 investors ready to commit before you formally raise. Send one email and get multiple term sheets. That’s the optimal path. 7. If You’re Not Excited, You Should Retire Jason’s most important point: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” The panel is clear about what’s coming: “This year was AI works. Next year is AI is part of your team.” That transition — from AI as a tool making you more efficient to AI as an actual member of your team with autonomy, knowledge, and capability — is where the revenue explosion happens. Jason’s final thought captures the optimism underlying all the tough talk: “If you’re not incredibly excited right now, if this isn’t one of the most exciting and stressful times simultaneously, you’re missing it. This is a great enormous mega trend. It’s the biggest mega trend maybe since the early days of the internet. Leaning into it is the only sensible thing to do, and playing against it is dumb as rocks.” The old playbook is broken. The new playbook is being written in real-time. And the investors who figure it out — whether through small concentrated funds like Hummingbird or large diversified portfolios like Harry’s approach — will capture the extraordinary returns available in this moment. Everyone else? Maybe it’s time to buy that beach house. On Venture Evolution: “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” — Jason Lemkin “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” — Rory O’Driscoll On AI Investment Strategy: “Tools are great when the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk. The amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” — Jason Lemkin “Sell to the people who are making AI and if they grow, you’ll sell more too.” — Jason Lemkin On Defensibility: “You just can’t take that early first month explosion as seriously as you used to. It’s not as defensible.” — Harry Stebbings “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Market Timing: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction.

You’re either getting funded or you ain’t seeing it anywhere.” — Jason Lemkin On Taking Action: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. You had a great run.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/14/2025 9:20:13 AM PST by Red Badger Tucker Carlson to announce his findings related to the assassination attempt of President Trump in Butler on Friday night. Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Just saying. I hear you. In Defense of the Trump administration, they have been fighting alligators and snakes while attempting to drain the swamp.... ,to use an old analogy. The Butler investigation was mostly done under the Biden administration. I would like to see more about the attempted assassin, as well. Probably not as high on the priority list. 13 posted on 11/14/2025 9:50:03 AM PST by marktwain [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: Starboard Where is Maxwell Yearick?

The agencies are infested with hard core anti-Trump liberals; lots of internal resistance, if not downright subversion of Trump’s agenda. I realize that draining the swamp is not going to be quick or easy. So yes, that has to be taken into account. Nevertheless, the public deserves to know a lot more, especially in an event of this magnitude. Something is being covered up IMO. 16 posted on 11/14/2025 10:16:48 AM PST by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Tuucker Carlson? No thanks.

We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not.

It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret?

Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 13 to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol GRAY. The firm manages approximately $35 billion across more than 40 crypto products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a public company, Grayscale will have to disclose more financials and face shareholder pressure, which could influence future fee decisions and product strategy. The filing does not specify share count or pricing range for the proposed offering. Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor will serve as lead managing bookrunners. Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. The company posted net income of $203.3 million through September 2025 compared with $223.7 million a year earlier. Operating margin reached 65.7% in the recent nine-month period. The firm’s weighted-average management fee declined to 1.39% through September 2025 from 1.67% in the prior-year period, reflecting competitive pressure from lower-cost ETF entrants, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Average assets under management slipped to $30.6 billion from $31.8 billion year-over-year. Full-year 2024 results showed revenue of $506.2 million and net income of $282.1 million, down from $512.7 million and $325 million, respectively, in 2023. The company attributed the decline to reduced management fees, outflows, and distributions. The offering employs a dual-class share structure, giving Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, 10 votes per Class B share compared with one vote per Class A share. DCG will retain approximately 70% of total voting power after the IPO through its Class B holdings, which carry no economic rights. Each Class A share will receive one vote and full economic participation. The structure qualifies Grayscale as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements. The Class B super-voting rights terminate when DCG’s ownership falls below 20% of total shares outstanding. The IPO does not alter the legal structure, custody arrangements, or operations of Grayscale’s existing trusts and ETFs. Fund assets remain held by third-party custodians under separate trust agreements. The company completed a reorganization into a Delaware holding structure earlier in 2025, which it stated would not materially affect trust operations. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase membership interests from existing owners in Grayscale Operating, rather than funding capital expenditures. The transaction converts private ownership stakes into publicly tradable equity without requiring the injection of new capital into fund operations or altering sponsor fee arrangements. Grayscale reserved a portion of IPO shares for eligible investors in its Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) through a directed share program. Participants must have held GBTC or ETHE shares as of Oct. 28 and complete pre-registration by Nov. 24. The program does not guarantee allocations, and shares purchased through it face no lock-up restrictions. The public listing will subject Grayscale to quarterly and annual reporting requirements, providing ETF investors with increased visibility into the sponsor’s financial condition, litigation exposure, and product concentration. The registration statement indicates that future fee decisions and product expansion plans will face scrutiny from public equity holders alongside existing competitive pressure in the ETF market.

Title: 'His people are worried': Trump raises eyebrows after asking CEOs for affordability tips

She teaches journalism courses for UCLA Extension and previously taught at Loyola Marymount University. She has worked with the Los Angeles Times and Times Community News, Maria Shriver, Vertical Networks, attn:, Patch and City News Service. She is a Southern California native and Loyola University Chicago graduate. President Donald Trump asked top CEOs for their solutions on how to navigate affordability for Americans while apparently forecasting an economic boom in the U.S. that he compared to the Reagan and Clinton eras. The president held a private dinner at the White House on Wednesday with several top CEOs from Wall Street and corporate America, including JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, according to The New York Post. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also there. “He spoke a lot about affordability and what we can do from a market perspective to address it,” one CEO told The Post. Although Trump did not refer to it as an "affordability crisis," he did notion to the CEOs that Americans are struggling and that he's looking for help to improve things. "The CEOs didn’t confront Trump on his prediction, which is far higher than most optimistic forecasts, including the 4% growth outlook from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. But privately, many had doubts given the current economic headwinds," The Post reports. Some CEOs told the outlet that even Trump's own economic advisers are skeptical that this growth could happen, voicing their concerns over the 2026 midterm elections after the Democratic governor victories in New Jersey, Virginia and Zohran Mamdani's mayoral election in New York City. “I sure hope the president is right about 6% growth,” another CEO said in an interview with The Post. “But I don’t see how we get there. His people are worried as well particularly about affordability but they won’t tell him. He’s surrounded by a lot of ‘yes men.'” Some of the CEOs suggested opening up the markets for people to put their retirement savings in the stock market. Based on what's happened in the past, this could yield high returns for investors compared to other assets. “Trump is really interested in making sure we have an economy of owners, not renters with all their money in the bank,” another CEO who declined to be named told The Post.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces new layoffs, and it's worrying for the next Tomb Raider game

Crystal Dynamics doesn’t seem to be in a good shape. Indeed, yesterday, the studio announced the layoff of just under 30 people on LinkedIn, which is worrying for the upcoming Tomb Raider game. While Tomb Raider fans eagerly await new information about the next title in this franchise, Crystal Dynamics unveiled a rather worrying statement yesterday on LinkedIn: "Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.” And that's not all, because Crystal Dynamics claimed that these layoffs are essential for the future of the studio as well as for optimizing the development of the next Tomb Raider game. However, this situation may seem alarming to some. Indeed, there have already been layoffs in August at the company, and in October, some further dismissals at Amazon. Thus, it is difficult to imagine that this new game will not be affected by these decisions made by Crystal Dynamics. But it is also possible that its production goes well, and that it could be unveiled before the end of 2025. As a reminder, all we know is that it will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used. Some rumors mention an open world, which could offer many possibilities to the players.

Title: 'Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe'

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Even six years on from leaving, Joe Schmidt remains intrinsically linked with Irish rugby. It's not just in the professional game that the former Leinster and Ireland coach is keeping his ear to the ground. Like many visiting teams to Dublin, the Wallabies had booked Wanderers RFC on Merrion Road for their training base this week, but when a deluge of rain fell on the city on Wednesday night, a late call was made - at 10.47pm to be exact, according to Schmidt – to try find a new venue. A few calls were made, and the Wallabies were soon able to hold their Thursday morning training session at Blackrock College. "As a Terenure man, that was a really big favour," Schmidt joked. The New Zealander was in wonderful form on Thursday after naming his side for this evening’s Quilter Nations Series meeting with Ireland. Enthusiasm at a press conference can often be painted on, but there was no doubting Schmidt's sincerity as he spoke ahead of what could be his final time coaching a team at the Aviva Stadium. The one downside, he claimed, was that even the late kick-off at the Aviva wouldn't be late enough to allow him get down to Lakelands and watch his adopted club, Terenure, take on their Dublin 6 neighbours St Mary’s College in the All-Ireland League this afternoon. "I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes..." - Tadhg Furlong and James Ryan on Joe Schmidt's lasting legacy in Irish Rugby 🏉 Watch #IREvAUS live on @RTE2 and @RTEplayer this Saturday. ☘️🦘 pic.twitter.com/30mE6RcYB6 Nure got multiple mentions from Schmidt when he spoke to the media on Thursday. They were his local club when he lived in Dublin, while he was a patron for the Terenure Tigers, the club’s team for those with special needs. His son, Tim, played to AIL level with the club, and as coincidence would have it, they are now coached by another famous Kiwi, Carlos Spencer, who Schmidt coached during their time together at the Auckland Blues. With every year that he’s been out of Ireland, his relationship with the country appears to have grown stronger. In his nine years coaching Leinster and Ireland, silverware became the norm. In three seasons as Leinster head coach, he guided the province to two Champions Cup titles, one URC (then Pro12) and a Challenge Cup, before delivering three Six Nations titles, one of which was a Grand Slam, in six years coaching Ireland. That trophy haul made the breakup all the more painful, as Ireland limped out of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Schmidt’s final season, an ending that threatened to damage his hard-earned legacy. But as usual, time has healed many of those wounds. "He's a hell of a coach," Tadhg Furlong told RTÉ Sport this week. "I think Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe and what he did, for not only the team when he was in charge, but some of the systems he put in place, working alongside David Nucifora obviously." Furlong is one of many in this Irish squad for whom Schmidt had a profound impact. Of the matchday squad for this Saturday, eight were given Ireland debuts by Schmidt during his time in charge, while four others in the wider squad came through under the New Zealander. His influence is arguably even stronger in the coaching team. Schmidt brought Andy Farrell in as his assistant in 2016 after he had been let go by England, and his career has gone from strength to strength. Paul O’Connell and Johnny Sexton were two of Schmidt’s key players during his time in charge of Ireland, while Simon Easterby was his long time forwards coach. John Fogarty and Andrew Goodman also both briefly played under him at Leinster. "I grew up in international rugby under Joe and I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes and some of the phrases and sayings, ingrained in us as a team, you're still kind of thinking that way," Furlong added. "Even though he's gone, and he's gone a long time, he still has a lasting effect on not only Irish rugby as a whole, but I think with certain players in the group that have been coached by him still." James Ryan is another of the current Irish frontliners who was given his start under Schmidt, making his Ireland debut against the USA in the summer of 2017 before he had even represented Leinster. "I hadn't played any rugby and I went on that Irish tour. It was my first taste of what it was like at the highest level," Ryan said. "I'd say at that age, I was 20, I just took a huge amount from him. You understand what a proper, committed preparation looks like. "I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said about him before, but the level of prep, the level of detail and understanding of what you need to get across to be ready for the weekend. It was huge and it's definitely something that I learned at that age." When he left the Ireland job in 2019, he initially said he would be retiring from coaching, and spent some time consulting with World Rugby, before he was tempted to help out with the All Blacks as a selector, and when a Covid-19 outbreak derailed the New Zealand squad during their Test series with Ireland in 2022, it was Schmidt who was brought in to lead the team on the week of the first Test. The All Blacks hammered Ireland in that first Test, although Farrell’s side would go on to win the series, before Schmidt got his revenge a year later when he was part of the New Zealand coaching team that once again knocked Ireland out of the World Cup. He got back into head coaching in 2024 when he took on the Wallabies job, a task described this week by the Sydney Morning Herald's Jonathan Drennan as a "bin-fire" after their disastrous World Cup showing the previous year. "Joe said he was going to take a step back from rugby when he left [Ireland] and I wish he did because you just keep coming up against Joe Schmidt," Furlong laughs, as he looked forward to meeting his old coach once again. This will be his second – and last – trip to Dublin as Australia head coach, and considering the green tint on this year’s British and Irish Lions, Schmidt should be plenty familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this Irish side. "I think Joe understands the Irish system pretty well," Ryan says. "He understands us pretty well and I get the sense that he loves coming over here with Australia and trying to take us on. "We've had some big games against them over the years and I know that will be no different this weekend. Both of those went right down to the wire in the last couple of years."

Title: BlackRock’s BUILD launches on BNB Chain as RWA momentum accelerates

BNB Chain has welcomed a new resident today as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUILD) went live on the platform. The strategic launch, powered by Securitize’s compliant tokenization platform and Wormhole, adds one of the most regulated digital assets to Binance’s thriving financial ecosystem. The strategic move comes as real-world assets see massive traction, with their value up 6% the past month to surpass $36 billion. BUILD’s debut reflects the convergence between blockchain and traditional finance. BlackRock is a leading asset manager and is now bringing its trust, base, and compliance to BNB Chain, a platform known for accessibility, low fees, and high speed. Commenting on today’s arrival, BNB Chain Head of Business Development Sarah Song said: BNB Chain is designed for scalable, low-cost, and secure financial applications, and we’re excited to welcome BUILD to our ecosystem. BUILD is turning real-world assets into programmable financial instruments, enabling entirely new types of investment strategies on-chain. Meanwhile, the development introduces a new share class on Binance’s ecosystem, offering eligible investors access to a tokenized US dollar yield in a blockchain setup. BlackRock’s tokenized asset also secures new utility. Binance will now accept BUILD as collateral. That allows professional traders and institutions to deploy cash smoothly without surrendering exposure to Treasuries-linked RWAs. That use case underscores the broader shift in how on-chain systems integrate real-world assets. These products are maturing from static representations to practical instruments that can function across DeFi and TradFi environments. Securitize, a regulated tokenization firm boasting more than $4 billion in tokenized AUM (assets under management), is powering BlackRock’s expansion into BNB Chain. Securitize handles everything from fund administration to digital transaction agency services. That ensures that clients access enterprise-level RWAs within regulated frameworks. At the same time, BUILD unlocks new use cases that were previously absent for real-world tokenized assets. According to Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo: Expanding BUILD to the BNB Chain and making it available as collateral on the Binance exchange further extends its accessibility and reinforces our mission to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach. BUILD’s launch on BNB Chain comes as on-chain real-world assets see impressive growth. RWAxyz data shows the value of RWAs on public blockchains increased by 5.91% the past 30 days to $36.06 billion. Furthermore, the number of holders surged 10.78% to 537,549, with asset issuers hitting 249. Such figures reflect a flourishing ecosystem of enterprises tokenizing regulated real-world assets.

Title: THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance

THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance The cost of auto insurance, for those of us who actually keep our vehicles insured, has increased dramatically in the past few years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (as reported by US News), the cost of car insurance increased by 56% from 2020 to 2025. There are obviously many inputs into the increased cost of insurance, including the obvious one - an increase in the cost of repairs, because vehicles are more expensive and more complicated than ever before. Most news stories will also lazily throw in tariffs or supply chain problems as contributing reasons. But there is another worsening problem that is a major cause of rising auto insurance premiums, and that is uninsured drivers. Coincidentally, the surge in uninsured drivers over recent years neatly coincides with President Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas throwing the border open wide to millions of illegal aliens. Per the Insurance Research Council’s most recent full year data (2023), there has been a huge increase in the number of uninsured drivers. In 2019, 11.6% of drivers lacked automobile liability insurance, but just four years later in 2023 that number had increased to 15.4% of drivers. Another way to state this is that in 2019, one in nine drivers were uninsured, but in 2023 that number had deteriorated to one in six. This data is sourced from insurance claims where an insured driver had to use his Uninsured Motorist Coverage to make a claim, because the party at fault in the wreck did not have insurance. But this also means that wrecks between two uninsured motorists go unnoticed by the Insurance Research Council (“IRC”, as do single car wrecks involving uninsured motorists, since they obviously cannot make an insurance claim. It can be extrapolated then that the percent of uninsured drivers is even higher. Compounding the problem is the growing number of drivers who are underinsured, meaning they have liability insurance at the minimum amount required to register a vehicle and/or obtain a drivers license, but the amount of insurance is woefully insufficient. For instance, Texas’ minimum requirement for liability insurance covers just $25,000 of physical damage per accident, which is less than the replacement cost of most cars on the road, and much less than the average cost of most new cars. In California, the amount is just $15,000. Per the IRC, in the same four-year span of 2019, the number of underinsured motorists increased from 12.2% of drivers to 18.0%. In summary, here is the expensive truth: • More than 33% of accidents involve drivers who are either uninsured or underinsured, meaning they do not have sufficient insurance to pay for the damage they caused. This is up from 23% in just four years. • Therefore, one in three wrecks require the party not at fault to file a claim against his own insurance company, using his “Uninsured Motorist Coverage.” • This also means that those of us obeying the law and properly maintaining our insurance are subsidizing uninsured and underinsured drivers. I have insinuated that the rise in uninsured motorists corresponds closely with the Biden-era influx of illegal aliens. While correlation alone does not prove causation, there is data indicating that the influx of non-citizen drivers has been a major contributor to the rise in uninsured motorists. In a post of mine from September titled “Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc” I documented that Tricolor was a company that sold and financed used cars, and its primary market was Spanish-speaking illegal aliens. It was the 7th largest used car dealer in the country, with a huge market presence in California and Texas. Tricolor went spectacularly bankrupt when President Trump’s crackdown on illegal aliens brought sales to a standstill and widespread defaults on loan repayment. What I didn’t document was Tricolor’s role in putting drivers on the road who weren’t properly insured. The simple truth is that a critical aspect of selling used cars to high-risk drivers is that liability insurance must be obtained to get a vehicle registered, so there is an industry that provides 30-day liability insurance policies to these high-risk drivers. Once the vehicle is registered, it is extremely common for the insurance to lapse after 30 days. The actuarial risk these companies are taking is that the high-risk driver can make it one whole month without causing a wreck before the insurance lapses. Since Tricolor needed its customers insured, albeit briefly, it established its own insurance agency which worked exclusively with “nonstandard” insurance carriers to provide the 30-day policies necessary to sell a car. Per an article from 2019 in Auto Remarketing magazine, “Tricolor Insurance Agency, an affiliate of Tricolor Auto Group, currently serves as an agent for 10 nonstandard carriers and markets its services throughout Tricolor’s 28 dealerships and through its eight Ganas dealerships in southern California.” This article estimated that even in 2019, nonstandard insurance comprised about 30% of the personal auto insurance market. Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. As bad as this all sounds, it gets even worse. Ace of Spades reader “Sabrecav” educated me on just how unsavory the nonstandard insurance racket is. Although their market is customers who are otherwise uninsurable, if a customer with a nonstandard insurance policy gets into a wreck before his policy lapses, the nonstandard insurers are very aggressive about refusing to pay claims. Sabrecav provided me a link to this story as an example: “Crash victims say 'non-standard' auto insurance companies are not fairly compensating them” [ABC7Chicago – 02/18/2025] Drivers must have insurance in Illinois, and non-standard insurance legally covers those who are a high risk or have a bad credit history. But some people who were hit by drivers with non-standard insurance say they are getting lowballed on claims. Debra Smith has been battling the Chicago-based driver's insurance company American Alliance Casualty. It is a non-standard auto insurer. She says the process was slow and she was offered much less than she thought she would get. "They're saying $1,000. That won't be - that's not even the amount of money to get to replace the stuff," Smith said. An estimate from her body shop said repairs could be $5,320. And American Alliance Casualty is saying that it will only cover $805 dollars of its own $1,000 estimate because its only accepting 75% of liability. The Biden-era open-border policy has been costly and destructive to this country in so many ways. One of those is the cost being borne by those of us who maintain auto insurance, because we are paying for the increase in wrecks caused by uninsured illegal aliens.

Supply chain is indeed a real problem and cause. Especially for newer foreign cars, getting replacement parts is hard if not impossible unless you pay inflated prices. Exotics? Fuhgeddaboudit. So the costs of repairs is much higher than they should be. In some cases, the cost would be so high that the insurance company just totals the car and sells off the good parts. Happened to me a few years ago. The car was repairable, but it would have cost so much that the carrier just cut me a big check.

Posted by: Zombie Robbo the Llama Butcher at November 14, 2025 11:13 AM (LxER7) 28 I would add there are many other factors influencing higher insurance costs: 1. Biden inflation. Everything costs more now. Insurance too. 2. Vast number of utterly terrible drivers on the road. Many are immigrants (legal and illegal) from scumbag cultures who drive like drunken retards. But an awful lot of Americans are terrible too, and some older people no longer have adequate faculties and shouldn't be driving. 3. Huge explosion of delivery drivers, delivery trucks, delivery carts, mopeds, e-bikes, etc. Especially in big cities, there are simply more things on the road to hit.

Part of the problem could be the cost of cars these days. It was either here or Instapundit that someone recently posted as article stating that the average cost of a new one is now somewhere near $50,000. All the technology and modern safety features make cars a lot more expensive than they otherwise have to be. Wouldn't that make the number of underinsured rise (as carrying the amount of insurance needed to cover these pricier cars pushes up the amount of insurance needed and an increasing share of motorists find it difficult to afford the pricier coverage)?

A beautiful fall day. Its 9am and I was driving safely. Car crosses center line and barrels toward me. Do something, anything, or it's high speed head on! I swerve left and cram the brakes as the car veers to my right. CRASH! Got hit on the right hand side of the front end. If there had been anyone in the front passenger seat, they most likely would have died. My injuries were mostly minor except for the crushed heel. Driver was Mexican, legal but stoned. His passengers were illegal, one dead at the scene and the other got a helicopter ride to Indianapolis. They dropped a LifeFlight chopper on the highway about 5 feet from the perimeter of a secure military base! They had to stop in Bloomington to stabilize the guy before going on to Indy. And as soon as he recovered from his amputation, he skedaddled back to Mexico. Driver was underinsured. Took forever to get any money from that shit. My health insurance and car insurance covered most of my medical bills (surgery and4 months recoup). We never really broke even with what little his insurance paid.

Posted by: Martini Farmer at November 14, 2025 11:18 AM (NwnyJ) 47 As a former state insurance regulator responsible for the financial analysis of property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in a major southern state 'uninsured motorist' coverage is nothing more than a profit maker for your insurance company. Irrespective of the insurance status of someone who damages your car, your insurance company is 100% on the hook for the damage repair of your car per whatever your policy stipulations are. Paying in advance for uninsured motorists is just giving your company margin. Posted by: allmenroder at November 14, 2025 11:19 AM (nUBV4) 48 it's short-sighted that the author implicitly claims that only "nonstandard insurance providers" are "aggressive about refusing to pay claims." some of the largest carriers in the country have been long known for their refusal to pay out when their insured are clearly at fault, and there are no legal avenues outside of woefully inadequate arbitration services for any restitution. several months ago, my brother's car was totaled by a woman running a red light on the feeder. he had been at his own red light and proceeded into the intersection when it turned green; the woman hit him as he was entering the intersection. despite a witness statement and a police report suggesting that their insured's "failure to obey traffic signal" was the sole cause of the accident, the company refused to pay out the claim because their insured was adamant that she had a green light and there was no video evidence to contradict her. that company was Allstate. it is doubtless that the biden-era influx of illegals has exacerbated the problem, but it's far from the root of the issue...we've just turned into a nation of irresponsible liars all looking out for Number One.

So a relatively minor accident that deploys airbags ends up totalling the car because the cost of replacing the airbags alone (which means the trim the bags exploded through also needs to be replaced) is sometimes 10s of thousands of dollars.

Even in our rural Northern AZ County, the local sheriff and city police departments are still significantly under-staffed -- as who in their right mind would want to go into law enforcement when your Chief and/or DA and/or AG will throw you under the bus, and you might end up in prison for daring to do your job as trained a la Derek Chauvin (and risk being murdered once there to boot)?

Posted by: DavesNotHere at November 14, 2025 11:21 AM (bUIiy) I recently had dealings with a body shop after hitting a dear with my Silverado. The body shop was a well known long established shop which I have used previously with great satisfaction. Now I wouldn't let them work on a matchbox car. They don't do rust repair. Nobody working there knows how, supposedly. Long lead times for parts. The parts they ordered (Fender, headlight, etc.) wouldn't fit and had to re-order. Then, the body shop tech damaged the truck while driving it into a service bay.

It was either here or Instapundit that someone recently posted as article stating that the average cost of a new one is now somewhere near $50,000. All the technology and modern safety features make cars a lot more expensive than they otherwise have to be. Wouldn't that make the number of underinsured rise (as carrying the amount of insurance needed to cover these pricier cars pushes up the amount of insurance needed and an increasing share of motorists find it difficult to afford the pricier coverage)?

Posted by: Commissar of plenty and festive little hats at November 14, 2025 11:33 AM (mOYn9) 85 Buck, that was a great article. I read it all. Thank you. I don't think I fully appreciate how much effort goes into some of these posts around here. The pro-government people would probably suggest the solution is to have a years worth of insurance, maybe even raising the minimum amounts. As we saw during the shutdown though, a significant number of people can't afford food. The insurance companies would probably set people up for a year policy with monthly payments. People would pay for the first month, register the vehicle and then let insurance coverage lapse. I have no idea what the solution could be aside from requiring people to have a years worth of insurance paid before the vehicle could be registered. And that won't happen. Since I like to share food prices to let the Horde know what things are like here in Canada, I have a 10 year old Honda with about 80,000 MILES - I did the conversion - and pay about $1300 a year for good coverage.

Posted by: Posted by: Stateless - VERY GRATEFUL, BLESSED, LOVED AND HAPPY! -- - New Life Creation - 18.1% at November 14, 2025 11:33 AM (Sco7b) 86 I bought a used car from a private party during the Covid PsyOp in 2020. As I was driving that car home (at dusk) -- after having owned it for no more than 10 minutes, a large deer running across the divided highway (median covered in trees and shrubbery so I didn't see it coming with my usually excellent peripheral vision) crashed into the left front fender. First time I'd ever hit any animal driving, let alone a deer. The front left tire sounded like it was shredding, so stopped and got out the crowbar to pull the crushed fender back off the tire. Anywho, the highly-rated local body shop was so busy they couldn't get me in until over a month later -- and I was able to drive the vehicle with no issues. After they "repaired" it -- it looked brand new -- as I started to drive it out of their lot, it began shaking violently! I took it back and said "What the hell did you do to my car?" and described the issue. They said it was like that when I brought it in -- total bullshit. They said the last thing they did was take it to Big O Tires down the road for an alignment; well, I was good and proper fucked as they'd cracked a head gasket somehow ... so I had to eat that one.

No matter how many accidents or tickets you get, it seems like insurers have to cover you. I know some reckless idiots who had so many points on their license that the state eventually suspended the license. But they had insurance coverage at that time, and again when the suspension period ended. One quite memorable incident involved a guy with a license that was recently unsuspended who drove an exotic car off a bridge. No way this guy should have been driving at all, let alone a $300k car (which was totaled, of course).

In the accident that was my kid's fault, the insurance company lowballed me greatly and I had to fight for an extra $1K (but they still wouldn't fix). In the other, not my kid's fault, insurance gave $3-4K over worth so it didn;t have to fix. Apparently, tariffs and supply chain are making car fixes very expensive and car parts very valuable.

Body shops will grossly overestimate the damages to a car in order to declare it a total loss, because their profit margin on a total loss is about 95% for the storage fees, gate fees, cleanup fees, teardown fees, admin fees, estimating fees, etc. The gross profit on a repairable car is maybe 20-25%.

Posted by: one hour sober at November 14, 2025 11:49 AM (Y1sOo) 133 The concept of "underinsurance" shouldn't be possible, nor should I have to care whether insurance is involved at *all* following an accident. It just shouldn't matter, and if we did insurance differently, it wouldn't. The whole reason for "underinsurance" comes down to three things: 1. Cars are expensive 2. Medical care is ruinously expensive 3. I'm in the hook for 1 and 2. But *why* am I on the hook for it? I shouldn't be, and neither should you. I shouldn't have to carry enough insurance to pay for a Mercedes S-Class and six months of hospitalization. I should pay for *me* and vice-versa. Recast driving as an activity generally to be an assumed-risk activity. Barring recklessness (which is its own category, and for which insurance needn't pay anyway), put *all* liability on the motorist and restrict it to *him* and his passengers. If there's a wreck, even through carelessness or negligence, your fault or not, your insurance pays for your property and care, his pays for his. Or you don't have it. No skin off my back. In the event of recklessness or another voiding issue, the insurance company is welcome to go after you for liability (or I am, if I self-insure).

Mine paid out a claim to someone injured in a rollover (the driver of that vehicle was... you guessed it, uninsured) they claimed I caused (the citation against me was thrown out in court). They didn't think I had any real culpability, but it was easier to simply pay the claim than it was to dispute it. The other reasons are, as you say, Buck, the expense of cars (some of it because of just how expensive they have become, but the other part is low-impact bumpers and such, that used to be handled by putting just a new bumper on - now handled by replacing a huge portion of the rear end, it seems) and the un- and underinsured motorists. As far as expense, vast numbers of cars are simply totalled after an accident, now. Posted by: GWB at November 14, 2025 11:52 AM (9tT1a) 145 Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. ++++ Which also doesn't matter. You can't get blood from a stone. So he's "underinsured?" You have no recourse. Sure, you can sue him (or your insurance company can), but what will you get for it? Bupkiss. The only time "underinsurance" presents an actual risk is if you *do* have assets worth defending. If you don't, then insurance doesn't matter at all except for ticking the box to avoid getting arrested. Have adequate insurance? Why bother? It costs more and buys you nothing.

Both of the following are true: 1. Labor is expensive 2. Capital is cheap, especially if you're deep-pocketed corporation who can borrow at hilariously low rates If you artificially make labor expensive, it creates a capital preference for business spending. Insofar as a business *can* shift the ratio to favor capital expenditure, it will. If you artificially make capital cheap (we do), it *also* creates that same capital preference. Boosting the price of labor while capital is cheap just ensures less labor will be used. This is also why capital cost repression (low rates) acts the same as a higher minimum wage... Posted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at November 14, 2025 11:58 AM (6bTRc) 163 In Texas, you are required to purchase auto insurance. That government mandate creates an artificial scarcity, which drives up insurance rates. The thing that gets me, though, is that they still sell uninsured motorist policies, which you need because the high cost encourages people to get around the mandate. As a bonus, the state's attempt to enforce the mandate leads to lots of opportunities for "big brother" to step in, which of course he does. I guess you could say that I'm not a fan.

The body shop was a well known long established shop which I have used previously with great satisfaction. Now I wouldn't let them work on a matchbox car. They don't do rust repair. Nobody working there knows how, supposedly. Long lead times for parts. The parts they ordered (Fender, headlight, etc.) wouldn't fit and had to re-order. Then, the body shop tech damaged the truck while driving it into a service bay. ++++ I believe it. There is a huge labor shortage in auto body repair these days. The old timers who actually know how to repair things are retiring (or their bodies are giving out), and kids aren't getting into vocational programs to learn body repair. If you're a competent, qualified auto body technician, you can write your own paychecks, there's such a shortage of labor out there.

I always encourage everyone to check how much Underinsurance Coverage they have--and it is rarely enough. I don't do personal injury law but I did have a few such cases when I was a baby lawyer. In one such, my client was partially disabled by the other driver. She was able to recover all of her and her husband's underinsurance, but it was woefully inadequate. Had they had four times and much, she'd have gotten all of it.

It sounds unbelievable but you won’t forgive yourself if you don't check it out. Learn more about it here... https://r0ad2v0te77.blogspot.com/ Posted by: Obie Vandervort at November 14, 2025 03:02 PM (g65ML) 195 Louisiana (New Orleans has the highest car insurance in U.S.; N.J. most expensive *state*) has long had an "uninsured motorist pool" that I've paid in every year. Why can't I take a year or two in that pool? Last year, my daughter was smashed by a car making an illegal turn - grace of God she wasn't hurt; car totaled. Other driver did not speak English and did not have insurance. No arrest, nothing. So although she was 100 percent faultless, prices will go up because *my* insurance company had to pay big.

The Miami-based Securitize, which is planning a public offering, said that BUIDL will be accepted as collateral for trades at the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, describing the asset backed by U.S. Treasuries as a tool for institutional traders. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted last March, and the tokenized money market fund has expanded to eight blockchains since, now including the Binance-backed network that dates back to 2019. “We’re continuing to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach,” co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has around 93 holders, offers a yield. Over the past week, that has averaged 3.7% on an annualized basis, according to crypto data provider RWA.XYZ. Binance’s institutional clients have been asking the exchange for more interest-bearing assets that maintain a stable price, Catherine Chen, head of VIP and institutional at Binance, said in a statement. Chen added that BUIDL was integrated into Ceffu, a Binance-owned custody service, which drew U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny in 2023 over its ability to potentially control assets that belonged to Binance’s U.S. affiliate. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering in 202, was pardoned by President Trump in October. The move has drawn pushback among crypto U.S. Democratic lawmakers. Still, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents the latest sign of how Wall Street firms are embracing the exchange’s services and products. This year, retail brokerage Robinhood, as well as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, have listed BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The coin changed hands around $924 on Friday, representing a 3.4% fall over the past day. The asset hit an all-time high of $1,370 last month, while rising 48% over the past year, but has fallen in recent weeks alongside Bitcoin and most of the market.

Title: Nvidia Reports Earnings Next Week. How Big of a Blowout Will It Be?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Monster Ztudio / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, powering data centers and enabling breakthroughs in generative AI. Over the past few years, the company has transformed from a graphics specialist into a tech powerhouse, with its stock surging amid the AI boom. Over the past five years, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates 90% of the time, sometimes by more than 30%, showcasing consistent outperformance. In the last four quarters, however, the chipmaker has averaged a beat of only 6.5%, likely due to analysts getting better at predicting its results. Investors are now laser-focused on Nvidia’s upcoming third-quarter results, set for release after market close on Nov. 19. Expectations run high, with Wall Street forecasting $54.83 billion in revenue and $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share — up 56% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. This pressure mounts as “whisper numbers,” the unofficial higher estimates circulating among traders, suggest Nvidia must deliver an even bigger surprise to avoid disappointing the market. Any miss could trigger a selloff, especially given its role as a bellwether for the broader AI sector. Nvidia’s success in the recent quarter likely stems from its commanding position in the AI ecosystem. As the primary supplier of GPUs for training large language models, the company has capitalized on demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the prior quarter, data center revenue hit record levels, driven by Blackwell chip ramp-ups and partnerships with AI innovators. These factors could push Q3 revenue toward or beyond the guided $54 billion, with analysts projecting 54% growth. On the bottom line, improved margins from economies of scale and software integrations, such as CUDA, may boost adjusted earnings to around $1.25 per share. Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for simulations has gained traction in industries like automotive and robotics, adding diversified revenue streams. Recent wins include expanded deals with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for cloud AI infrastructure, potentially contributing millions in incremental sales. Overall, these tailwinds position Nvidia for another strong showing, reinforcing its market cap lead on the S&P 500. Despite the momentum, setbacks could temper results. Nvidia faces ongoing restrictions on its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China. This “hangover” persists, with no H20 chip revenue in Q3, as CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed, and no expectation for that to change. While the company still sells less advanced tech, such as gaming and automotive chips, to Chinese customers, the loss of high-margin data center business — previously a key growth driver — may cap upside. Analysts estimate this could shave several billion off potential revenue. Additionally, hedge fund manager Michael Burry’s bearish put options on Nvidia, revealed last week, sparked a 7.2% stock drop, signaling concerns over AI hype and valuation risks (Burry just announced he was closing his Scion fund and returning investor funds because he no longer understood AI market valuations). Broader market dynamics, including competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a coming cash crunch, add uncertainty. If demand softens or supply chain issues arise, these could pressure margins and lead to a guidance miss for Q4, where Wall Street expects $61.33 billion in revenue. Nvidia’s earnings next week could indeed be a blowout, given its 90.5% beat rate over the last 21 quarters and robust AI demand. However, smaller recent beats and China restrictions raise the chance of a negative surprise if results fall short of whisper numbers or its guidance disappoints. In the last three earnings announcements in February, May, and August, Nvidia’s stock has briefly declined twice afterward, underscoring potential post-report volatility. Long-term investors might buy before results if they are confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals — which otherwise seem solid — but risk-averse ones might wait for clarity on guidance. The chipmaker’s stock is down 12% from its all-time hit above $212 at the end of October, and its shares have fallen in the past few sessions. CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) just shocked the market with news of a data center partner’s buildout delay and we may see other AI stocks run into similar situations as the race for scarce resources heats up. The prudent choice just might be to take a wait-and-see approach before diving in.

Title: "Our Democracy" (I'm Sure)

Full Content:
By now, whenever you hear anyone invoke the phrase “saving our democracy,” that should be a signal that they are intent on destroying this republic, and with that, your natural rights to free speech, economic liberty, and public order. What began in 2016 as a simple, high-level plot to take out Donald Trump and squash Trumpism — a grassroots revolt against those very high-level DC insiders —turned sharply in 2017 into a long-running cover-up operation that spawned a multiplying cycle of seditions, treasons, and betrayals of the public — as the insiders desperately tried to evade culpability for each previous act — and finally blossomed into a rolling coup with crypto-Jacobin overtones as the insiders’ useful idiots were recruited to run with the ball of color revolution. For those who can’t quite wrap their minds around this game, a color revolution is the surreptitious overthrow of an elected government by concealed parties. Neocons in the US State Department developed the practice of color revolution on many countries over the years. Mr. Obama added a layer of gnostic Marxists to the personnel mix at State, and these wannabe revolutionaries built a fantastic matrix of NGOs outside State to marshal the useful idiots with jobs and salaries. The NGOs, in turn, were connected to international moneybags, with strange agendas of their own such as the megalomanic climate change crusader Bill Gates and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which funds anarchist district attorneys, the defense of election fraud, mass illegal migration, internet censorship, and money-flows into Antifa, the Left’s street fighters. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com The motives of these players might appear murky, but at this point they can be boiled down to 1) staying out of jail, and 2) retaining control of their empires. Hillary Clinton, for instance, surely wants to stay out of jail for her RussiaGate caper, and retain the ill-gotten lucre of the Clinton Foundation she lives off. At 95, George Soros himself is probably beyond caring about all this, but his son Alex, 38, carries on, and recently cemented his alliance with the Clinton Foundation by marrying the former Mrs. Anthony Wiener, Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s long-time wing-gal. The Democratic Party plays an increasingly curious part in this rolling coup as all its efforts look evermore insane and self-extinguishing — the bootless government shutdown being the latest exercise. The party can no longer meaningfully represent organized labor — since labor moved to faraway lands — so it attempted to replace that earnest bond with fronting for women and minorities. This has resulted in two problems. 1) women taking over the actual machinery of the party has transformed mere politics into never-ending psychodrama and boosted the amplitude of political dirty-fighting to dangerous new levels; and 2) cultivating minority groups has led to an orgy of race-and-gender hustles that amount to gigantic racketeering operations (i.e., making money dishonestly). All of that sound, fury, and roguery is now dedicated only to staving off the party’s collapse and thwarting Mr. Trump’s attempt to restore something like regular order in public affairs, which the Democratic Party calls “authoritarianism.” Regular order is something that healthy male psychology takes an interest in, since it entails defense of the culture, in this case, Western Civ and its heritage. That implies the uses of strength as opposed to the stratagems of weakness. It must acknowledge and rely on classic virtues such as fortitude, prudence, and a preference for what is — as opposed to wishes and fantasies. Psychodrama dispenses with all that for the sake of emotional gratification, often mis-characterized as empathy or caring. It can transform easily into sadism — as you can see now with the calls for violence and murder against Trump-adjacent persons. Meanwhile, be aware that the cries for “saving our democracy” come from the people opposed to regular order in elections, that is, voter ID, voting on election day only, with results reported out at day’s end, paper ballots and no electronic counting machines, and no mail-in ballots (except for people out of the country on election day). All of these stipulations are observed in other nations of Western Civ, and beyond, even in lands where people go about half-clothed. The current psychodrama, of course, is the latest installment of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The Democrats are flogging it with Wile E. Coyote zeal. I suspect it is an Acme booby trap for the ages and it is being carefully laid by Mr. Trump, the Roadrunner, to blow up un the Dems’ faces when all the documents are finally sorted out. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the real-world problems that the US faces, such as runaway financialization of the economy, a broken medical system, mass job layoffs, the collapse of education, surging mental illness, the drug plague, and the sinking middle-class. We’re entering a new phase in the ongoing color revolution, the coup against America, and it’s liable to be the final phase in which all the mystery gets wrung out, the motives are revealed, and the players are correctly sorted and labeled according to their deeds. No new psychodrama will avail to stop what’s coming. I’ll be doing two book events Saturday, Nov 15 in New York’s Capital District to talk up my new novel, Look, I’m Gone.

Title: BlackRock’s $2.5 billion tokenized money market fund gets boost with Binance tie-up
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/14/blackrocks-2-5-billion-tokenized-money-market-fund-gets-boost-with-binance-tie-up/

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Institutional trading of digital assets is already big business. Now, it’s set to get even bigger as Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Friday that it will now accept collateral in the form of a popular token issued by BlackRock. The token, known as BUIDL, trades at $1 and is backed by a reserve of Treasury bills and other safe, short-term assets. The news of the Binance tie-up is significant because it will likely further increase the popularity of BUIDL, which the world’s largest asset manager launched last year. Since then, its market cap has grown to over $2.5 billion. BUIDL operates much like a stablecoin, and is often used as collateral for trading crypto derivatives. It is available, though, only to large institutional investors, including private equity firms and hedge funds, that invest at least $5 million into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is especially attractive to big investors since, unlike stablecoins like Tether and USDC, it pays out the yield it collects from its reserves. The current yield is roughly around 4%, with BlackRock charging a management fee of 0.2% to 0.5%. To create the token, BlackRock works with a firm called Securitize that specializes in issuing digital assets. In an interview with Fortune, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said BUIDL is attractive to institutional traders because of the yield it pays, but also because it is viewed by exchanges as high value collateral that can allow its holders to borrow more. Domingo also said that tokenized assets are gaining popularity more broadly because they offer a quick and efficient way to settle trades. “In capital markets, every transaction involves updating a ledger. Right now, the ledgers are built on software from the 1970s, and the process is siloed,” said Domingo. In contrast, he noted, blockchains are easy to access and can settle trades almost instantly. As part of its latest push deeper into crypto, BlackRock will also issue a new class of shares of BUIDL on the BNB chain, a blockchain launched by Binance that is today largely decentralized. Binance’s decision to add BUIDL comes at a time when the exchange giant is increasing ties to the traditional financial sector. In a statement, the company’s Head of VIP & Institutional, Catherine Chen, said adding BUIDL came partly in response to customer requests. “Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements,” said Chen. Friday’s BUIDL news comes after other big crypto derivative platforms, including Coinbase-owned Deribit, did the same in recent months. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited 2,310 Bitcoin worth $222 million and 43,240 Ethereum worth around $137 million into Coinbase today. The transfer represents the latest institutional movement involving the two leading crypto assets amid ongoing ETF activity. BlackRock’s recent Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits to Coinbase have sparked speculation about potential selling pressure following ETF outflows. Roughly $867 million exited US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, alongside $260 million withdrawn from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest daily outflow among crypto ETPs.

Title: Stock Futures Slide As Tech Selloff Continues—Bitcoin Slips To Six-Month Low

BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff andTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Nvidia and Tesla headlined broader gains across tech stocks on Friday afternoon, leading a rebound for major indexes a day after markets posted their worst declines in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped roughly 100 points (0.2%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq added 0.7% as of Friday afternoon, after each index fell more than 1% earlier in the day and dropped 1.6%, 1.6% and 2.2% on Thursday, respectively, in their largest single-day losses since October. Stocks recovered on Friday following a widespread rout on Thursday, during which investors dumped AI stocks amid general economic uncertainty, after the U.S. ended the longest government shutdown in history, with added concerns the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates next month. Markets also appeared to react to the White House announcing that employment and inflation data for October and September would be at least partially released, after previously the data would “likely never” be published, as economists projected inflation to remain high while the labor market likely deteriorated further. Nvidia rose 1.5% to around $189, adding to a 1.6% increase for Tesla, after both megacap stocks slumped 0.4% and 2.4% earlier in the day, respectively. Other stocks turned positive by Friday afternoon, including AMD (up 1.5%), Palantir (1.9%), Broadcom (0.9%), Apple (0.8%), Microsoft (1.1%) and Intel (0.1%), among others, while Amazon (down 0.3%) and Alphabet (0.4%) remained in the negative. UnitedHealth Group headlined losses across the Dow as shares traded down 3%, followed by Nike (2.5%), American Express (1.7%) and Walt Disney (1.7%). The cryptocurrency market was also hit by a selloff, with the price of bitcoin dropping below $96,000 for the first time in six months before paring back earlier losses. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to around $96,031 after earlier falling to as low as $94,592, the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency since May. Ether, the token with the second-largest market cap, dropped to $3,130, down more than 10.3% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana’s SOL and Binance’s BNB, are down 8.8%, 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. Crypto-linked stocks similarly declined, including Strategy (down 3.9%) and Coinbase (1.3%). It appears the broader crypto market is reeling from traders lowering odds of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, as key economic data remains delayed, leading to investors pressuring riskier assets, according to Bloomberg. Liquidity has also plummeted: Exchange-traded funds investing in bitcoin reported new outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest withdrawal since they were introduced in January 2024, according to CoinGlass

The group met with investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard during non-deal roadshows last week ahead of the bond issue likely to close by January-end, the sources said, requesting anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to media. Goswami Infratech, PIMCO, Vanguard and BlackRock did not reply to a Reuters email seeking comment. The real estate and civil engineering company is planning to raise around ₹2,500 crore ($2.8 billion) through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue, and is willing to offer a yield of 19.75 per cent, the sources said. The yield being offered on these notes is comparable to what another SP group entity Porteast Investment offered when it raised ₹28,600 crore in the largest ever bond sale for India in May. Talks are at an early stage and no investment commitments have been made so far, the sources added. The funds will be used to refinance its outstanding ₹8,815 crore in high-yield notes maturing in April 2026 and another loan, as well as for other debt-related and corporate purposes. The company has already repaid more than a third of the earlier bond, according to Care Ratings, which maintains a BB-rating on the papers. The new issue will be secured by the SP Group's 9.2 per cent stake in Tata Sons, held via its subsidiary Cyrus Investments.

November 14, 2025 07:38 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Biofertilizers Market - Types, Microorganisms and Applications" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The biofertilizers market is experiencing strong growth, expected to reach US$2.6 billion in 2024 and surpass US$5.1 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 12.3%. This growth is propelled by expanding organic farming, environmental concerns about chemical fertilizers, and increasing demand for pesticide-free produce. Government incentives, national sustainability programs, and technical advancements in microbial formulation and precision agriculture also contribute to this upward trend. The burgeoning organic food sector, coupled with greater awareness of soil regeneration and sustainable practices like micro-irrigation, is accelerating market expansion, notably in Asia Pacific, Europe, and South America. Regional Market Insights North America, the leading region with a 36.8% market share in 2024, benefits from advanced farming practices, regulatory support, and growing consumer demand for organic produce. The U.S. spearheads regional growth due to USDA programs and precision agriculture, encouraging farmers to adopt biofertilizers for enhanced soil fertility and improved crop resilience. Conversely, Asia Pacific is anticipated to exhibit the fastest growth with a CAGR of 13.5% from 2024 to 2030, driven by population growth, increased food demand, and a shift towards organic farming. India and China lead this trend, bolstered by government subsidies and innovative nutrient management systems. Market Segmentation by Type Nitrogen fixation holds the largest share, contributing to 70.3% of the market in 2024, owing to its effectiveness in boosting soil fertility and crop yields. Biofertilizers like Rhizobium and Azotobacter enhance nutrient absorption, making them preferred solutions for nitrogen-deficient soils. Meanwhile, the phosphate-solubilizing segment is set for rapid growth at a 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, addressing phosphorus lock-up issues in soils and improving crop quality. Microorganism Type Analysis The Rhizobium segment dominates with a 26.2% share in 2024, owing to its symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capabilities with leguminous crops, reducing synthetic fertilizer reliance and improving yields. In contrast, the Mycorrhiza segment is likely to experience the fastest growth at 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, due to its role in nutrient absorption and plant resistance enhancement. Application Insights In 2024, seed treatment emerges as the top application, accounting for 61.2% of the market due to its efficacy in boosting seed germination and nutrient uptake. Meanwhile, soil treatment is projected to witness the fastest growth at a 12.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, driven by the need to improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Market by Crop Type In 2024, cereals and grains command the largest segment with a 46.2% share, driven by high global demand for organic staples and extensive cultivation areas. Alternatively, the oilseeds and pulses segment is expected to grow the fastest at 12.9% CAGR, spurred by rising organic oil demand and government biofertilizer promotion.

Title: Lenihan: Ireland need both a win and a performance

There were always going to be changes for the Australia game. The Japan game was going to see the younger players given a chance. It's great to see Mack Hansen back in the side. All of his 27 caps have been on the wing. It's a first opportunity at full-back and I'm really looking forward to seeing him. Paddy McCarthy is starting up front ahead of Andrew Porter. He's only been involved in 10 games for Leinster. He's up against a really experienced operator in Alan Ala'alatoa, whose brother Michael played for Leinster. In the back row, I felt that when Caelan Doris was shifted to number 7 that he'd start there this week. Josh van der Flier has been such an outstanding player in that position but I think Andy (Farrell) is looking for alternatives. Sam Prendergast is back at 10, which was always going to happen. Jack Crowley, I think, is earmarked to play against South Africa but that will depend on what happens tomorrow. Not only do we need a win, we need a performance. I think the fact that Italy beat Australia last week, if anything, puts more pressure on Ireland. South Africa are coming down the line. I think Ireland will win but they have to lift performance. The only thing that makes me nervous is one man - and that's Joe Schmidt. We know what he can do. He's an outstanding coach and he'll want to win this one.

Title: This Amazing Early Black Friday Deal Makes the Meta Quest 3S Even Better Value

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. CNET's top budget virtual reality headset is even cheaper right now, with some retailers offering instant credit, too. Get it while you can. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. Black Friday is coming up fast and it's an excellent chance to pick up all sorts of tech. While it's great to stock up on essentials when they're on sale, we always like to peek at a few luxuries, too. They're just easier to justify when the price is right. Right now, that means it's a great time to think about getting a good virtual reality headset. The Meta Quest 3S, which is already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Best Buy and Amazon. You can get the 128GB model with a game included for just $249 at Best Buy. If you want the 256GB model, the headset on its own is down to $330 plus a $50 credit thrown in at both of those retailers. This deal ends Sunday at Best Buy and we assume Amazon will follow, so you'll need to be quick if you want it. If you shop at Amazon, you won't get a discount on the 128GB model, nor does it come with any credit. However, the 256GB option includes Batman and it's $70 off, bringing it down to $330. Amazon is also throwing in a $50 credit that you can spend on anything at Amazon. If you're heading to Best Buy instead, you can save $50 on the 128GB model, plus it comes with The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners game. And best of all, Best Buy is throwing in a $50 gift card that you can spend in-store or online. Best Buy has the same $70 off offer on the 256GB model and is also throwing in the $50 gift card with this model, too. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. The Meta Quest 3S has improved CPU and graphics, which makes it great for gamers. It also has a noticeably lighter design compared to the previous Quest 2 and it has approximately 3 hours of battery life. It's the budget version of the Quest 3 headset but it's like comparing the iPhone 17 to the iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro version comes with added benefits but the basic version should serve all of your needs without breaking a virtual sweat. CNET's Scott Stein, VR expert, said in his review, "If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed-reality evolution in the years to come. And if you're thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy, and you're not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be." Stein also labeled it as "by far the best value in VR," in his review. Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving but it's rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don't pop up every day. If you've been wanting to invest in one of Meta's headsets, you should do it now while it's available at a lower-than-usual price.

Title: Fear Not: Bitcoin Whale Selling Doesn’t Point To A Crypto Meltdown—Analysts

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin dropped to $96,000 on heavy selling Friday, and falling risk appetite, leaving traders and analysts parsing whether this is normal profit-taking or a larger turning point for the market. According to on-chain and market reports, the drop wiped out more than $700 million in long positions and left November down by more than 10%. Reports have disclosed that a wallet tied to trader Owen Gunden moved 2,400 Bitcoin — about $237 million — onto the Kraken exchange, a transfer tracked by blockchain watcher Arkham. Based on analysis by Glassnode, long-term holders’ average daily spending rose from over 12,000 BTC per day in early July to roughly 26,000 BTC per day as of this week. OWEN GUNDEN JUST SOLD ANOTHER $290M BTC Owen Gunden just moved all of the remaining BTC out of his accounts. He deposited over HALF of his holdings directly into Kraken, depositing a total of $290.7M of BTC into Kraken. He now has only $250M of Bitcoin remaining. pic.twitter.com/ZUB3aToAgH — Arkham (@arkham) November 13, 2025 That pattern, Glassnode analysts say, looks like orderly distribution by older holders rather than a sudden mass exit. It is being framed as late-cycle profit-taking: regular, steady, and spread out. According to Santiment, Bitcoin has fallen below $100K for the second time this month, triggering a burst of fear and worried posts from retail traders. 📉 Bitcoin has dumped below $100K for the second time this month. Predictably, this has caused a wave of FUD and concerned social media posts from retail traders. As shown below: 🟥: Significant bullish/greedy bias (usually when markets are getting too much FOMO, prices will go… pic.twitter.com/rowUv3xIMd — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 13, 2025 Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research, disclosed that structured selling and steady rotation of gains often show up in late-cycle phases. He cautioned that this phase doesn’t automatically signal a final peak, provided there are still buyers ready to take in the extra supply. Being in a late cycle doesn’t mean the market has hit a ceiling, he pointed out. It just shows momentum has eased, and bigger forces like macro trends and liquidity are now in control, he said. “Rate-cut doubts and recent market weakness have slowed the climb, not ended it,” Liu said. In other words, there’s no meltdown or anything like it. On-chain indicators are being watched closely; Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit ratio stood near 0.476, a level some traders interpret as hinting at short-term lows forming. That reading is only one of several signals, Liu added, and must be tracked alongside liquidity and macro conditions. A closer look at the monthly average spending by long-term holders reveals a clear trend: outflows have climbed from roughly 12.5k BTC/day in early July to 26.5k BTC/day today (30D-SMA). This steady rise reflects increasing distribution pressure from older investor cohorts — a… pic.twitter.com/wECe58CV66 — glassnode (@glassnode) November 13, 2025 The cryptocurrency sell-off came as crypto-related stocks plunged. Broader markets were weak as well, with the Nasdaq down 2% and the S&P 500 off 1.3%. Cipher Mining fell 14%, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 dropped 13%, while MARA Holdings and Bitmine Immersion slid over 10%. Coinbase and Strategy were down about 7%. Based on reports, large institutional flows have pressured prices. Firms including BlackRock, Binance and Wintermute reportedly sold more than $1 billion in Bitcoin, a wave of selling that produced a quick 5% drop inside minutes. Meanwhile, social sentiment turned sharply negative, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit 15, reflecting “extreme fear” among traders.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

A "difficult but necessary decision". Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet more layoffs at the studio, calling it a "difficult but necessary decision". In a post on LinkedIn, the studio said it has "parted ways" with just under 30 employees. These employees came from a variety of projects and departments within the company, with Crystal Dynamics calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". The developer additionally cited the next entry in the Tomb Raider series, which the studio is working on with Amazon, as part of the reason for its decision. "To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimise the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," it wrote. The post thanked those impacted by the layoffs for "their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways", adding: "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition." Closing, Crystal Dynamics said it appreciated support during these changes at the studio, and that it "[looks] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". This most recent wave of layoffs at the studio is at least the fourth in the last two years. In March, Crystal Dynamics laid off 17 "talented" staff members, again calling it a "difficult decision". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

Geoff Colvin is a senior editor-at-large at Fortune, covering leadership, globalization, wealth creation, the infotech revolution, and related issues. Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation. No silver bullet for New York In the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich tells Diane Brady and Kristin Stoller that most global cities are grappling with affordability issues. "New York is a global capital, but it comes at a price,” he said, citing Vienna as a city that’s doing well but weaponizing affordability as a political tool while London is “dark and it’s not lively anymore” because too many wealthy buyers have bought second, third and fourth homes in the city center. AI bubble fear hurts stock markets Stocks markets fell dramatically yesterday—and the selling looks set to continue today, according to the futures markets—led by investors expressing their disapproval over spending on AI. Oracle shares are down almost 30% over the last month as investors flee Larry Ellison’s debt-fuelled pivot to AI. “The Big Short” investor closes investment firm, maintains AI bubble stance Investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 housing bubble and dramatized in the film “The Big Short,” closed his investment firm on Wednesday and quickly took to X to continue his warnings about an AI bubble. Burry, who has already bet $1 billion against an AI bubble, explained how companies like Meta and Oracle are understating the depreciation of their AI investments to inflate profits and play down their massive capital expenditure programs.

Title: In the age of AI, CEOs quietly signal that layoffs are a badge of honor

Geoff Colvin is a senior editor-at-large at Fortune, covering leadership, globalization, wealth creation, the infotech revolution, and related issues. Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation. No silver bullet for New York In the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich tells Diane Brady and Kristin Stoller that most global cities are grappling with affordability issues. "New York is a global capital, but it comes at a price,” he said, citing Vienna as a city that’s doing well but weaponizing affordability as a political tool while London is “dark and it’s not lively anymore” because too many wealthy buyers have bought second, third and fourth homes in the city center. AI bubble fear hurts stock markets Stocks markets fell dramatically yesterday—and the selling looks set to continue today, according to the futures markets—led by investors expressing their disapproval over spending on AI. Oracle shares are down almost 30% over the last month as investors flee Larry Ellison’s debt-fuelled pivot to AI. “The Big Short” investor closes investment firm, maintains AI bubble stance Investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 housing bubble and dramatized in the film “The Big Short,” closed his investment firm on Wednesday and quickly took to X to continue his warnings about an AI bubble. Burry, who has already bet $1 billion against an AI bubble, explained how companies like Meta and Oracle are understating the depreciation of their AI investments to inflate profits and play down their massive capital expenditure programs.

Title: Verizon Will Reportedly Cut 15,000 Jobs Next Week

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces third round of layoffs this year, 30 workers affected

Full Content:
Decision made to "optimise the continued development" of Tomb Raider and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve" Crystal Dynamics has announced a third round of layoffs this year, affecting 30 employees "across various departments and projects." In a post shared on LinkedIn, the developer said it needed to "optimise the continued development of [its] flagship Tomb Raider game" and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve." Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider game was announced in 2022, when it signed a partnership with Amazon Games to publish the title. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways," the studio wrote. "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support during this transition." It added: "We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future." In August, Crystal Dynamics announced an unspecified amount of workers were made redundant. It cited "evolving business conditions" for the decision, which was made to ensure the "long-term health of [its] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." This came after the first round of layoffs this year in March, which affected 17 employees. At the time, the developer said the reason was to "better align [its] current business and the studio's future success." Crystal Dynamics was also the co-developer of the Perfect Dark reboot with The Initiative. The latter was closed and the game was cancelled as part of larger layoffs at Microsoft. These redundancies affected several divisions at Microsoft Gaming, including King, ZeniMax, Raven Software, Turn 10, and Blizzard. Rare's Everwild was also cancelled. In September 2023, 10 people were laid off at Crystal Dynamics following restructuring at its parent company Embracer.

Title: US regulator mulls guidance for tokenized deposit insurance, stablecoins

Time Published: 2025-11-14T05:57:37Z

Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill said the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of year. The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the regulatory body overseeing banks in the US, is reportedly considering guidance for tokenized deposit insurance and plans to launch an application process for stablecoins by year’s end. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill, who has made bullish statements about tokenization in the past, told the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Fintech Conference on Thursday that the regulator will eventually release guidance around tokenized deposit insurance, according to reports. The FDIC protects depositors in the event of a bank failure and insures money in accounts at banks that are insured by the regulator. “My view for a long time has been that a deposit is a deposit. Moving a deposit from a traditional-finance world to a blockchain or distributed-ledger world shouldn’t change the legal nature of it,” Hill said, as reported by Bloomberg. Regulators and Wall Street have shown serious interest in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector this year. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year, with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one of the most prominent players in the space and launched a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL in 2024. At the same time, Hill reportedly announced the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of 2025 as part of its duties in crafting rules under the GENIUS Act, according to Law360. Related: Tokenization demand is no longer tied to Bitcoin: Galaxy executive He said it’s still too early to know how many institutions will be interested, but the FDIC staff is working on the standards around capital requirements, reserve requirements and risk management for FDIC-regulated stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins have also been a high-growth area, with banks worldwide exploring this technology. The market capitalization of stablecoins is approximately $305 billion as of Friday, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.

Title: Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds as 43-Day U.S. Shutdown Ends, Vitalik Buterin Outlines Scaling Roadmap

Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after the U.S. government ended its historic 43-day shutdown, an event that had weighed heavily on investor confidence across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect ETH price is currently hovering above the $3,400 support zone after a volatile week marked by ETF outflows, declining volume, and intense bearish sentiment. The broader crypto market reacted positively to news of the shutdown’s resolution, helping Ethereum climb 3.18% on the day and outperform Bitcoin with a 3% gain. Analysts now expect ETH to rise toward $3,814 by November 18, representing a potential 10.37% short-term upside. Despite the improved macro backdrop, Ethereum remains in a challenging technical position. Key support lies at $3,333 and $3,300, while resistance at $3,590 and $3,666 will determine whether ETH can break its current downtrend. ETF products continue to show weakness, with all nine Ethereum ETFs recording zero inflows and a combined $107 million in outflows, suggesting institutions remain cautious. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added optimism to the week by outlining a refreshed scaling roadmap and highlighting DeFi’s evolution into a viable global savings tool. He emphasized that the DeFi ecosystem is now “night and day” safer compared to 2020, citing better security audits, stronger protocols, and improved user-fund recovery mechanisms through innovations like the “walkaway test.” Central to Buterin’s roadmap is Ethereum’s ongoing Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling strategy. With rollups, data availability upgrades, and new high-throughput solutions, such as systems already achieving over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin believes Ethereum is on track to support the next wave of DeFi adoption. He urged developers to maintain Ethereum’s core values: openness, censorship resistance, and interoperability. Buterin warned that abandoning these principles risks turning Ethereum into a “walled garden,” undermining the ecosystem’s global mission. A growing bright spot for Ethereum is the explosive expansion of tokenised real-world assets (RWAs). More than $200 billion worth of RWAs now sit on-chain, driven by major institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The BUIDL fund’s tokenised Treasury products, built natively on Ethereum, showcase the network’s rising importance in traditional finance. Institutional RWA assets have surged nearly 2,000% since January 2024, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals even as short-term volatility persists. Related Reading: European Banking Regulator Says EU Crypto Framework Addresses ECB’s Stablecoin Concerns Technically, Ethereum remains in a descending channel from its failed August rally toward $5,000. Analysts note that a decisive breakout above $3,700 could flip market structure bullish and reopen paths toward $4,700, especially if macro stability continues after the shutdown settlement.

While the German chancellor burns taxpayer money in the Amazon jungle to “save” the rainforests, his own advisor, Clemens Fuest, is warning of the return of a planned economy and looming shortages. Meanwhile, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen rallies the climate faithful for yet another harvest season. A Home Game in Belém Last Friday was something of a home game for Chancellor Friedrich Merz. At the climate summit in Belém, Brazil -- which, incidentally, translates as “Bethlehem” and was meant to remind what remains of the local Christian community of the “holy” significance of the gathering -- he found himself among old friends. The media, and only the media, dictate what exists and what doesn’t. And this time, everything revolved around Ursula von der Leyen’s sermon on the state of the world’s climate, cast in simple yet precise apocalyptic tones. Von der Leyen Takes the Stage In Belém, she clearly set the tone -- eager to keep the panic level demanded by climate groups like Fridays for Future as high as humanly possible. Let’s be honest: COP30, like the entire climate club, has already seen its best days. Things ran much smoother when, alongside the EU’s capital pump, the Americans were still flooding the “green economy” with ever-growing rivers of cash. But that party ended with Donald Trump’s election. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are now aligning their ETFs and investment vehicles once again with real economic demand -- that of a world hungry for energy to feed exploding data centers, AI models, autonomous vehicles, and chip production. Not that anyone at COP30, or in Berlin for that matter, seems troubled by such details. New capital sources are being “opened,” CO2 taxes are flowing, and Germany’s many “special funds” are ready to be deployed. Last Exit: The Climate Business Von der Leyen once again illustrated Brussels’ unshakable faith that a state-planned green pseudo-economy represents the final exit from the accelerating economic crisis of our age. By 2030, she wants to triple the global share of renewables and double energy efficiency. What, one wonders, do the Chinese think of that -- as they build new coal plants at record pace? Or the Americans, who just quit the Climate Inc. altogether, opting for a deregulated energy market freed from the green command economy? Von der Leyen, however, invited her audience on a journey to fairyland -- EU-style, dreamy, green-tinted, and disconnected from reality. The Commission President declared, with evident pride, that EU member states now have a “crystal-clear commitment” to reduce CO2 emissions by 90 percent by 2040. Europe, she said, is “on track” -- and now stands ready to “share its experience” with partners around the world. The whole world, von der Leyen insisted, should benefit from the “advantages” (sic!) of the energy transition. For the German delegation -- representing the economically crumbling Vatican of the climate cult -- that must have been the moment when even the long drink froze in hand. The CO2 Business Model No one bends reality into green, molten steel quite like Ursula von der Leyen. A master of turning dysfunction into virtue, she knows that marketing is everything -- and the best marketing for a broken product lies in perpetual apocalypse. Under her spell, even the chancellor couldn’t resist. Merz promptly pledged €6 billion of German taxpayers’ money to “save” the tropical forests. And let’s not kid ourselves: this money will make some climate entrepreneurs and their clans very happy indeed. Which, after all, is the point. The climate economy, in all its tangled branches -- insulation panels, heat pumps, wind turbines planted in forests -- thrives on a moral narrative that translates every act of human life into carbon sin. That’s how taxpayers are blackmailed and the middle class is bled dry. The method requires only a packed travel schedule and omnipresence in the media cycle. The Dream Sequence Reaches Its Climax It all felt a bit like Jack Kerouac’s Book of Dreams: episodes blending the absurd, the half-true, and the utterly fantastical. Von der Leyen reached the peak of her detachment from reality when she turned political. Carbon pricing, she preached, had “proven one of the strongest instruments for climate protection,” effectively shutting down any homefront debate about the collapsing carbon credit system. Nothing may exist that the central planning office brands as heresy. Thus, the recent criticism by the CEOs of BASF and Evonik -- two pillars of German industry -- must be dismissed as “conflicted.” To comfort the mourning congregation of Germany’s shrinking industrial base, Merz proposed a predictable remedy: subsidies and a state-guaranteed “industrial electricity price.” One thing remains constant: higher taxes and levies will, supposedly, keep the global temperature in check. On that point, everyone in the faith agrees. Back to the Climate Vatican During his rainforest pilgrimage, the German delegation emitted roughly 65 tons of CO2 -- not bad for a summit about reducing emissions. (Assuming the chancellor’s Air Force One is airworthy, it still doesn’t run on sunflower oil.) But Merz needn’t travel so far to witness the absurd theater of the CO2 faithful. Back home, the Bundestag is working with Prussian precision to turn the country into one of the most dazzling tragicomic stages of our time. On Thursday, parliament passed the amendment to the Carbon Storage Act -- allowing CO2 to be captured, transported, and stored under the seabed of the North Sea. The technology, known as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), is supposed to help “energy-intensive” sectors like cement, steel, and chemicals -- industries the government blames for the climate crisis in the first place. In plain English: subsidies are now being poured into a brand-new infrastructure that serves an industry which produces nothing. The capital siphoned from the free market through tax privileges and green subsidies will literally be sunk into the sea. That’s East German economics -- wrapped in eco-soundtrack. The End is Nigh We can conclude that the media have succeeded in transmitting the festive mood from Brussels’ central committee back home -- business is running smoothly, apocalypse sells well, and the Amazon provides the perfect backdrop. No piranhas in sight during the boat ride either. But as you know from your own parties, there’s always that one guest who ruins the buzz -- the one who dares to bring up politics or question the narrative. That role now belongs to economist and government advisor Clemens Fuest. He couldn’t resist reminding everyone, in an interview with Bild am Sonntag, that Germany -- after years of stagnation (he politely avoided saying “recession”) -- is heading straight toward shortage economics. That, of course, describes the classic modus vivendi of socialist regimes, where a small, insulated elite allocates resources at will and doles out investments according to political loyalty. Sound familiar? Fuest might want to ask himself where exactly we are in the economic timeline -- and what role the climate circus plays in establishing this very regime he’s warning about. Should enlightenment strike, his ethical duty as a scientist would be clear: to stand on the side of freedom.

November 13, 2025 23:57 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its two Explorer-class spacecraft for NASA and the University of California Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory have been successfully launched, beginning their journey to Mars to study the Red Planet’s magnetosphere. NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission was launched by Blue Origin on November 13, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 03:55 p.m. EST. Rocket Lab has successfully established contact with the spacecraft and they are generating power. Now in orbit, the spacecraft will undergo commissioning by Rocket Lab’s spacecraft operations team in the coming days, beginning with early checkouts including orientation stabilization and solar array deployment, followed by commissioning of flight computers, multiple antenna, guidance and navigation sensors and actuators, and the propulsion system leading up to the mission’s first maneuvers. Rocket Lab’s Explorer-class spacecraft platform is a high delta-V, interplanetary member of its advanced satellite family. From contract award to launch, ESCAPADE moved from design to spacecraft completion in just three and a half years – an aggressive timeline for a Mars mission. This was made possible by the Company’s vertically integrated supply chain, which brings the production of solar arrays, reaction wheels, propellant tanks, star trackers, radios, avionics, flight software, and more entirely in-house. “Mars missions have historically been measured in decades and come with price tags in the billions or hundreds of millions. With this mission we’re bringing Mars closer, proving real interplanetary science can be done faster and more cost-effectively to unlock the solar system,” said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. “ESCAPADE is a major first, not just for Rocket Lab, but for commercial interplanetary science. It’s the result of bold goals from NASA and UC Berkeley, enabled by our end-to-end spacecraft capabilities. We’re proud to play a part in this mission and even prouder to know they’re continuing our legacy at the Red Planet.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: "As PI, I'm very grateful to have a top-notch joint ops team at UC Berkeley and Rocket Lab taking care of the twin spacecraft out there in space. I'm both elated and relieved to see NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft healthy post-launch and looking forward to the next chapter of their journey to help us understand Mars' dynamic space weather environment." Now in orbit, a complex and extended journey begins for Blue and Gold, with trajectory design led by Advanced Space LLC. The alignment between Earth and Mars does not currently allow ESCAPADE to use a traditional direct-to-Mars transfer. Instead, ESCAPADE will launch into a “loiter” (or “Earth-proximity”) orbit that loops around Earth’s Lagrange point 2 (about a million miles from Earth, opposite the Sun) until the next planetary alignment window. Once the planets have reached the ideal alignment in fall 2026, the ESCAPADE spacecraft will use an Earth gravity assist to begin the journey to Mars. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab and UC Berkeley spacecraft operators will command the spacecraft to conduct deep-space maneuvers, known as trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs). The TCMs will boost the spacecraft’s energy to reach Mars and provide navigation control to target their unique orbit insertion corridors. The spacecraft are scheduled to arrive at Mars in September 2027. The spacecraft will begin to transition to their first science formation in 2028. ESCAPADE will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips ions from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.

The findings, based on responses from 1,396 professionals, highlight widespread abuse of legal loopholes by global tech firms operating in the country. For most affected employees, the layoff process lacked both legal compliance and humane communication. 72 per cent were informed within two days of their last working day. The rate was especially high at Amazon, Target and Freshworks, exceeding 90 per cent. Only 18 per cent said they received any advance notice of one to three months as mandated by law. According to Blind, many MNCs operating in India’s tech and service sectors have long taken advantage of a gap in the country’s labor framework that excludes IT and managerial staff from the “workmen” category. This allows them to legally bypass mandatory notice periods and government approval under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), leaving tens of millions of white-collar professionals outside the scope of labor protections. 37 per cent were informed via Zoom or Teams calls, 23 per cent received impersonal email notifications, and 13 per cent discovered they had been terminated only after their system access was suddenly cut off. Even when sudden layoffs technically breach the spirit of the law, companies frequently use “in lieu of notice” payments to avoid penalties — paying a short-term severance instead of giving advance warning. This loophole enables overnight, American-style layoffs that would otherwise be illegal under Indian labor standards. On Blind, several affected professionals shared how these practices are eroding trust and mental security within India’s tech scene. “It’s a cruel psychological game: keep people anxious, hoping some will quit voluntarily, saving the company money on severance,” wrote an employee from Amazon India. Another user from Samsung pointed to shared resilience, saying, “All I can think of is to become proficient to do something on our own. It could be small, but that ability gives some sense of security.” Published on November 14, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Exowatt has a rock-solid plan to provide cheap, abundant energy for AI data centers
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/13/exowatt-rock-solid-plan-provide-cheap-abundant-energy-ai-data-centers/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T02:32:44Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 21:32 EST / NOVEMBER 13 2025 by Mike Wheatley Exowatt Inc., a solar-thermal energy startup backed by OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and other high-profile investors, wants to solve the artificial intelligence energy crisis with millions of hot rocks. To do that, it has raised millions of dollars – $50 million in fact, led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries. Today’s round also saw participation from other investors that included Atomic, Bridge Bay Ventures, the Florida Opportunity Fund, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global and Massive VC. The round is described as an extension of the company’s original $70 million Series A, which closed in April. Altman’s involvement stems from its original seed funding round in 2024, where he was one of several angel investors. Exowatt says its thermal battery technology, powered by solar energy, has the potential to provide enormous AI data centers with electricity at rates as low as one cent per kilowatt-hour, which would make it around 90% cheaper than the average U.S. grid rate. If it can do this, it’s sure to be of enormous interest to AI data center operators such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Oracle Corp., which are all desperate for energy as they scramble to build out their infrastructure. With data centers springing up across the country, operators are desperate to secure a power source for them, but grid queues in some locations can stretch for years. As a result, data centers are being built faster than power suppliers can keep up. Exowatt is pitching a somewhat unconventional solution to this looming crisis, with millions of superheated rocks held in storage that can provide energy around the clock. The company’s solar-thermal energy works by using concentrated solar power to heat up special ceramic or rock-based materials to temperatures as high as 1,200°C when the sun is shining. These materials act as thermal batteries, releasing the stored heat to power steam turbines that generate electricity, even when the sun goes down. It transforms rocks into a power source, and once the system is set up and in place, it can provide electricity much more cheaply than through conventional means, which typically cost from eight to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The math is compelling, especially when considering the future energy requirements of data centers. Today, these facilities consume about 1% of the world’s electricity, but the demand for AI is forecast to push that up to around 3% to 4% by the end of the decade, Exowatt says. Exowatt’s challenge is that it needs to gear up its manufacturing operation to produce 1 million thermal battery units per year. It said this target is necessary for it to deliver on its penny-per-kWh promise through economies of scale. Doing so is easier said than done, though, considering that Exowatt has only built a handful of batteries so far. Still, it has gotten enough backing to at least attempt to reach that goal. Altman is one of a number of voices in the AI industry who has been quite vocal about the need to solve the looming power bottleneck, and many of his rivals are pursuing different ideas. For instance, Meta Platforms Inc. is exploring nuclear energy, particularly the use of small modular reactors that can be located close to its data centers. Google LLC has also invested in a number of nuclear energy startups, as has Amazon. Aside from exploiting more fossil fuels, renewable energy is really the main alternative to nuclear power, and it is certainly popular with environmentalists, but the problem is that solar- and wind-farms require affordable and reliable storage solutions to be able to meet AI’s power demands 24/7. Most existing energy storage systems use lithium-ion batteries, but they’re very expensive and there are concerns around the availability of the rare earth elements needed in their construction. Thermal storage provides some advantages. The rocks and ceramics are much cheaper, and they’re also more durable. Exowatt says its rock-based storage systems can maintain heat for about five days and they never degrade – unlike lithium-ion batteries, which gradually lose capacity over the endless charging cycles they have to endure. That said, there are questions about the real-world performance of Exowatt’s system, which has never been attempted at such a large scale, as well as grid integration. Previous solar-thermal energy projects have suffered with efficiency problems and unforeseen maintenance costs, and Exowatt will have to show that its batteries can deliver on its cost promises and operate in diverse climates. That may be why the company hasn’t yet announced a specific timeline for deploying its technology, nor any major customers. Even so, Exowatt has the capital, the demand and timing on its side, and if it can scale up its technology to achieve its ambitious price targets, it might just become the rock on which the future AI industry is built.

Title: Amazon slashes nearly 700 jobs in New York alone amid plans of 14,000 job cuts – here's what we know

E-commerce giant Amazon cut 660 jobs in Manhattan in October, according to a report by the New York Post citing New York State government records. Amazon confirmed that nine office locations were affected, impacting only corporate employees. The most affected sites were two locations. The 450 W 33rd St offices near Hudson Yards experienced 233 layoffs, and the 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship, acquired by Amazon in 2020 for $1 billion, had 182 layoffs, the report said, citing Monday filings from the state Department of Labour. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon, and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and the AI revolution in motion.” The latest development after Amazon confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy highlighted growing use of AI. During Amazon's earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not due to cost-cutting measures or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said that the employees affected did not align with Amazon's culture. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” The layoffs are impacting various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post last month. Galetti hinted at further job cuts, mentioning Amazon's plan to hire in key areas in 2026. The company reportedly plans to cut approximately 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of layoffs, which will constitute about 9% of its global office-based workforce, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the development. Indicating the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Who’s Afraid of the AI Boogeyman?

Time Published: 2025-11-13T23:00:00Z

It is becoming ever more obvious that many people fear rapidly developing Artificial Intelligence (AI), for various reasons, such as its supposed superiority, compared to humans, as far as processing and manipulating information is concerned, as well as its adaptability and efficiency in the workplace, which many fear would lead to the replacement of most human beings in the employment market. Amazon recently announced that it was replacing 14,000 individuals with AI robots, for example. Alex Valdes writes: The layoffs are reportedly the largest in Amazon history, and come just months after CEO Andy Jassy outlined his vision for how the company would rapidly ramp up its development of generative AI and AI agents. The cuts are the latest in a wave of layoffs this year as tech giants including Microsoft, Accenture, Salesforce and India’s TCS have reduced their workforces by thousands in what has become a frenzied push to invest in AI. Lest this is too disturbing to tolerate, contrast this with the reassuring statement, from an AI developer, to boot, that AI agents could not replace human beings. Brian Shilhavy points out that: Andrej Karpathy, one of the founding members of OpenAI, on Friday threw cold water on the idea that artificial general intelligence is around the corner. He also cast doubt on various assumptions about AI made by the industry’s biggest boosters, such as Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman. The highly regarded Karpathy called reinforcement learning—arguably the most important area of research right now—’terrible,’ said AI-powered coding agents aren’t as exciting as many people think, and said AI cannot reason about anything it hasn’t already been trained on. His comments, from a podcast interview with Dwarkesh Patel, struck a chord with some of the AI researchers we talk to, including those who have also worked at OpenAI and Anthropic. They also echoed comments we heard from researchers at the International Conference on Machine Learning earlier this year. A lot of Karpathy’s criticisms of his own field seem to boil down to a single point: As much as we like to anthropomorphize large language models, they’re not comparable to humans or even animals in the way they learn. For instance, zebras are up and walking around just a few minutes after they’re born, suggesting that they’re born with some level of innate intelligence, while LLMs have to go through immense trial and error to learn any new skill, Karpathy points out. This is already comforting, but lest the fear of AI persist, it can be dispelled further by elaborating on the differences between AI and human beings, which, if understood adequately, would drive home the realisation that such anxieties are mostly redundant (although others are not, as I shall argue below). The most obvious difference in question is the fact that AI (for example, ChatGPT) is dependent on being equipped with a vast database on which it draws to come up with answers to questions, which it formulates predictively through pattern recognition. Then, as pointed out above, even the most sophisticated AI has to be ‘trained’ to yield the information one seeks. Moreover, unlike humans, it lacks ‘direct’ access to experiential reality in perceptual, spatiotemporal terms – something which I have experienced frequently when confronted by people who draw on ChatGPT to question certain arguments. For example, when I gave a talk recently on how Freud and Hannah Arendt’s work – on civilisation and totalitarianism, respectively – enables one to grasp the character of the globalist onslaught against extant society, with a view to establishing a central, AI-controlled world government, someone in the audience produced a printout of ChatGPT’s response to the question, whether these two thinkers could indeed deliver the goods, as it were. Predictably, it summarised the relevant work of these two thinkers quite adequately, but was stumped by the requirement to show how it applies to the growing threat of totalitarian control in real time. My interlocutor used this as grounds to question my own assertions in this regard, on the assumption that the AI bot’s response was an indication that no such threat exists. Needless to stress, it was not difficult to repudiate this claim by reminding him of ChatGPT’s dependence on being supplied with the relevant data, while we humans have access to the latter on experiential grounds, which I proceeded to outline to him. The fear of AI also finds expression in science fiction, together with intimations of possible modes of resistance to AI-machines which may – probably would – attempt to exterminate their human creators, as has been imagined in science fiction cinema, including Moore’s Battlestar Galactica and Cameron’s Terminator films. It is not difficult to demonstrate that such products of popular culture frame the current symptoms of fear pertaining to AI in imaginary terms, which may be seen as a crystallisation of repressed, unconscious anxiety, related to what Freud called ‘the uncanny’ (unheimlich, in German; more on this below). Both Moore and Cameron elaborate on the likelihood that the very creatures engendered by human beings’ technological ingenuity will eventually turn on their creators to annihilate them. In Alex Garland’s Ex Machina (2014), again, one witnesses an AI ‘fembot’ called Ava, subtly manipulating her human counterparts to the point of her escape from confinement and their own destruction. Undeniably, these, and many other similar instances, are incontrovertible evidence of a hidden fear on the part of humanity that AI constitutes a possible threat to its own existence. Precisely because these fears are lodged in the human unconscious, however, they are not the main reason to take any threat posed by AI seriously, although they do comprise a valuable caveat. The chief reason for regarding AI as a legitimate source of intimidation does not arise from AI as such, as many readers probably already know. Rather, it concerns the manner in which the globalists intend to use AI to control what they perceive as the ‘useless eaters’ – the rest of us, in other words. And those of us who do not go along with their grandiose plans of total world control would fall victim to being ‘reprogrammed’ into compliant ‘sheeple’ by AI: Yuval Noah Harari has emerged from the shadows to brag about the new technology developed by WEF scientists which he warns has the power to destroy every human in the world by transforming them into transhuman entities. Harari has made clear who will survive the great depopulation event the elite have been warning us about for years. According to Harari, the global elite will survive thanks to a ‘technological Noah’s ark’ while the rest of us will be left to perish. In this vastly depopulated world, the elite will be free to change themselves into transhuman entities and become the gods they already believe themselves to be. But first the elite need to eliminate the non-compliant masses, those who are opposed to the anti-life and godless WEF agenda, and as Harari boasts, the elite now command the AI technology to ‘ethically’ destroy non-compliant humans by hijacking their brains. Disturbingly, Harari’s claims are grounded in reality and the WEF is rolling out the mind-control technology as we speak. Davos claims the tech can transform criminals, including those accused of thought crimes, into perfectly compliant globalist citizens who will never dissent again. There you have it – AI will be the tool, if the globalists have their way, of forcing us into submission. Needless to point out, this could only happen if sufficient numbers of people fail to resist their plans, and judging by the number of people who are showing their opposition to the would-be rulers of the world, this will not occur. Another way of gaining an understanding of the fear of AI is to liken it to what is commonly known as ‘the boogeyman.’ As some people may know, the ‘boogeyman’ (or ‘bogeyman’) – a creature of mythical proportions, which assumes different shapes and sizes in many cultures, often to scare children as a way of eliciting good behaviour – is variously presented as a monstrous, grotesque, or shapeless creature. As a little research indicates, the word derives from the Middle English term, ‘bogge,’ or ‘bugge,’ which means ‘scarecrow,’ or ‘frightening spectre.’ Being a quintessentially human phenomenon, it is not surprising that it has equivalent names in many folklore traditions and languages across the world. Just like languages, depictions of this frightening figure diverge strikingly, often attaining its ominous and scary character from the element of formlessness, such as the figure of ‘El Coco’ in Spanish-speaking countries, the ‘Sack Man’ in Latin America, and the ‘Babau’ in Italy, sometimes imagined as a tall, black-coated man. The boogeyman figure may be regarded as a kind of Jungian archetype, encountered in the collective unconscious, which probably originated centuries ago from parents’ need to frighten children into obedience by means of a version of the unknown. In South Africa, where I live, it sometimes assumes the shape of what indigenous people call the ‘tikoloshe’ – a malevolent, and sometimes mischievous, dwarfish figure with an enormous sexual appetite. Being an archetype, it has also made its way into a popular genre such as horror film, manifesting itself in grotesque characters such as Freddy Krueger, the eponymous ‘Nightmare on Elm Street.’ So, in what sense does AI resemble the ‘boogeyman?’ The latter is related to what Sigmund Freud memorably called ‘the uncanny,’ of which he writes (in The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, translated by James Strachey, 1974: 3676): ‘…the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar.’ This already hints at what he uncovers later in this essay, after uncovering the surprising fact that the German word for ‘homely,’ to wit, ‘heimlich,’ turns out to be ambivalent in its usage, so that it sometimes means the opposite of ‘homely,’ namely ‘unheimlich’ (‘unhomely,’ better translated as ‘uncanny’). That the concept of ‘the uncanny’ is suitable to grasp what I have in mind when I allude to ‘the fear of AI,’ becomes evident where Freud writes (referring to another author whose work on the ‘uncanny’ he regarded as important; Freud 1974: 3680): When we proceed to review the things, persons, impressions, events and situations which are able to arouse in us a feeling of the uncanny in a particularly forcible and definite form, the first requirement is obviously to select a suitable example to start on. Jentsch has taken as a very good instance ‘doubts whether an apparently animate being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might not be in fact animate;’ and he refers in this connection to the impression made by wax-work figures, ingeniously constructed dolls and automata. To these he adds the uncanny effect of epileptic fits, and of manifestations of insanity, because these excite in the spectator the impression of automatic, mechanical processes at work behind the ordinary appearance of mental activity. Here, already one encounters a trait of the uncanny that conspicuously applies to AI – the impression created by AI that it is somehow ‘alive.’ This was the case even of the first, ‘primitive’ computers, such as the one in the episode on the First Commandment, of Krzysztof Kieslowski’s 1989 television series regarding the Ten Commandments, called The Decalogue, where the words, ‘I am here,’ appear on the computer screen when the father and his son use it. The ominous implication in this episode is that if humanity were to replace God with AI, it would be disastrous for us, as shown in the fact that the father is sufficiently ‘rationalist’ to trust the computer’s calculations of the thickness of the ice on which his son skates, which turns out to be wrong, leading to the child’s death. Freud continues his investigation of the nature of ‘the uncanny’ by paying sustained attention to the work of E.T.A. Hoffman, whose stories are famous for producing a strong sense of the uncanny, particularly the tale of ‘The Sand-Man’ – ‘who tears out children’s eyes’ – which features, among several other uncanny figures (and very significantly), a beautiful, lifelike doll called Olympia. He then explains it by relating it in psychoanalytical terms to the castration complex – attached to the father figure – via the fear of losing one’s eyes (Freud 1974: 3683-3685). Freud continues his interpretation of the uncanny in a revealing manner by invoking a number of other psychoanalytically relevant aspects of experience, of which the following one appears to apply to AI (1974: 3694): …an uncanny effect is often and easily produced when the distinction between imagination and reality is effaced, as when something that we have hitherto regarded as imaginary appears before us in reality, or when a symbol takes over the full functions of the thing it symbolizes, and so on. It is this factor which contributes not a little to the uncanny effect attaching to magical practices. It is not difficult to recall instances in one’s childhood, Freud avers, when one has imagined inanimate objects, like toys (or animate ones, for that matter, such as a pet dog) to be capable of talking to you, but when it actually appears to happen (which would be a hallucination, as opposed to a deliberate imagining), it unavoidably produces an uncanny effect. One might expect the same thing to be the case with AI, whether in the shape of a computer or a robot, and ordinarily – perhaps at an earlier stage of AI development – this would probably have been the case. But today seems to be different: people, especially the young, have become so accustomed to interacting with computer software programmes, and recently with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, that what might have been an experience of the uncanny before is, for all intents and purposes, no longer the case. In this respect, the ‘uncanny’ appears to have been domesticated. As long ago as 2011, in Alone Together, Sherry Turkle reported that she was concerned about young people displaying an increasing tendency to prefer interacting with machines, rather than other human beings. Hence, it should not be in the least surprising that AI chatbots have assumed the guise of something ‘normal’ in the sphere of communication (leaving aside for the moment the question of the status of this vaunted ‘communication’). Furthermore – and here the fear of what AI could bring about on the part of all-too-trusting individuals raises its ugly head – from recent reports (such as this one) it is apparent that, particularly the young, are extremely susceptible to chatbots’ ‘advice’ and suggestions concerning their own actions, as Michael Snyder points out: Our kids are being targeted by AI chatbots on a massive scale, and most parents have no idea that this is happening. When you are young and impressionable, having someone tell you exactly what you want to hear can be highly appealing. AI chatbots have become extremely sophisticated, and millions of America’s teens are developing very deep relationships with them. Is this just harmless fun, or is it extremely dangerous? A brand new study that was just released by the Center for Democracy & Technology contains some statistics that absolutely shocked me… A new study published Oct. 8 by the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) found that 1 in 5 high school students have had a relationship with an AI chatbot, or know someone who has. In a 2025 report from Common Sense Media, 72% of teens had used an AI companion, and a third of teen users said they had chosen to discuss important or serious matters with AI companions instead of real people. We aren’t just talking about a few isolated cases anymore. At this stage, literally millions upon millions of America’s teens are having very significant relationships with AI chatbots. Unfortunately, there are many examples where these relationships are leading to tragic consequences. After 14-year-old Sewell Setzer developed a ‘romantic relationship’ with a chatbot on Character.AI, he decided to take his own life… As the preceding discussion shows, there are some areas of human activity where one need not fear AI, and then there are others where such fears are legitimate, sometimes because of the manner in which unscrupulous people harness AI against other people. But whatever the case may be, the best way to approach the tricky terrain regarding the capabilities of AI vis-á-vis humans is to remind oneself of the fact that – as argued at the outset in this article – AI depends on vast amounts of data to draw on, and on being ‘trained’ by programmers to do this. Humans do not.

Earlier today, Mikael Dolsten, who most recently served as the Head of R&D at Pfizer, informed Novo Nordisk that, in spite of his desire to join, he has decided to withdraw his candidacy to the Novo Nordisk Board of Directors, both as a member and as observer, due to recent personal circumstances unrelated to Novo Nordisk A/S and the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The Novo Nordisk Foundation and Novo Holdings A/S have informed Novo Nordisk that they will not propose the election of another candidate instead of Mikael Dolsten at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Instead, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and Novo Holdings A/S intend for the incoming Novo Nordisk Board of Directors to identify and nominate two candidates in addition to the already nominated Helena Saxon to the Board of Directors at Novo Nordisk’s Annual General Meeting on 26 March 2026. The other Board candidates standing for election at the 14 November 2025 extraordinary general meeting remain as announced in the 21 October 2025 convening notice.

Title: The Shutdown Is Over. Winter Is Usually Good For Stocks. Here's Why Investors Are Selling.

The stock market cleared a major hurdle this week. It's the outset of what is historically a good time for equities. You wouldn't know it if you looked at your portfolio today. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation to reopen the federal government, ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reopening removes the economic drag from more than 1 million federal workers going without pay and clears a path for federal agencies to once again release vital economic data. Yet stocks were falling Thursday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which finished the day down more than 2%—perhaps a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, since stocks rallied on Monday as an end to the shutdown looked imminent. AI optimism and expectations for rate cuts have been two of the primary drivers of stock returns this year. If either AI or the Federal Reserve fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, stocks may be vulnerable to correction. Historically, the end of a shutdown has supported stocks, according to Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist at LPL Financial. Since 1976, he wrote Wednesday, covering 20 shutdowns, the S&P 500 has risen more in the one- and three-month periods after a budget resolution than in all other comparable periods. This shutdown is also ending at a time of year that’s historically good for the stock market. Since 2000, November has, on average, been the best month of the year for the S&P 500. December, another positive month, is more often than not capped off with a Santa Claus rally. But the mood on Wall Street heading into the end of the year appears more dour than rosy, with investors debating the existence of an AI bubble and uncertain what incoming economic data will say about the health of the economy. The debate about an AI bubble has taken a toll on tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) slid 7% last week, and were down more than 3.5% on Thursday. Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.

Title: Verizon Eyes Layoff That May Cut 15,000 Jobs

Sources told The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that in the name of reducing costs, Verizon Communications plans to cut about 15,000 jobs within the coming week.

Δ According to the Thursday (Nov. 13) report, this would be the largest workforce reduction in the telecommunications giant’s history. In addition, 200 Verizon retail stores will be transitioned into franchised operations, sources said. This restructuring would remove the employees working at those locations from Verizon’s payroll. According to securities findings, as of February, Verizon had approximately 100,000 employees. As PYMNTS reported, the company appointed Dan Schulman as its CEO last month. Schulman, who previously held CEO roles at PayPal and Virgin Mobile USA, took over at Verizon as competition in the wireless and home internet markets continues to intensify. The largest U.S. telecommunications provider by subscriber base, Verizon is trying to offset the loss of postpaid phone subscribers for three consecutive quarters and a net loss of 7,000 postpaid phone connections in the latest quarter, WSJ said. Despite customer retention efforts, such as offering price-lock guarantees, competitors like AT&T and T-Mobile have continued to gain ground, the report said. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Pledging to cut costs and exit unprofitable legacy businesses aggressively, Schulman reportedly said in a call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, “We have a tremendous amount of opportunity to be more efficient, to be scrappier. Cost reductions will be a way of life for us here.” Verizon is not the only major company that’s downsizing to adapt to economic and technological shifts. As PYMNTS recently reported, Amazon has started cutting 30,000 jobs, UPS is rolling out buyouts and layoffs affecting 34,000 drivers and warehouse workers, and Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs. The WSJ report quoted analysts from Morgan Stanley as saying that improvements for Verizon’s operational and financial performance are “possible, if not probable,” if the company maintains a rational market approach. It’s going to take some time, though.

Amazon GamesCrystal DynamicsLayoffsTomb Raider Crystal Dynamics is undergoing another round of cuts. It revealed on Thursday that nearly 30 more developers would be laid off as the company restructures for the future. Specifically, it claimed the cuts were necessary to “optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game.” The Amazon Games-backed project was announced three years ago and still no official details have been shared, though Kotaku understands its development has been challenging as Crystal Dynamics tried to push the franchise in the direction of an open-world experience. The studio announced the layoffs on LinkedIn: Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams. As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition. To our players – as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future. We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team’s amazing new work with the world in the future. It’s the third round of layoffs this year and comes only months after cuts that were made due to the Microsoft’s cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was doing the bulk of development on. The Xbox stealth action game was reportedly almost revived under a new publisher, but the deal felt apart over IP rights. The studio has been part of Embracer Group since it was sold by Square Enix as part of a $300 million package back in 2022. Its publishing partner for Tomb Raider, Amazon Games, recently underwent its own mass layoffs and announced it was taking a step back from certain internally developed AAA games. Crystal Dynamics’ latest budgetary pressures could possible be the result of Amazon pulling back on the deal. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

A project of Common Dreams press@groundworkcollaborative.org Corporate executives are quietly acknowledging what millions of Americans already feel: Trump’s economy is squeezing lower- and middle-income families while corporations enjoy record profits and the wealthy continue to prosper. Consumer outlook indicators point in the same direction. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment declined across nearly every demographic group this November — by age, income, and political leaning — except for those with the largest stock portfolios, whose confidence jumped 11%. Similarly, consumer confidence data from the Conference Board showed that the confidence dropped among Americans earning under $75,000 and increased the most for those making more than $200,000 — a clear sign that everyday Americans are growing more worried about their finances, having to spend less just to stay afloat as the K-shaped economy deepens. Key Excerpts Food and Beverage Industry Scott Boatwright, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer and Director said during a Q3 2025 earnings call: “Earlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency across all income cohorts. Since then, the gap has widened, with low to middle-income guests further reducing frequency.” He continued to say, “The economists we have spoken to over the last several quarters, say, Q4, Q1 [are] likely to be the toughest for the consumer. Specifically the cohort under $100,000. A particularly challenged cohort is the 25- to 35-year-old age group [...] This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth.” Coca-Cola's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun stated during a Q3 2025 earnings call that “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups. The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there." Constellation Brands (Makers of Modello and Corona Beer) Chief Executive Officer William Newlands told attendees at the Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025 “The Hispanic consumer is very concerned at the moment. 80% are concerned about socioeconomic factors, 75% are concerned about their personal finances. It means that their shopping behavior has changed.” General Mills’ Group President of North America Retail & North America Pet Dana McNabb said during an Investor Day meeting that “the consumer is still adjusting to this once-in-a-lifetime inflationary period and trying to find their footing...they're stressed." General Mills’ CEO Jeffery Harmening followed up by noting that "the combination of the length of the inflation that we have seen and inflation is still running at or ahead of wage growth. And so consumers, if you're making $200,000 a year or less, you are really feeling that pinch even still today." Kraft-Heinz CEO and Director Carlos Abrams-Rivera laid it out on the Q3 2025 earning call saying that “fact that we have now one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades...it is a unique moment right now in which this is getting -- the consumer negativity and the sentiment is extending longer than we had originally expected." Jack Sinclair, CEO and director for grocery store chain Sprout's Farmers Market told shareholders on the Q3 2025 earnings Call that "from a consumer pressure perspective, I mean, I think that's building … a little bit more in the kind of lower and middle income is what you read about and what you hear. [...] middle-income trade areas, younger demographics … it's just a little more pronounced in those, but I think the pressure is there for everybody and everyone is trying to figure out how they manage through that in a dynamic environment.” Dirk Van de Put, the Chair and CEO of Mondelez (Makers of Oreo cookies, Halls cough drops, and Wheat Thins) said on a Q3 2025 earnings call that while their consumers are “very concerned in general about the economy, frustrated with the pricing they're seeing,” Mondelez’s seasonal products allow the company to charge higher prices because "the consumer is not that clear on what the right price point is and also is inclined to pay a little bit more." Travel Industry American Airlines' Chief Strategy Officer, Steve Johnson, said on a Q3 earnings call that “Nearly 50% of our ticket revenue comes from premium,” and as a result the airline is planning to add additional premium seats to its fleet. On an Q3 earnings call, Scott Kirby, United Airlines’ CEO described how economic stress causes demand to "bleed off on the lower end” making more seats available for brand loyal customers. The Groundwork Collaborative is dedicated to advancing a coherent and persuasive progressive economic worldview and narrative capable of delivering meaningful opportunity and prosperity for everyone. Our work is driven by a core guiding principle: We are the economy. Groundwork Collaborative envisions an economic system that produces strong, broadly shared prosperity and power for all people, not just a wealthy few. "None of this would have been possible without everyday New Yorkers willing to spare $5, $10, or $20 to help build a government that will deliver for working people," said the mayor-elect. Hundreds of people in New York City gathered on Sunday in Union Square with calls to "Tax the Rich" as they showed their support for the progressive agenda of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist elected earlier this month who will take the helm of the nation's largest city on January 1. The "Tax the Rich — Seize Our Future" event was co-sponsored by the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialist of America, Housing Justice For All and NYS Tenant Bloc, Jewish Voice for Peace NYC, UAW Region 9A, the Invest in Our New Coalition, and others. "Healthcare is becoming unsustainable under Trump," says one progressive politician running for US Senate. "Medicare for All would fix it." The Trump administration came under fire on Sunday after sending Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, onto CNN's weekend news show to try to explain the Republican Party's elusive "solution" to the nation's healthcare crisis, a topic of much interest in recent weeks amid the longest government shutdown in the nation's history and growing fears over massive premium increases or loss of coverage for tens millions of Americans. Asked during his appearance to explain what Republicans are considering to address the surging cost of healthcare, Oz talked about direct cash payments—something Trump himself has floated in recent weeks—as well as the idea of health saving accounts (or HSAs) which allow for personalized accounts set up to help pay for out-of-pocket medical needs, though not premium payments. "It is time to put these old fuels where they belong—in the ground of history.” An estimated 50,000 people took to the streets of Belém do Pará, Brazil, on Saturday to demonstrate outside the halls of the United Nations annual climate summit, holding a "Great People's March" and makeshift "Funeral for Fossil Fuels" as they demanded a just transition toward a more renewable energy system and egalitarian economy. Organized by civil society organizations and Indigenous Peoples groups from Brazil and beyond, the tens of thousands who marched outside the thirtieth Conference of the Parties (COP30) summit called for an end to the rapacious greed of the oil, gas, and coal companies as they advocated for big polluters to pay for the large-scale damage their businesses have caused worldwide over the last century.

Title: As Trump Drives Up Costs, Record Share of Subprime Auto Loans Overdue

An advertisement for easy financing is posted on the front window of a used car lot on September 6, 2023 in San Pablo, California. "The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," said one finance professor. Last month's jobs report may never be released after being delayed during the federal government shutdown, but other figures demonstrate the havoc President Donald Trump is wreaking on the US economy, including new data for subprime borrowers behind on car payments. The share of US borrowers with low credit scores or limited credit histories who are at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest percentage since Fitch Ratings began tracking it in the early 1990s. "The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," Massachusetts Institute of Technology finance professor Christopher Palmer told Marketplace on Wednesday in response to the new data. As Bloomberg reported Wednesday: Fitch's findings on missed car payments notably follow two key disruptions in the auto lending space. "PrimaLend, which serves the 'buy-here-pay-here' auto financing market—where dealers sell and directly finance vehicles for customers with poor or limited credit—filed for bankruptcy protection last month," Reuters reported. "Tricolor, which sold cars and provided auto loans mostly to low-income Hispanic communities in the Southwestern United States, also filed for bankruptcy in September." In mid-October, the credit score model development company VantageScore released an analysis showing that auto loans "have now evolved from being one of the least risky consumer credit products to one of the loan types most prone to delinquencies," as consumers struggle with rising interest rates, financing costs, and prices of cars, insurance, and repairs. "Auto loans have not followed the trends of other credit products as delinquencies have been persistently trending up across all credit tiers and income groups over the past 15 years," said VantageScore's chief economist and strategy officer, Rikard Bandebo, in a statement. "Even after the industry tightened lending criteria three years ago, delinquencies have continued to rise." A few days before the VantageScore analysis, Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book announced that in September, the average transaction price (ATP) of a new vehicle in the US had soared above $50,000 for the first time. "It is important to remember that the new vehicle market is inflationary. Prices go up over time, and today's market is certainly reminding us of that," said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating last month. "The $20,000 vehicle is now mostly extinct, and many price-conscious buyers are sidelined or cruising in the used vehicle market. Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates, and are propping up the higher end of the market." "Tariffs have introduced new cost pressure to the business, but the pricing story in September was mostly driven by the healthy mix of EVs and higher-end vehicles pushing the new vehicle ATP into uncharted territory," she added. "We've been expecting to break through the $50,000 barrier. It was only a matter of time, especially when you consider the bestselling vehicle in America is a pickup truck from Ford that routinely costs north of $65,000. That's today's market, and it is ripe for disruption." Other recent findings that have shown the economic deterioration under Trump include a Thursday report from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which found that the average US family is spending around $700 more each month on basic items since Trump returned to office in January. "As families across the country spend more to pay their bills and put food on the table, Democrats and Republicans should be working together to lower costs," said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), the JEC’s ranking member. "Instead, President Trump is pushing ahead with reckless tariffs that continue to fuel inflation and drive prices up even higher." A closely watched University of Michigan survey revealed last week that since October, consumer sentiment has fallen over 6% to 50.3, the second-lowest level since 1978, and the "current economic conditions" index has dropped nearly 11% to an all-time low of 52.3. Earlier in November, the Washington Post reported on layoff data from corporate outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which documented 153,000 job cuts in October, bringing the total for this year to 1.1 million. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009," said the firm's CEO, John Challenger. "When you see companies making cuts of this size, it does signal a real shift in direction."

Title: Verizon layoffs: American telecommunications company to cut 15,000 jobs amid restructuring — Who will get affected?

Verizon layoffs: Verizon, the leading American telecommunications company, is set to reduce thousands of roles as part of a restructuring under its new CEO Dan Schulman, reported Reuters. The company is planning to cut about 15,000 jobs, 15% of its workforce, said the report, citing person familiar with the matter. However, a Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The new CEO's first commitment was to stop the bleeding from subscriber churn, which would require subsidizing expensive handsets for a huge number of Verizon's subscribers to keep them from leaving, Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, told Reuters. The layoffs are set to take place as soon as next week. The job cuts are aimed at Verizon's non-union management ranks and are expected to affect more than 20% of that workforce, a source told Reuters. He added that Verizon also plans to transition around 180 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations. As subscriber growth slows and cautious consumers are unwilling to buy premium wireless plans, Verizon is battling rising competition. The coompany is also facing mounting pressure from rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US. At the end of 2024, Verizon had about 1,00,000 US employees. Last year it announced a reduction of 4,800 employees through a voluntary program and took a nearly $2 billion charge. — Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless C-Band spectrum in a 2021 auction. — The telecommunication company struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year. — Verizon also spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless. Amazon, TCS, Microsoft, IBM and several other companies have announced layoffs. Earlier this month, tech giant IBM said that it would cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” said the company's spokesperson. According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs — over 110,502 tech workers have been laid off across 226 tech companies in 2025 alone. Amazon has announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people. The total workforce of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest IT services firm, reduced to 593,314 after the count dropped by 19,755, as of the second quarter of the financial year 2025-26.

Agentic calling, 'Buy for me,' and shop with Gemini. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's the holiday season, and Google is rolling out some epic tools to help you find the perfect holiday gift, but here's the catch — with Gemini, so that you don't have to jump several hoops to find that one thing you spotted on social media or that a friend recently wore. Google is making AI Mode do the heavy lifting for you, so users can go beyond simple two-line queries and really get into the details when describing the product they need. Users can now have conversations with AI Mode in Search, much like they would with a store employee in person, describing exactly what they're looking for instead of typing several lines. When you ask AI Mode a shopping question, you’ll not only get results to your search query, but it will also give you the images along with a breakdown of other purchasing details like price, reviews, and inventory info, helping users "quickly and confidently decide what to buy." For instance, if you need some visual inspiration, you can simply say “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors,” and you’ll see shoppable images. By simply asking for "moisturizers suited to your skin type," you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences. Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot. The feature pops up when users ask a shopping-related query. Google says it will give you shopping inspiration for events like Black Friday or holiday lists, providing shoppable product listings, comparison tables, and more. Google's Agentic AI can now find products in stock nearby, saving you the hassle of calling multiple stores and wasting your time being on hold. When you search for products "near me" on Google Search, select "Let Google Call." AI will then call local stores on your behalf to check availability, price, and promos. You'll receive an email or text with the answers, including local inventory from the Shopping Graph. The tech giant says that this feature uses Duplex technology, "with a big Gemini model upgrade that helps us identify the best stores to call, suggest helpful questions to ask based on the product you want and summarize the conversations into key takeaways." Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Holiday sales can be totally overwhelming with so many stores offering huge discounts, and between all that craziness, it's easy to miss out on that dress you've been wanting forever or those pair of shoes that are only on sale for a few days. But that could change, as Google's new "agentic checkout" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget. So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants. If that wasn't enough, Google will then purchase it for you on the merchant's site using Google Pay, obviously after taking necessary permissions from you. This feature combines Gemini models and the Shopping Graph, saving you time and money this holiday season. These agentic shopping features are available in the U.S. starting today (Nov. 13), and Google says it has plans to roll them out to other countries soon.

Title: Deals: M4 MacBook Air $250 off, entry M5 MacBook Pro all-time low, Apple Watch SE 3 $200/Ultra 3 $99 off, more

Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
Today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break is loaded with some big-time Apple price drops. Firstly, the all-time lows at $250 off across the M4 MacBook Air lineup have now returned, and we are now tracking a new Amazon all-time low on the most affordable M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Those offers also join the best prices to date on Apple Watch Ultra 3 Alpine and Trail configs as well as all-time low pricing on the most affordable new Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 at $200. All of that is detailed for you below alongside this $300 price drop Apple’s Space Black 1TB M4 iPad Pro cell model. Deals on Apple’s latest MacBook releases are really starting to heat up as part of the early Black Friday festivities. All of the M4 MacBook Air models have now dropped back down to the lowest prices ever, we caught an upgraded M5 MacBook Pro at a new all-time low yesterday, and Amazon just served up the lowest price to date on the most affordable new M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Amazon is now offering the 14-inch Space Black M5 MacBook Prowith 16GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,481 shipped. Regularly $1,599, this is a new Amazon all-time low and the best price we have tracked yet in new condition with $118 slashed from the list. We recently featured a series of exclusive discounts on Apple’s brand new M5 machine – most of those offers remain the lowest prices we have seen to date, but Amazon has now picked it up a notch to deliver the lowest prices anywhere on the new 16GB models, including both the 512GB and 1TB storage options: We caught some early and quite impressive $99 price drops on the brand new Apple Watch Ultra 3 as part of the major early Black Friday offers. At the time that was largely just for Costco members or only on the new Ocean Band configurations elsewhere, but this morning Amazon has put a number of the Alpine and Trail Loop at $99 off as well. Amazon is still offering the same price drops we featured previously on the Ocean Band models, but you will now find a selection of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 configswith the new 2025 Alpine Loop and Trail Loops marked down to $699.99 shipped – a new Amazon all-time low price at $99 under the regular $799 list price. As you can see in the list above, we are also adding the Natural Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the matching Natural Titanium Milanese Loop to the list as well. This one, as you likely already know, fetches a premium because of the higher-end metal Milanese Loop, but it is also now $99 off and sitting at the best price we have ever tracked on Amazon. While not a perfect comparison because it was effectively just a new black color last year, the best official deal we tracked on Apple Watch Ultra 2 (currently down at $650) for Black Friday 2024 was the $80 price drop ushered in by Best Buy’s Black Friday Doorbusters and over at Amazon. We could see the series 3 go for less, but landing Apple’s brand new flagship wearable at nearly $100 off is certainly a solid price drop this soon after release. We caught our very first deal on Apple’s new Midnight 44mm Midnight SE 3 wearable the other day. It went completely out of stock before making a return yesterday – it is still live at the moment – and now the most affordable Midnight model in the new collection is live at its $199.99 all-time low. Amazon is now offering the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 in the Midnight colorway down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $249, this is nearly $49 off and the best price we have ever tracked. While this one did drop to the same $200 we have here now at a few days ago, it almost immediately went out of stock and remained unavailable until this morning. Considering almost no one had a chance at this deal earlier in the week, today’s offer is effectively the first chance to score a notable price drop on the most affordable Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 – the most affordable 2025 Apple Watch – and a new Amazon all-time low. This year’s new Apple Watch SE model is the most compelling model Apple has ever released if you ask me. It is, by and large, for just about anyone but the most hardcore users, effectively an Apple Watch Series 10 with less color options. It runs on the same S10 chip and finally supports an always-on display (a must-have for me) as well as double-tap and wrist-flick gesture support. It’s clearly not a Series-grade Apple Watch, but starting at $200 it’s awfully close and much more affordable – the most affordable Series 11 starts at $389 on Amazon. Amazon is landing this morning with one of the best discounts we have ever tracked on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While we have seen a countless number of opportunities to save big on iPhone 16 Pro configurations, particularly deep 16 Pro Max offers have been a little bit harder to come by. However, this morning you’ll find the 1TB Black Titanium model at $540 off the original list price. Amazon is now offering the Black Titanium 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max down at $1,059 shipped in Renewed Premium condition with a 1-year warranty and a 90-day return guarantee. You’re looking at a spec’d out, upgraded iPhone 16 Pro Max that released in late 2024 at $1,599. While Apple no longer sells this model, as it has been replaced by the 17 Pro Max for the same price, this is indeed $540 off the price you would have paid for it straight from Apple not more than a couple months ago. And all things considered, if it has taken this long for Amazon to serve up an all-time low price on the 16 Pro, you might be waiting until this time next year to see the same on the 17 Pro/Max. The $1,059 asking price here might seem like a lot for a renewed iPhone, but this is the highest-quality refurb Amazon offers and one of the best sources for relatively new iPhone deals there is. I might even suggest it is the best way to land an unlocked iPhone 16 Pro/Max anywhere, even if you have the cash to buy a brand new unit. For more insight on what Apple’s latest handset releases deliver, here’s our hands-on review of the new iPhone 17 Pro. With all of the new M5 talk and fancy new Apple Watch releases, and the all-new AirPods Pro 3, never mind the all-time low pricing on M4 MacBook Air models, one of the best and most value-packed current-generation machines might be slipping under your radar – M4 Mac mini. I have been raving about this machine for a long while now, and with early Black Friday pricing now live, and our recent follow-up video review after 1 year in the lab, we wanted to make sure these deals are front and center. There’s no denying how convenient a MacBook can be – it is effectively just as good a home office computer as it is a portable solution – but it’s going to cost you a whole lot more than the Mac mini. And while I certainly value the freedom Apple’s battery-powered Macs provide, the M4 Mac mini has been the best and most useful Apple purchase I have made in recent memory. If you need to be able to pick up and go with your Mac system, then the Mac mini clearly isn’t for you, but if you don’t or you’re just looking to land a solid new at-home setup without completely running up the credit card, there’s simply nothing better if you ask me. You can get the same on-screen macOS experience as the MacBook for $250 less than the most affordable current-generation MacBook, and that’s with the all-time low Black Friday pricing right now.

Title: ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry deregisters Scion hedge fund amid bets against AI titans
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/business/big-short-investor-michael-burry-deregisters-scion-hedge-fund-amid-bets-against-ai-titans/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:32:20Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry, the investor whose successful bets against the US housing market in 2008 were recounted in the movie “The Big Short,” is closing his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management. In a letter to investors dated Oct. 27, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Burry said he would liquidate the funds and return capital, “but for a small audit/tax holdback” by the end of the year. A person directly familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the letter. “My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets,” Burry said in the letter. Burry could not be immediately reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s database showed Scion’s registration status as “terminated” as of Nov. 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state. Investment funds that manage more than $100 million of capital are required to register with the SEC. Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth. In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, “On to much better things Nov 25th.” Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burry, who was famously featured in the book and movie ‘The Big Short’, has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments. In his post on X, Burry said he spent about $9.2 million buying up about 50,000 put options on Palantir, saying that the options would allow him to sell the stock at $50 apiece in 2027. The put options convey the right to sell shares at a set price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view. Palantir’s shares were trading at $178.29 on Thursday, giving the company a market value of $422.36 billion. So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD Last month, Burry posted an image of his character from ‘The Big Short’ movie and warned of bubbles, saying that, “Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.” “Burry’s decision feels less like ‘calling it quits’ and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Burry, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated. AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of the S&P 500 index’s returns since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, JPMorgan Asset Management wrote in September. “Don’t count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital,” said Schneller. The investor’s short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Big Short,” and its film adaptation. His profile on X, titled “Cassandra Unchained,” is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe. Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation. Burry’s Scion ended last year with shares in American Coastal, Bruker, Canada Goose, HCA Healthcare, Magnera, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health and VF Corp, but the firm ended those bets earlier this year. During the quarter ended June 30, Burry’s Scion Asset Management was more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs. Burry, who launched Scion Asset Management in 2013, joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors. Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India’s Adani Group and electric-truck maker Nikola. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company’s bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor’s bitcoin holding company Strategy. Chanos has argued that Strategy’s valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor. Advertisement

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And we’ve found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to our forecasting approach.Iteration by iteration, my skepticism has turned to light distrust, and then into actually getting value out of our company forecasts. Like most AI companies, we draw from improvements against our LLM-agent benchmarks, Deep Research Bench and Bench to the Future.But at the end of the day, to evaluate it, I think it’s best to follow Charlie Munger’s advice: try to disprove what Stockfisher says. Now, even after an hour of carefully reading through a stock, I generally can’t find any major flaws, and I hear the same from other serious investors.And, since it’s software, not human analysis, we applied it at scale. We have long-term forecasts for revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500.We do a Buffett-style intrinsic valuation, that doesn’t take the stock price into account. This means you can sort by the difference between what the stock market says, and what Stockfisher says. Some very interesting neglected companies rise to the top, and we’re starting to process the mid-caps and small-caps too.Stockfisher is live at https://platform.stockfisher.app, no sign in required, to see what we have on the top stocks. (I was happy to see Alphabet comes out well. Meta looks good too, but Amazon and Apple do not.) I would love for you to judge for yourself if the quality of analysis is up to your standards.

But they do get certain things right. And if you figure out the patterns of what types of manager promises tend to play out, and assess them individually for their reliability, you can reason about these business model changes decently well. reply reply The most interesting aspect of this is backtesting. Quant models get run on past data to see if their predictions work.When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world. And then there's the fact that they do their research on the open internet. It makes backtesting hard - but not impossible.We wrote about how we do our pastcasting validation here: https://stockfisher.app/backtesting-forecasts-that-use-llms When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world.

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3,188.42, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$140.56, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock. A DAT’s share price reflects not just the value of its crypto treasury but also investor sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Advisors should review three things: Advisors can then reframe client enthusiasm around fundamentals. Is the goal diversified exposure or speculation on a premium? That distinction determines whether a DAT belongs anywhere near a client’s portfolio. Q: What should advisors be ready to explain when clients compare DATs to spot ETFs? A: This will be the most common question. The answer is that spot ETFs hold the digital asset directly, trade close to net asset value, and operate under clear regulation. DATs, on the other hand, are companies using corporate balance sheets to hold those same assets and sometimes using debt to do it. That means the potential upside can look exciting, but the risk profile is closer to a leveraged stock than an ETF. Advisors should prepare to discuss taxation, concentration risk, and how DATs might react differently from the underlying crypto. Helping clients see that difference turns a speculative headline into a teachable moment about structure, liquidity, and risk tolerance. - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You CoinDesk 20 Performance Update: AAVE Falls 7.8%, Leading Index Lower Uniswap (UNI) was also among the underperformers, declining 5.5% from Thursday.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Is Retiring up 595%, but She’s Still Holding on to These 3 Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history. Since mid-2014, her strategy has yielded her 858.58% in gains, whereas the S&P 500 only returned 263.2%. This is a 595% outperformance over the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the three stocks she holds now. Nvidia is Pelosi’s biggest holding, with 20% of her portfolio being in this one stock. Her latest trade was on January 14, 2025, and was disclosed on January 17. She purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $80 and an expiration date of January 16, 2026. Since that trade, NVDA stock is up 47.09%. If the options were to be exercised today, she would have a total of $569,000 in NVDA stock. To find the true profits, you’d have to exclude the premium paid for all these options, the exact amount of which is not known. Alphabet is her second-biggest holding, with 15% of her portfolio in GOOGL stock. Her latest transaction was on January 14, 2025, and was filed three days later on January 17. She bought 50 call options on GOOGL stock, with each option representing 100 shares. This has been a very profitable buy, with GOOGL stock up more than 46% since that transaction took place. Since these are options, Pelosi will be able to exercise 5,000 shares of GOOGL at the strike price of $150. If these options were to be exercised today, she would have $683,550 in GOOGL stock. This is a well-timed trade, and Pelosi is very likely to exercise these options by the time they expire and then hold GOOGL stock directly. Broadcom also has the same weight as Alphabet at 15%. Her most recent AVGO trade happened on June 20, 2025, and it was disclosed on July 9. She exercised 20 call options that were purchased on June 24, 2024 (20,000 shares post-split). President Donald Trump announced a $70 billion investment in AI and energy, less than a month after Pelosi exercised those options. AVGO stock is up 42.09% since the call options were exercised, but her initial call options trade made even more money. Pelosi bought 20 call options on AVGO with an $800 strike price and an expiry of June 20, 2025. This was three weeks before AVGO went through a 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock gained over 50% from June 24, 2024, to June 20, 2025.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history.

Title: This is how MAGA falls

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye As in his first term, Donald Trump now presides over a visibly sinking ship as his approval ratings slide. MAGA, a movement built around the personality of one man, never amounted to a coherent political force or even a workable coalition. Claims that Trump and his lieutenants won a mandate in 2024 and then ‘saved’ the country were always delusional. After all, his margin was thin, as was that of his party in Congress. Three forces are killing MAGA, perhaps even pushing the US in a distinctly socialist direction. The first are the internal divisions, which are growing ever-more pronounced and will only intensify as an aging Trump becomes an ever-lamer duck, particularly if Democrats romp to victory again in the 2026 midterms. The second, arguably more serious, weakness lies in the loss of the Latino vote – a growing political force in many states. Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President. Unfortunately, there's a good chance a Democrat President will be taking credit for those jobs. 1 posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye There isn’t going to be any 2026 Mid-term!

Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America.

Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground.

New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter.

The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats.

New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues.

History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Title: Don't Chase Google, Meta: IBM Chief Scientist Urges Graduates To Examine Sectors Outside Silicon Valley
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/dont-chase-google-meta-ibm-chief-scientist-urges-graduates-to-examine-sectors-outside-silicon-valley

IBM Chief Scientist Ruchir Puri urged tech graduates to explore avenues beyond chasing after the prestige of Silicon Valley tech giants such as Google, Meta or Microsoft. He encouraged them to instead look into those sectors and industries where they find potential for innovation, in light of the turbulence in the job market primarily stemming from AI. "Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after," Puri said, indicating that software engineers have niches they can thrive in beyond large tech companies. "Artificial intelligence is transforming every sector — from agriculture to retail — and meaningful work is happening everywhere," he said in an interview with Business Today. Puri used the example of agricultural manufacturing company John Deere which have used AI and automation to optimise its operations in innovative ways. The firm has pioneered ecofriendly and economical ways to engage in weeding, such as the 'spot and spray' method, where cameras and AI are used to find and target individual weeds, helping farmer cut costs and reduce damage to crops. “Graduates often overlook such enterprises while focusing narrowly on Silicon Valley,” Puri said. He asked freshers to see beyond "a narrow set of tech companies" and to look to the "massive enterprise landscape". His comments can also be contextualised with the increasing number of lay-offs and lower job demand in tech companies with the advent of AI automation. Job postings reduced 16% year-over-year, according to an August report from Handshake, at the same time, applications per posting went up 26% showing the gap between demand and supply. Tech conglomerates such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Amazon have announced waves of layoffs in 2025. IBM also stated earlier in the month that it would get rid of thousands of positions across the globe in the fourth quarter. However the firm also said that its planning to ramp up hiring young graduates for AI-centred positions, according statements chief executive officer Arvidn Krishna made to CNN in an interview. “People are talking about layoffs or hiring freezes, but I actually want to say we are the opposite,” Krishna said. “We expect to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in recent years," he added.

Title: As industry layoffs become the ‘new normal’, so does fear of AI’s impact on adland’s job market

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Job cuts made at Brandtech group media agency Jellyfish may be the latest symptom of a contracting advertising and marketing job market. The company cut as many as 50 roles at the end of October, following a slowdown in client spending, Digiday has learned. “Our existing clients were spending less money, some of those were retracting the projects that they had planned, and that obviously led to a revenue hit,” said one exec whose role was cut in the layoffs and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jellyfish confirmed the cuts. “Like everyone in marketing, our business is dynamic and we are constantly making shifts in our resources, redesigning roles and structures,” said a spokesperson. “At 8% we have one of the lowest churn rates in the industry. Currently there is a very small number of roles affected in the U.S. and U.K.” Those let go face difficult circumstances. One ad-tech executive made redundant earlier this year, who exchanged candor for anonymity, told Digiday that 11 months on, they were still without a permanent position. Compared with previous job markets, they said new positions were thinner on the ground. “Back then I could walk out of a job and walk into five interviews the following day. Now, I can’t get the interview,” they said. “It’s a tough market.” Jellyfish’s cuts are small, compared with the job losses at holding company agencies in recent months. Forrester analysis suggests agency headcounts have fallen 8% in 2025. In August, Dentsu committed to eliminating 3,400 jobs worldwide, approximately 8% of its staff. WPP, meanwhile, cut 7,000 during the final months of Mark Read’s CEO tenure; 700 came from Ogilvy alone. Interpublic Group has laid off 3,200 employees this year, while its to-be acquirer Omnicom already cut its global headcount by 3,000 jobs in 2024 and has been working to reduce staff costs by 10% in the run-up to that merger’s completion. Once the deal is complete, it expects to find $750 million in cost savings — given labor costs always lead the balance sheet, that’s not great news for the thousands working under each umbrella. “Layoffs have become the new normal,” said the former Jellyfish exec. But industry job losses aren’t limited to agencies. In October, TikTok cut 400 jobs in the U.K. from its Trust and Safety Team, while Target cut 1,800 white-collar positions, and Amazon recently announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 roles. CPG giant Nestlé plans to cut 12,000 office staff. Between August and December 2024 (the most recent data), the American ad industry lost 4,600 roles overall according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And data from Britain’s Office for National Statistics showed job openings in the advertising and marketing industries had fallen 7.5% between 2022 and 2025. That’s set against rising unemployment in the U.S. (4.3% in August) and the U.K. (5% in September); U.S. firms, particularly retailers, announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some of the firms responsible have laid out their own justifications for reducing headcount. A historic merger here; long-term underperformance there; a restructuring ahead of a potential sale. Add them all together, and a pattern emerges. “What we’re seeing is layoffs as a result of restructuring and financial distress,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, who referenced an estimate by Madison & Wall that suggested the four largest holdcos averaged just 0.3% organic growth in Q3, the lowest for five years. “If you’ve got a category that is in effect growing less than 1% then yes, they’re shedding jobs, because jobs are the number one overhead,” he added. This year’s job cuts can be traced to restructuring and client cutbacks. But generative AI is the ghost at the leaving party. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” said Beth Galetti, svp of people experience and technology at Amazon, in an Oct. 28 blog post sent to Amazon employees. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Naveen Tewari, CEO of ad tech firm InMobi, warned in February that AI progress meant his software engineers “will not have jobs within two years.” Statements like Tewari’s are leaving marketing execs looking for their next role worried they’re going to be frozen out, experience be damned. The anonymous ad tech exec voiced fears that older workers could be disproportionately affected, and that a perception they’re less adept with gen AI tools could be used as cover for ageist discrimination. 40% of advertising staffers aged between 40 and 55 feel their age has limited their career, according to research by the IPA and the Advertising Association. “It does start to feel like ageism and a slight white male-ism,” they said. Pattisall suggested that while this year’s layoffs can be primarily traced to restructuring pushes, next year’s will be provoked by AI. Two years ago, Forrester predicted that AI, automation and efficiency initiatives would result in a net 7.5% reduction in the U.S. advertising workforce. Its most recent report upgraded that estimate to 15% by the end of next year. Again, this isn’t limited to ad agencies. Over a quarter of private-sector employers expect to cut staff as a result of AI, according to a survey of 2,000 firms by the Chartered Institue of Personnel and Development, the U.K. professional body for HR. 62% said they believed that admin and managerial roles were most at risk. “The technology was nascent when we developed that forecast in in mid-2023,” explained Pattisall. “We had not factored for agentic and agents. I think we’ll see a larger percentage of the advertising population that can be replaced by those tools.” — Jessica Davies contributed reporting to this story Walmart’s website says its meal costs 25% less than the basket it offered last year, and that the turkey was at the lowest price since 2019. Google is pushing Demand Gen and YouTube to ad partners, hedging against the inevitable erosion of its search business by AI chatbots. The arrival of the Agentic RTB Framework this week lands as this week lands as the third agentic standard in under a month.

by Michael Snyder | Nov 12, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second-lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: AMD Eyes Trillion-Dollar AI Chip Market

Exciting news for investors! Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced ambitious growth projections for its data center business. The company forecasts a potential $100 billion in annual revenue from data center chips within the next five years, accompanied by a threefold increase in profits. The Santa Clara, California-based chip design company saw its stock initially dip by 2.7% to $237.52 after market close, but quickly rebounded with a 4% increase in volatile trading as markets opened. This positive momentum builds upon a 16% increase in AMD’s share price since October 6th. This rise coincided with AMD securing a multi-year agreement with OpenAI, a deal expected to generate tens of billions of dollars annually. While this agreement may not immediately challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market, it signals growing confidence in AMD’s chip technology. The company’s optimistic financial outlook, revealed on Tuesday, is anticipated to alleviate investor concerns. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the data center chip market is expected to reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2030. She shared this forecast at an analyst day event in New York, highlighting the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving this growth. The market includes AMD’s general-purpose processors, networking chips, and specialized AI chips. “This is a very exciting market,” Su stated. “The data center is the largest growth opportunity right now, and AMD is incredibly well positioned for it.” Over the next three to five years, AMD projects an annual growth rate of 35% for its overall business, with a remarkable 60% growth rate specifically for its data center business, as announced by AMD’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean Hu. The company is targeting earnings per share of up to $20 within this timeframe. For context, Reuters cited an LSEG estimate predicting AMD’s 2025 profit at $2.68 per share. The future looks bright for AMD in the high-performance computing and artificial intelligence landscape. Nep123.com is your reliable source for news, stories, and insights from Nepal.

Title: In America’s K-Shaped Economy, The Rich Are Getting Richer While Almost Everyone Else Is Getting The Sharp End Of The Stick

Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Pundits have been talking a lot about America’s “K-shaped economy” lately, but most average people on the street have no idea what that means. Basically, it means that the wealthy are getting even wealthier while almost everyone else is getting monkey-hammered. Yesterday, I detailed 11 signs that economic conditions in the U.S. are the worst that they have been since the Great Recession, but if you have plenty of money you may feel like everything is just great right now. For those at the top of the economic pyramid, it could be argued that these are the best of times because the stock market has been soaring. But for many of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, it literally feels like we are in the midst of a horrifying economic crisis. At a time when the cost of living is crushing most of the population, debt levels are exploding, and mass layoffs are happening all over the nation, we continue to see “strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans”… Experts describe the current U.S. economy as “K-shaped,” a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the “K” represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans. By contrast, the letter’s lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs. The top 10 percent of all income earners have always spent more money than everyone else. But now the proportion of consumer spending that they are accounting for has reached the highest level ever recorded… These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi. “That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it’s ever been in the data,” he told CBS News. If you are thriving in this very difficult economic environment, that is a good thing. However, you should also be aware that most people are really struggling, and that is especially true for low-income Americans. In fact, the percentage of subprime borrowers that are “at least 60 days past due on their auto loans” just shot up to the highest level we have ever seen… More Americans than ever are falling behind on their car payments. The share of subprime borrowers at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest in data going back to 1994, according to Fitch Ratings. With ongoing inflation pressures and the return of student loan bills, millions of car owners are struggling to afford their monthly payments. It’s the latest sign of weakness in the US economy as the Federal Reserve considers the path of future rate cuts. We never even got a number this bad during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. As a result, vehicle repossessions are absolutely soaring. This is the economic reality that most of us are living in. According to one recent survey, 55 percent of American workers are concerned that they could soon lose their jobs… Some 55% of employed Americans say they’re concerned about losing their jobs, according to a recent Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That angst follows a drumbeat of layoff announcements by major employers, including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. calculated the most job cut announcements for any October in more than two decades. It comes layered on top of households’ exasperation over the cost of living. A 62% majority in the Oct. 23-25 poll said the cost of their everyday items had climbed over the last month and nearly half of those people said the increases have been difficult to afford. In previous recessions, low paid workers got laid off in very high numbers. This time around, it is highly paid workers that are getting hit particularly hard. Even highly successful tech companies such as Amazon are eliminating good paying jobs… Amazon is laying off almost 700 corporate workers based in New York City as part of the company’s nearly 14,000 corporate layoffs. The layoffs, which were first reported by Crain’s New York, were disclosed in a filing with the New York State Department of Labor. In total, 660 employees are being laid off by Amazon across nine offices in New York City. Among them, the largest layoffs affect Amazon’s Manhattan West office and its New York Tech Hub, also based in Manhattan. It appears that the employment market is really starting to deteriorate. And the most recent weekly report from ADP seems to confirm this… Recent announcements of large layoffs at a few prominent companies have raised concerns that the labor market could be weakening further, and today’s new weekly ADP employment report confirms that fear. The ADP weekly jobless report pointed to a deterioration in US labor momentum, stating that “for the four weeks ending Oct. 25, 2025, private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs a week, suggesting that the labor market struggled to produce jobs consistently during the second half of the month.” Added together that is 45,000 job losses in the month (not including government workers), which would be the largest monthly drop in jobs since March 2023… But if you have lots of cash in the bank and you are not concerned about the security of your job, you might be feeling pretty good right about now. As Peter Atwater has aptly noted, those that are sitting at the top are “spending like there’s no tomorrow”… Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts, said that the biggest division is America is not on the left and right, it’s up and down between those at the top and bottom of the US economy. For those at the top, the economy looks good and they are ‘spending like there’s no tomorrow.’ But Atwater says Americans on the bottom are already facing recession conditions, as people struggle with affordability. Of course the prosperity that high earners are currently experiencing is just temporary. Anyone that thinks that this stock market bubble is sustainable is simply not being rational. Key ratios were not even this out of whack during the most euphoric days of the Dotcom bubble. What goes up must come down. But for now the wealthy are living the high life while most of the rest of us really struggle to make ends meet from month to month.

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Are Almost Here. Investors Are Already Worried About the AI Rally.
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/ai-stocks-are-on-shaky-footing-heading-into-nvidia-earnings-nvda-stock-11848221

Full Content:
Nvidia is slated to report quarterly results next Wednesday. It could be a make-or-break moment for the bull market. Anxiety about AI is running high on Wall Street heading into Nvidia's (NVDA) print. AI stocks weighed on the broader market last week, when the Nasdaq notched its worst weekly performance since early April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement roiled markets. The mood improved to start the week amid signs that the government was moving closer to reopening. But AI jitters returned after Japanese investment firm SoftBank on Tuesday said it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia: Shares of both companies slumped despite SoftBank executives clarifying that the sale was made to fund other AI investments, not a sign that the company had soured on the chipmaker. Nvidia's quarterly earnings report is one of the most closely followed events on Wall Street. Investors parse Nvidia's results and guidance for confirmation that the AI infrastructure buildout, which made the chipmaker the world's most valuable company and has help power partners' and competitors' shares higher, is continuing. Some investors are increasingly concerned that an AI bubble is forming, fueled by a series of circular business deals, massive AI investments, and optimism about the technology’s near-term commercial utility. Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, recently revealed his hedge fund had shorted $1.2 billion of Nvidia and Palantir (PLTR) stock as of the end of September. The major hyperscalers—tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year and next as they construct data centers and outfit them with the advanced chips and support equipment required the train and run artificial intelligence. That spending has been a boon to companies like Nvidia, whose sales and earnings have soared over the past three years. But some investors question whether the hyperscalers would recoup their investments. BCA Research analysts last week suggested shorting hyperscaler stocks, citing their belief that the speed and scale of AI investments will weigh the companies' returns on equity, and thus their stock valuations, regardless of profit growth in their core businesses. “Our biggest fear would be a repeat of the telecom and fiber buildout experiences, where the revenue curve failed to materialize at a pace that justified continued investment,” wrote JPMorgan analysts on Wednesday. JPMorgan estimated that it would require about $650 billion of annual revenue indefinitely for tech companies to reap a 10% return on their AI investments through 2030. For scale, they likened that figure to nearly six basis points of global gross domestic product or nearly $35 a month from every current iPhone user. The growing importance of OpenAI to the rally has also raised eyebrows. According to CEO Sam Altman, the start-up recently reached an annualized revenue run rate of $20 billion. But JPMorgan estimates the ChatGPT maker has agreed to pay just three companies—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO)—between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion for data center capacity over the next 5 years. To be sure, many investors see ample reason to remain bullish on AI stocks—or, at least, that it's too hard to call the top to bet against them. They note that comparisons of today to the Dotcom Bubble ignore that tech valuations are below their Dotcom peaks, and that, unlike during the 1990s internet craze, the companies making the biggest investments in AI infrastructure are among the world's largest most profitable companies. Others point to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, which should stimulate data center construction by making borrowing more affordable. Rate cuts are also expected to increase liquidity in financial markets, likely boosting stock prices. AI excitement can still send a stock soaring despite the skeptics. Chipmaker AMD on Tuesday said it expects the AI chip market to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and that it is aiming to grow its share of that market to double digits. Oppenheimer analysts in a note on Wednesday called the updates "more sizzle than steak," and lamented the absence of a major customer announcement. Still, the projections caught the attention of investors. AMD shares finished today up more than 8%.

Title: AMD CEO Lisa Su Said AI Demand Is ‘Insatiable.’ The Chipmaker's Stock Is Soaring

Advanced Micro Devices shares are getting a boost from its outlook. The stock was up about 10% in early trading Wednesday, leading gains on the S&P 500 after the chipmaker yesterday unveiled ambitious new targets at its first analyst day. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) Chip stocks were broadly rising, too, with the SOX index of semiconductor shares up 1.5%. CEO Lisa Su on Tuesday told analysts the company is seeing "insatiable" AI demand, suggesting that its revenue growth could climb to 35% per year over the next three to five years, with gross margins of 55% to 58%. AMD (AMD) said last week its third-quarter adjusted gross margin was 54%. AMD said it now believes its total addressable AI market could be over $1 trillion by 2030, up from a previous target of $500 billion by 2028. The jump in AMD's stock price Wednesday could point to growing investor optimism in opportunities for the chipmaker, long seen as occupying a distant second place to AI chip leader Nvidia. Several Wall Street analysts said they remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock following the event, though they declined to raise their price targets amid persistent worries about an AI bubble and the possibility that AMD's upward momentum could reverse course if it pops. Citi analysts, who maintained a neutral rating for the shares, said they believe AMD's targets "will likely be maintained or exceeded until the AI bubble bursts but our conversations with investors indicate many are already there." "We believe the AI bubble will likely burst within a couple years and could result in much lower estimates," they wrote. Shares of AMD have roughly doubled in value in 2025 so far, with most of those gains coming in the past few months after a string of big AI deals, including one with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Title: US stocks are drifting around their records as AMD rallies

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted around their records in a mixed day of trading Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation. Their prices have shot so high, though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500. Similar questions about priciness are dogging the rest of the U.S. market, though not as pointedly as for Big Tech and AI superstars. One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: From Product Manager to Entrepreneur: The Grit, Grind, and Growth Behind the Title

Leaving a steady role at a company like American Express to start your own AI consulting firm sounds glamorous… until you realize just how much grit it takes to turn that vision into revenue. In a recent episode of Productside Stories, I sat down with Cooper Craig, a former product manager who traded enterprise decks for small-business deals and built a thriving AI agency from the ground up. His story (and his scars) reveal what it really takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur in 2025’s AI-charged economy. The timing isn’t accidental. 2025 has seen a wave of experienced product managers exploring entrepreneurship. Some are leaving big tech; others are launching AI automation consultancies, productized services, or indie SaaS tools. What’s driving the shift? Cooper’s journey from product manager to entrepreneur captures all three forces colliding at once. After being laid off from Amex in 2024, he found himself doing gig work to stay afloat — until he decided to build something of his own: Smartify AI, a consulting agency helping small and mid-sized businesses automate workflows and customer engagement with AI tools. What surprised Cooper most wasn’t the leap into entrepreneurship. It was how prepared he already was. “My product background is definitely my secret sauce,” he explained. “When a client comes to me saying, ‘I want AI to do this, this, and that,’ I can see through the noise. I know how to frame a problem, validate it, and build iteratively instead of over-engineering.” Every skill that makes PMs effective in organizations (discovery, prioritization, customer empathy, hypothesis testing) becomes an unfair advantage when building your own business. That combination is exactly what makes going from product manager to entrepreneur not just possible, but powerful. Cooper’s story isn’t a LinkedIn success reel. It’s a crash course in humility. When he was first laid off, he admits, “I felt like a failure. I’d been a PM for nearly 10 years and suddenly I was driving Uber to make ends meet.” That raw honesty resonated with product leaders everywhere. The truth is, the from product manager to entrepreneur journey almost always starts with uncertainty, not funding. Many PMs are wired for systems and predictability; entrepreneurship is the opposite. Cooper leaned on what PMs do best: structured learning. He spent a month immersing himself in no-code tools like Make.com and n8n, experimenting with automation workflows, voice agents, and AI assistants. Then, he landed his first client, a startup building the “GolfNow of pickleball.” From there, referrals snowballed. His key lesson? Momentum compounds faster than confidence. Build something small, ship it, and let outcomes rebuild belief. Ask any founder and they’ll tell you, getting clients is one thing, keeping up with them is another. Even after Smartify AI crossed $30K MRR, Cooper found himself trapped in the classic founder paradox: “I needed to hire help to grow, but I couldn’t hire until I grew.” The grind of going from product manager to entrepreneur often comes down to managing three overlapping systems: This is where experienced PMs have an edge. We know how to systematize, prioritize, and measure what matters. But make no mistake: founder life replaces Jira tickets with invoices, and stakeholder meetings with late-night problem-solving. Once you’ve survived the first year, something shifts. The same frameworks PMs use to guide product growth now guide business growth. Cooper uses his own version of a product roadmap to track his company’s milestones. Weekly sprints? Still there. Retrospectives? Absolutely. Only now, the “users” are clients, the “features” are services, and the “product” is the business itself. As AI consulting matures, he’s turning Smartify AI’s internal playbooks (like his VoiceMail Pro voice agent) into standalone products. That’s where the from product manager to entrepreneur evolution comes full circle: from managing someone else’s roadmap to owning your own. And for product leaders reading this, that’s the deeper takeaway: you already have the mindset, frameworks, and rigor of a founder. What you might lack is permission to start. If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur, Cooper’s advice is deceptively simple: Join our newsletter and stay up to date with all things current and Product Management related. © 2025 Productside.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. AI continues to ripple through the corporate world, with bosses eager to boost productivity and workers equally eager for tools that make their jobs easier. But as many AI pilots flop, the demand for employees who can actually apply the technology effectively has never been higher. That’s why Cisco is leaning on its workforce rather than cutting it. Unlike peers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture—who have trimmed staff—Cisco is investing in skilling up the employees it already has. “I don’t want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,” CEO Chuck Robbins said to CNBC in August. “I don’t want to get rid of engineers. I just want our engineers we have today to innovate faster and be more productive.” In practice, that’s meant in part giving developers access to AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. Already, about 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log in to AI coding tools at least once a month, and nearly a quarter of the company’s code is AI-generated—up from just 4% a year ago, according to Fletcher Previn, Cisco’s chief information officer. Internally, Cisco leaders are expected to pursue AI learning, in part because employees whose managers use AI are twice as likely to adopt it themselves, Scott McGuckin, Cisco’s global head of talent acquisition, told Fortune. And for those who do embrace the technology, the benefits are obvious. “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company,” McGuckin said. “Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” While tech companies are expected to slow their hiring as AI makes existing roles more productive, McGuckin said the war for talent remains competitive—and AI adoption is a top market differentiator. “For technical hires today, we look for relevant coding and engineering skills, which vary. Some of our coveted AI skill sets lie in AI and machine learning foundations and data science. Having these hard skills are a baseline to most applied roles,” he added. When push comes to shove, what really moves the needle in the hiring process is showing knowledge of AI in context, like responsible AI, ethics in bias detection, and explainability, McGuckin said. But for entry-level talent, that doesn’t mean you even need a degree. Demonstrating skills through coursework, research, or independent projects is often enough. In fiscal year 2023, 30% of Cisco’s entry-level hires were degreeless—something the company plans to expand upon. Cisco’s efforts are part of an industrywide movement to upskill workers for the AI era. In a recent report from the AI Workforce Consortium—led by Cisco and joined by Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP—it was found that seven out of 10 of the fastest-growing information and communications technology jobs were AI-related. The group also published a catalog of nearly 250 learning recommendations and an AI skills glossary to help workers navigate how to stay competitive in their field. Still, AI’s arrival hasn’t been without headaches. The hiring process has been infiltrated by fake candidates, often tied to North Korea. One report found that the number of companies that hired North Korean software developers grew a staggering 220% in the past year. Broadly speaking, McGuckin said Cisco has made vigilance a priority, increasing verification steps during the hiring process, including enhanced background checks that may involve an in-person component. “We want to assure all our applicants that there’s nothing they need to do differently when applying through Cisco’s talent portal—they are not losing out to fake candidates,” he said. “We feel the onus is on us, or employers at large, to create a safe and trustworthy candidate experience.” For Cisco, the challenge is straightforward: keep pace with AI’s rapid acceleration while making sure the people building it are both skilled—and real. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Tariffs could be coming for your Christmas tree

Time Published: 2025-11-12T14:55:44Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Forget the Grinch — this year, it’s tariffs that could try to steal the Christmas tree. Artificial Christmas trees will cost an estimated 10% to 20% more this season than they did last year because of increased tariff costs, according to several major U.S. importers. And the cost of lights could jump as much as 63% for the same reason. Mass market Christmas decor has not been manufactured in the United States for decades. If vendors were to try to make it domestically, the mere cost of moving the manufacturing operations would be prohibitive — let alone actually producing the trees. Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of artificial tree vendor Balsam Hill, estimates that if he were to manufacture Christmas trees in the U.S., the price of an $800 tree would skyrocket to around $3,000. “When we make Christmas trees, some of the equipment is the size of a U.S. football field,” he told NBC News in an interview. "There’s a ton of capital that’s invested in these factories, and the equipment’s so big you can’t even pick it up and put it on a container [ship] and transport it," he said. Moreover, the most popular artificial option, prelit trees, are a very labor intensive project, Harman said. The lights are often strung by hand, a job that American factories have neither the manpower nor the budgets to undertake. “There are over 20,000 people in China that manufacture Christmas trees. Many of those people are the ones that are experts in stringing the lights, and they’ve done it for a long time. They’re very fast at it. They’re good at it,” he said. Harman described how the U.S. export Christmas decor business first took off in Thailand in the 1990s, before moving to China over time. Now, he estimates, around 90% of mass market Christmas decor products are made in China. But that could be changing. Following Trump's election last November, Harman tried to diversify Balsam Hill’s supply chain because he anticipated the president would follow through with China tariffs after he had spent months campaigning on them. As a result of those diversification efforts, Harman said, during this Christmas season, around a third of Balsam Hill's trees will come from outside of China. Balsam Hill also tried to blunt tariff-related price pressures this year by importing the bulk of its inventory ahead of Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in April. But the administration's constant back-and-forth since then on China tariff rates — from a low of 30% at one point all the way up to 145% — proved too unpredictable for Harman to effectively execute the pricing plan he had initially wanted to. “Unfortunately, most of these trees [this year] have come into the industry at 20% or 30% tariffs. So those costs do add up,” he said. The overall supply of artificial trees will also take a hit this year, he said, after vendors opted to import fewer trees to offset the higher tariff costs. Harman said he expects the industry to stock 15% fewer artificial trees this season, potentially leading to fewer options for those who tree shop later in the season. Balsam Hill is not alone in paring back its Christmas decor imports during this year of outsized tariff impacts. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said on the company’s September quarterly earnings call that the big-box discounter had “really thinned down that whole category" of discretionary Christmas items such as toys and decor this year. Yet, in spite of the broader tariff pressures and stubbornly low consumer sentiment, the National Retail Federation forecasts that U.S. holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion this year for the first time. According to a recent National Retail Federation survey, the average consumer plans to spend around $270 on non-gift holiday items like decor and cards this season. One place that tariffs don't seem poised to bite American consumers this Christmas is in the live tree category. The vast majority of live trees that are sold stateside are grown in the U.S. But even those grown in Canada will be tariff-free this year under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. This comes even as the Trump administration enacts a 45% duty on Canadian lumber entering the U.S. According to the Real Christmas Tree Board, a live tree industry group, 84% of the wholesale Christmas tree growers it surveyed recently said they do not plan to increase prices this year. “We’re one of those few products where we can say, 'Hey, we don’t have to worry about that,'” Marsha Gray, the board’s executive director, told NBC News. And given that live Christmas trees take about 10 years to grow to market size, current economic factors like tariffs are not poised to impact supply in the next few years. “We’re at a point right now where we just have a really, really strong inventory, the strongest inventory I’ve seen in over a decade,” Gray said. No matter what type of Christmas tree people choose, the National Retail Federation says that while consumers may be slightly more cautious this year about shopping, they’re also more prepared. “Somehow, every year, Santa Claus always comes, and I think that really captures the way the holiday season goes,” federation President and CEO Matthew Shay wrote in the group's holiday forecast. “People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it.” Maya Huter is an associate producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: IBM's chief scientist has advice for entry-level engineers: Think beyond Big Tech

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. IBM's chief scientist has advice for recent grads hoping to land a software engineering job: Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after. "Don't just go for the standard 'I'm going to go and work for Google, Microsoft, IBM,'" Ruchir Puri told Business Insider. Puri, who has spent over three decades at IBM, said that as AI reshapes every industry, software engineers are needed across all sectors — whether that's transportation, manufacturing, or retail. He said job seekers should widen their search "beyond a narrow set of technology companies" and also consider the "massive enterprise landscape." For example, a company like John Deere, the world's largest agricultural equipment manufacturer, may not be top of mind for a software engineer looking for a job. However, Puri said the company is a household name, making a measurable impact. Other similar companies are hiring software engineers to help drive industry transformation, and being a part of that work can feel fulfilling, he said. "You are impacting something that is fundamental to global economy — and it's not just about technology," Puri said. Puri's comments come as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said in a CNBC interview that the company planned to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. However, new graduates are generally entering a challenging market. An August Handshake report found that job postings on the platform decreased by over 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, competition soared, with the average number of applications per job up by 26% year-over-year. Software engineering in general has undergone a shake-up in recent years. A saturated talent pool paired with rapid AI adoption has created an environment of uncertainty in hiring. While the tech industry is investing heavily in AI development, companies in the sector have also conducted consistent layoffs over the past few years. Giants like Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon all made cuts in 2025. Earlier this month, IBM announced it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter, impacting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce," a spokesperson told Business Insider. Krishna said in the CNBC interview that the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. Puri said that now is a good time for entry-level candidates to expand their view when it comes to finding meaningful work. "The world is your oyster," Puri said. "There are lots of companies in the world. All of them are looking to transform themselves with AI." Are you struggling to find a software engineering job? We want to hear from you.

November 12, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire This article has been disseminated on behalf of ESGold Corp., which may include a paid advertisement. AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Artificial intelligence may be driven by algorithms and code, but its hardware backbone depends on gold and silver — the same precious metals that connect every chip, circuit board and data hub worldwide. Global reserves of these materials are tightening even as industrial demand accelerates, creating a structural imbalance few foresaw. Silver remains unmatched as the essential conductor embedded in photovoltaic cells and high-speed electronic networks, while gold continues to serve as the corrosion-resistant benchmark for bonding wires, connectors and precision components. According to the World Gold Council, technology demand for gold reached approximately 326 tonnes last year, a 7% year-over-year increase, translating to more than 10.5 million ounces consumed across electronics and industrial applications. As AI infrastructure expands worldwide, that appetite for conductive metals is projected to rise sharply. Positioned to meet this growing need, ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (Profile) is advancing a fully funded, fully permitted gold-silver project engineered for near-term production and sustained growth. The company is working to align itself with the evolving ecosystem of producers and end users powering the next industrial transformation, including industry leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM).

AI Boom Turns Metals into New Bottleneck As the digital economy expands, the constraint is no longer software innovation but the physical supply of metals that makes modern intelligence possible. According to Goldman Sachs Research, electricity consumption from data centers is projected to surge by up to 165% by 2030 compared with 2023 levels, driven by the rapid construction of AI-optimized, high-density facilities. This explosive scale-up is cascading through supply chains. Every new server, accelerator and switch relies on gold-plated connectors and silver-rich solders, components whose durability and conductivity depend on these metals’ unique characteristics. The result is not a minor adjustment but a full-scale infrastructure transformation that pushes materials from background costs to headline risks. When supply tightens, manufacturing cannot wait. Production lines must continue, forcing technology companies to pay premiums to secure critical inputs. The signs of strain are already visible. Utilities across the United States are revising capacity plans around surging AI-driven electricity demand, while analysts warn that global data center consumption could more than double by 2030. In the spot market, stress has flared as well: in October 2025, Reuters reported a silver shortage in London significant enough to require airlifting bars, sending lease rates sharply higher before stabilizing. For manufacturers, these developments mean urgency, not choice; when gold-plated contacts and silver-bearing solders are essential, there is no substitute. Electronics and renewable energy sectors are compounding the draw. The World Gold Council reports that technology demand for gold rose to 326 tonnes in 2024, equivalent to roughly 10.5 million ounces, while the Silver Institute logged industrial silver demand at a record 680.5 million ounces, marking the fourth consecutive year of structural deficit. Even smartphones are a steady source of consumption: Each device contains around 7 to 34 milligrams of gold, and with roughly 1.4 billion units produced annually, they represent a consistent, noncyclical sink before factoring in PCs, servers and networking equipment. The outcome is a tightening materials stack that increasingly dictates the pace and cost of AI, EV and solar deployment. Clean, Construction-Ready Supply on Track In this tightening landscape, ESGold is positioning its flagship Montauban Gold-Silver Project to deliver near-term, clean metal supply without the long permitting timelines or financing gaps that delay many mining ventures. The Québec-based project is fully permitted and fully funded through construction, which is slated for completion in late 2025, with first production anticipated in 2026. For investors, that combination of capital security, regulatory clearance and visible progress eliminates many of the standard risks that hinder development-stage projects. ESGold’s strategy centers on reprocessing historical tailings instead of pursuing a traditional greenfield mine build. By leveraging existing, mined material and a proven, environmentally responsible processing circuit, the company aims to accelerate its path to cash flow while preserving upside for broader district exploration. Company updates have detailed ongoing installation and commissioning of a Merrill-Crowe recovery system, alongside an on-site lab and gold room, all tangible milestones that mark the transition from planning to production readiness. Funding stability remains a cornerstone of ESGold’s story. A September 2025 update confirmed full financing to complete Montauban’s buildout and advance a parallel validation initiative in Colombia. In a market where many junior miners struggle for capital, a clear route to commissioning is a strategic advantage, particularly as industrial and technology players grow more attuned to materials security and reliable supply. Turning Waste into Value and Growth ESGold’s business model reverses the traditional mining playbook. Instead of requiring years of exploration and heavy upfront spending, it generates early revenue by reprocessing tailings — monetizing material already extracted — while contributing to environmental restoration. The company’s updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) outlines compelling economics, including an after-tax internal rate of return of about 60%, a payback period of less than two years, and an after-tax net present value above C$24 million at a 5% discount rate based on stated recovery and pricing assumptions. While PEAs are inherently preliminary, these figures depict a fast-cycling project capable of reinvesting capital into expansion and exploration. That pace matters in today’s market, where hardware manufacturers and energy developers face extended supply lead times. Bringing additional gold and silver to market by 2026 positions ESGold ahead of slower-moving peers. Self-funded growth also offers flexibility: Revenues from tailings can support step-out drilling or modular capacity increases with less dilution, strengthening long-term project resilience. Tailings reprocessing aligns neatly with modern environmental and supply chain priorities. Recovering metals from previously mined material reduces permitting complexity, minimizes new waste, and produces clean, saleable metal, all attributes increasingly valued by downstream buyers. As technology and renewable energy companies tighten ESG procurement standards, the intersection of early cash flow and responsible production widens ESGold’s potential offtake opportunities. Scalable Growth in a Supply-Constrained Market By working with known, high-grade tailings rather than exploring from scratch, ESGold eliminates much of the uncertainty that typically accompanies early-stage projects while maintaining upside for discovery across the Montauban district. The company’s steady construction progress on a fully permitted, fully financed project stands out in a preproduction sector where many competitors remain years away from revenue. Scalability is central to ESGold’s long-term vision. Tailings reprocessing is modular by design; it can be replicated efficiently across other regions once technical processes are validated. ESGold has indicated its intention to expand this “tailings-to-cash-flow” model throughout the Americas, layering in throughput and revenue while keeping risk manageable. This approach appeals to both end users, who seek diversified, verifiable metal sources, and financiers, who value repeatable, low-capex unit economics. Market conditions reinforce the opportunity. Industrial silver demand hit 680.5 million ounces in 2024, its highest level on record, while the global market ran a fourth consecutive deficit. For gold, the World Gold Council attributes technology-related growth to AI and electronics. In such an environment, near-term producers with proven funding and infrastructure readiness can capture premium pricing and preferred offtake relationships while others remain in development limbo. Expanding Discovery Across Montauban Alongside construction, ESGold is advancing exploration across the Montauban district. The company reports that its 3D geological modeling program is nearly complete, integrating historic and geophysical data to pinpoint deeper, previously untapped structures. Technical studies indicate continuous geological formations extending to about 1,200 meters, suggesting the potential for large-scale mineralization beyond the tailings resource. Earlier updates cited passive seismic imaging as a key tool refining Montauban’s structural understanding. The intent is to evolve from a single-site reprocessing project into a multifeed “hub and spoke” operation sourcing material from both tailings and new discoveries. ESGold’s parallel progress on permitting ensures drilling can begin swiftly once exploration targets are finalized, maintaining operational momentum. This dual-track approach — producing revenue while pursuing exploration — sets ESGold apart from peers that must choose between near-term cash flow and long-term upside. The Montauban project seeks to deliver both: immediate production from tailings and the potential for district-scale expansion. Even if only a portion of these deeper zones convert to defined resources, ESGold’s growth runway could extend well beyond its initial operating phase. This balance, near-term production with concurrent exploration, differentiates ESGold from juniors locked into long-dated builds. Investors are often forced to choose between cash flow and blue-sky upside. Montauban aims to deliver both, sequencing revenue first and then targeting scale. If even part of the deeper target set converts into resources, the platform for a multiyear district story strengthens. If not, the base case remains a permitted, funded operation monetizing tailings in a tight metals market. Ready Supply in Tightening Market Scarcity creates opportunity. With AI infrastructure, EV production and solar deployment all intensifying demand for precious metals, supply constraints are moving from a background concern to a central business risk for manufacturers. The Silver Institute’s data confirming consecutive structural deficits, along with spot-market disruptions such as the recent London squeeze, illustrate how quickly inventory stress can surface when industrial and investor demand converge. For producers capable of adding new metal supply with low capital costs and rapid paybacks, these market dynamics favor revaluation as production nears. Few preproduction companies can credibly claim to be both fully permitted and fully funded while advancing construction on schedule. ESGold’s PEA projects a roughly 60% after-tax internal rate of return and a payback under two years, underscoring the project’s efficiency. As AI and renewable infrastructure expand globally, the material bottleneck is becoming a defining theme, and ESGold is positioned to address it directly. The broader narrative returns to the core thesis: AI, electrification and renewable energy are as much materials revolutions as they are technological ones. Gold and silver are not merely safe-haven assets; they are essential building blocks of digital and clean energy ecosystems. As industrial demand rises and new mine development remains slow, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that can provide dependable near-term supply while maintaining exploration upside. ESGold belongs to this select group. With its Montauban Gold-Silver Project fully financed, fully permitted, and advancing toward production in 2026, the company offers both stability and scalability. Ongoing exploration adds long-term potential, creating a balanced opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the metals that underpin the next generation of technology and energy infrastructure.

Stock futures are higher this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Tuesday; the House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation to end the six-week U.S. government shutdown; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising after the chipmaker projected strong revenue growth over the coming years; the White House is reportedly examining measures that could limit the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers in shareholder voting; and shares of On Holding are soaring after the sneaker maker posted strong earnings and raised its guidance. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher as investors keep close tabs on developments in Washington D.C., with a key vote scheduled later today that could end government shutdown. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.2% recently after the blue-chip index closed at a record high on Tuesday. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was at just under $105,000, up from an overnight low of around $102,500. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $4,140 an ounce, trading near their highest levels in three weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was at 4.08%, down from the previous close of 4.11%. The House of Representatives is set to vote on a spending measure that would reopen the government through January and end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A key House committee moved the Senate-passed legislation forward in an early-Wednesday vote, rejecting attempts by some Democrats to amend the legislation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation, bringing an end to the shutdown, which is now in its 43rd day. The work stoppage has contributed to a freeze on U.S. government economic reports, while also creating staffing issues in the air traffic control system that prompted officials to reduce the number of flights. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped in premarket trading after CEO Lisa Su said the chipmaker’s revenue could grow by 35% annually over the next three-to-five years owing to continued strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. At the company’s first-ever analysts day on Tuesday, Su said that the company’s AI data center business could grow by 80% annually over the same period, potentially hitting tens of billions of dollars in sales by 2027. AMD also said its gross margins would come in at around 55% to 58% in coming years, ahead of analysts' forecasts. Shares of AMD, which have nearly doubled in value since the start of the year, were up 6% ahead of the bell. The White House is looking at new measures that would reduce the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers on shareholder voting, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Trump administration officials are considering executive orders that could ban proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis from making recommendations on shareholder votes. Officials are also looking to curtail the influence of index-fund managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, according to the report. The influence of proxy firms has been criticized by top corporate executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who faced resistance from proxy advisers ahead of a recent shareholder vote on his trillion-dollar pay package. Shares of On Holding (ONON) are soaring in premarket trading after the Roger Federer-backed Swiss sneaker maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook. On posted adjusted earnings of 0.43 Swiss francs ($0.54) per share on net sales that jumped 25% year-over-year to 794.4 million Swiss francs ($994.2 million), well above Wall Street estimates. The Zurich-based company, which lifted its guidance for a third straight quarter, now expects full-year sales to grow by 34% on a constant-currency basis, up from a previous projection of at least 31%. Profitability is also expected to rise. On co-founder and executive co-chairman Caspar Coppetti told CNBC the company won't be offering Black Friday deals and will be "full price through the holiday season." On shares, which through yesterday's close had shed more than a third of their value this year, were up 8% in recent trading.

November 12, 2025 03:01 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. New ODM Self-Certification Program, Open Networking Initiative, and Open Source Software Contributions Fuel Flexible, Adaptable Private Clouds New and Expanded Collaborations Announced with Cisco, Intel, OVHcloud, SNUC and Supermicro PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) announced it is advancing an open, extensible ecosystem for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), enabling customers to build, connect, protect, and extend their modern private clouds. With these announcements, Broadcom is delivering a private cloud platform that is open and adaptable across all infrastructure layers. Customers will have increased ability to leverage their preferred data center and edge hardware infrastructure, open networking constructs, and open source technologies for on-prem and hosted private cloud environments, while VCF partners will have more opportunity for innovation. “The momentum behind VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is undeniable. It's a platform that's redefining how organizations approach their private cloud journey, offering a consistent operating model that spans data centers to the edge,” said Paul Turner, Chief Product Officer, VMware Cloud Foundation Division, Broadcom. “By fostering an open VCF ecosystem, we're empowering businesses to build modern private clouds that align with their strategic needs, ensuring they can leverage the technologies required for their unique environments.” Open Hardware Ecosystem Enables Flexibility and Choice for Modern Private Cloud DeploymentsBroadcom is expanding its open hardware certification program to increase Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) participation through new VCF AI ReadyNodes, ODM self-service certification, and support for new edge systems. “Supermicro is excited to be among the first hardware OEMs to certify our industry-leading GPU systems as VCF AI ReadyNodes,” said Ismail Sayeeduddin, Vice President, Business Development, Supermicro. “This milestone gives customers a clear migration path from previously certified Supermicro systems in the VMware certification program to the latest fully validated and optimized GPU solutions that help eliminate the cost and complexity of AI adoption.” “Broadcom's open certification program for VCF Ready hardware supports our vertical integration strategy, enabling us to self-certify our server systems for VMware Cloud Foundation,” said Yaniv Fdida, chief product and technology officer for OVHcloud. “This will reinforce our commitment to deliver our customers with competitive, high-performance private cloud services that remain cost-effective. Broadcom’s program will help accelerate our time-to-market for innovative and secure cloud solutions powered by VMware technology, further solidifying our position as a leading global cloud player.” “Broadcom's expansion of the ReadyNode certification program accelerates the deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 platforms,” said Caitlin Anderson, Corporate Vice President, Americas Sales at Intel Corporation. “This combination delivers greater hardware consolidation and cost optimization, which, when delivered through certified configurations, directly enables AI adoption via faster infrastructure modernization.” “The pairing of purpose-built SNUC extremeEDGE servers with VMware Cloud Foundation will enable customers across industries to deliver the edge of tomorrow,” said Steve Savage, chief operating officer at SNUC. “Through self-certification of extremeEDGE as part of Broadcom’s expanded ReadyNode program, we will deliver our edge innovations faster, helping our mutual customers across industrial manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and the federal government maximize the value of AI.” Open Networking to Simplify Private Cloud Deployments with EVPN FabricsBroadcom is announcing a new strategy to unify network fabrics and simplify networking operations in the modern private cloud through standards-based EVPN and BGP networking. This strategy will enhance interoperability between application environments and the network, promoting cloud-like simplicity. The open standards approach will accelerate deployments, enable multi-vendor flexibility, and preserve existing network investments. Customers will benefit from VPC level protection, consistent network operations, routing, and visibility across VCF Networking (NSX) domains and third-party networking solutions, enabling unified operations with end-to-end fabric-driven automation. This approach aligns VCF and Cisco’s Nexus One fabric solution, promoting more consistent and reliable outcomes for mutual Cisco and VCF customers across data center fabric architectural design choices. Cisco’s unified Nexus One fabric approach implements a standard-based VXLAN EVPN control plane and data plane. With VCF’s move towards EVPN-based interoperability and a unified and open architecture, customers can drive faster innovation, shorten time to value, and lower total cost of ownership as VCF extends to the Cisco Nexus One fabric solution. “Cisco's foundational work in VxLAN EVPN, backed by the industry's most comprehensive IETF standards authorship, reflects our long-standing commitment to open networking,” said Murali Gandluru, Vice President, Data Center Networking, Cisco. “This collaboration with Broadcom demonstrates our shared commitment to open standards—giving our customers architectural flexibility and choice as they connect, protect and scale both AI and traditional, business-critical workloads.” Additionally, VCF Networking (NSX) supports Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC), an open-source network operating system based on Linux, in customer deployments today. SONiC provides customers with cost reduction by running on multi-vendor, commodity switch hardware, lowering both capital and operational expenses. The modular, containerized architecture accelerates innovation and agility, allowing operators to perform seamless, zero-downtime feature upgrades and rapid component rollbacks. Furthermore, its Linux Foundation and native API support enhances automation and control, to simplify operations and integrate networking management directly into modern, cloud-scale DevOps workflows. Open Source Community Contributions Enable Industry InnovationBroadcom continues to be an active participant in the Kubernetes community as a top five long-term contributor to CNCF, with contributions to projects such as Antrea, Cluster API, ContainerD, Contour, etcd, Harbor and others. Recently, the CNCF launched the Certified Kubernetes AI Conformance Program, a new initiative to standardize AI workloads on Kubernetes and ensure consistent, interoperable infrastructure for organizations moving AI into production. Broadcom is announcing that VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) is now a Certified Kubernetes AI Conformant Platform. This milestone reinforces Broadcom’s commitment to open standards and helps customers innovate freely, knowing their AI platforms are built on a consistent, interoperable foundation. “VMware by Broadcom has been a long-time contributor to CNCF and continues to play a key role in supporting core projects like Kubernetes,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud & Infrastructure at the Linux Foundation. “Their ongoing investment helps keep Kubernetes vendor-neutral and production-ready at scale, especially for newer AI workloads, and is critical for the health of the broader cloud native ecosystem.” Additional Resources About BroadcomBroadcom Inc.

Title: The difficulty of tracking and interpreting AI usage labels

Full Content:
by Tom Johnson on Nov 12, 2025 comments categories: ai Tracking and communicating AI usage in docs turns out to be not only challenging technically, but also potentially full of interpretive pitfalls. There seems to be a double-edged sword at work. On the one hand, we want to track the degree to which AI is being used in doc work so we can quantify, measure, and evaluate the impact of AI. On the other hand, if a tech writer calls out that they used AI for a documentation changelist, it might falsely create the impression that AI did all the work, reducing the value of including the human at all. In this post, I'll explore these dilemmas. Reasons to track AI usage Identifying AI-written content improves the review Problems with identifying AI usage AI fluency is an underrated skill Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail Conclusion Works Cited Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. Reasons to track AI usage First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. Identifying AI-written content improves the review There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Problems with identifying AI usage Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: Because this changelist has an AI-generated label, I assume AI created the content. If AI is creating this content, why am I paying a tech writer here? I should instead be buying more AI chips. Conclusion: Let’s reroute the money to AI chips instead of tech writer salaries. This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. AI fluency is an underrated skill Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Conclusion Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.

Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.
