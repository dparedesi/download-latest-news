Global Times By Global Times Published: Jul 18, 2025 05:39 PM In response to a Wall Street Journal report claiming that China would block a deal in which CK Hutchison Holdings would transfer ownership of its Panama Canal port and dozens of other ports globally to Western investors such as BlackRock unless China COSCO Shipping Corporation was granted a stake, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Friday that he is not aware of the situation the reporter mentioned. Regarding CK Hutchison's sale of overseas port assets, China's State Administration for Market Regulation has already stated that it will conduct a review in accordance with the law, protect fair market competition, and safeguard the public interest, Lin said. The spokesperson also emphasized that China has always firmly opposed acts of economic coercion and bullying that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.

Title: ₹1 crore savings and life is set? It is high time to relook at your age old middle class dream

“Ek crore ho gaya toh life set hai” -- This sentence has echoed across drawing rooms, chai stalls, the LIC agent brochures for decades and not to mention Amitabh Bachchan’s deep voice emphasising the importance of “ek crore” in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in early 2000s. It was the ultimate middle-class milestone — the surefire way of making it big in life. But in 2025, that one-crore dream does not hold much water? It’s more of a mirage than a milestone. Because by the time you say “I’ve made it”, inflation, EMIs, and real-life curveballs have already gatecrashed the party. Let’s unmask the myth that ₹1 crore is enough and see why financial “settling down” has become a moving goalpost. 1. Inflation is eating your money faster than you think: In the early 2000s, ₹1 crore could buy you a house, a car, and still leave enough for FD interest to run your household. But not today. In a city like Bangalore or Mumbai, this won’t even get you a decent 2BHK house. Add to that 4-6% inflation, and your one crore will feel like ₹30–40 lakh in no time. Reality: The same ₹30 dosa is now ₹120, and that’s just breakfast. 2. One medical emergency can wipe out your savings: Middle-class families are just one health scare away from financial turmoil. A decent cancer treatment, bypass surgery, or organ transplant costs ₹15–30 lakh. If your health cover is the standard ₹5 lakh from years ago, your savings become collateral damage. One ICU bill = Goodbye one crore. 3. Lifestyle inflation is real: Your lifestyle has levelled up, but have your savings kept pace? From iPhones to impulse Zomato orders, your crore can vanish without warning. 4. Job security is an illusion: And sadly, no private sector job is permanent anymore, not even in MNCs, IT, or startups. One recession, one restructuring, or one AI tool and boom – layoffs, pay cuts, or upskilling pressure. Ask any techie in their 40s — they’ve seen the axe fall. So if your plan was: “Retire early, start a homestay in Goa” with that crore, it is better to rework the spreadsheet. 5. Children’s education costs a fortune: Think ₹1 crore will help you chill post-retirement? Think again. A decent Indian private university will cost you ₹30–40 lakh. Foreign education? ₹1–1.5 crore easily. And this doesn’t even include coaching fees, laptops, or hostel charges. So basically: one child = one crore. Why do we still worship this ₹1 crore figure? Because it feels big. It’s a round, shiny number. But feelings don’t beat facts. And in today’s India, facts are brutal. Financial stability is no longer a destination. It’s a continuous journey and ₹1 crore is just the petrol pump, not the finish line. Multiple income sources: Don’t just rely on one job. Freelance, invest, rent out property — hustle smart, not just hard. Large emergency reserve: It is recommended to keep 6 to 12 months of expenses ready. One job loss shouldn’t lead to moving into your parents’ house. Health and life insurance: Get real coverage ₹25–50 lakh minimum for health. And no, your office insurance doesn’t count when you’re between the jobs. Smart investing: FDs won’t save you. SIPs in mutual funds, index funds, NPS — that’s where your money should be working overtime. Financial literacy: You don’t need a full-fledged chartered accountancy qualification but you definitely must understand inflation, taxation, and compounding. Your financial future relies on it. Most middle-class Indians aren’t financially stable, they’re just financially suspended. One layoff, one surgery, one market crash and the whole “life set hai" illusion collapses like a pack of cards. Ask yourself:If your income had stopped today, for how long would you live your current lifestyle?If your answer is less than 10–12 years — you’re not “settled.” You’re playing financial Jenga, hoping the next brick doesn’t topple everything. “Life is stable only when money works for you in your sleep and your survival doesn’t depend on active income.” So, the ₹one crore dream isn’t dead, it just needs an upgrade – perhaps to a bigger number. Add hustle, protection, awareness, and growth to it and then you’re getting close to “settled.” Catch all the Instant Personal Loan, Business Loan, Business News, Money news, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Treasury Yields Slide After Waller's July Rate Cut Call: Markets Wrap

Bond yields fell as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his case for a July rate cut, while data showed consumer expectations for inflation improved. Stocks wavered amid earnings. President Donald Trump signed the stablecoins bill in a win for the crypto industry. Short-dated Treasuries led gains as Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold rates steady in July. Bonds also rose as University of Michigan data showed consumers expect prices to increase at an annual rate of 4.4% over the next year, down from 5% in the prior month. The S&P 500 was little changed. The dollar edged lower, but notched an advance for the week. “Investors have something to cheer about with signs of improved inflation expectations,” said Jeff Roach at LPL Financial. “According to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging.” Meantime, Waller said he sees no sign that inflation expectations are on the rise, which allows the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. He also restated the case the Fed should cut when policymakers gather later this month, given data suggesting the US labor market is “on the edge.” “We think he is correct. The Fed’s role is to think ahead, not look behind, which is what Waller is doing concerning the slowing employment situation,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Nonetheless a July cut won’t happen.” Money markets still assign near-zero odds of a cut on July 30. They price in about 45 basis points of easing by year-end, down from more than 65 basis points at the start of the month. US consumer sentiment rose to a five-month high in early July as expectations about the economy continued to improve. The preliminary July sentiment index rose to 61.8 from 60.7 a month earlier, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. The report offered further relief after data this week showed US retail sales rebounded in June in a broad advance, tempering some concerns about a retrenchment in consumer spending. To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, macroeconomic data remains broadly supportive, and the recent strength in markets has been impressive, though perhaps even more noteworthy is the prevailing sense of calm amid a busy and often volatile news cycle. “Investors have responded positively to robust economic indicators and earnings reports that highlight continued resilience in US consumer spending,” he said. “The rest of earnings season will be a key test given elevated valuations and expectations, though with current momentum and sentiment, the path of least resistance is higher.” At Wolfe Research, Chris Senyek says economic data releases this week have been consistent with his view that the US economy is coming in better than consensus expects. “However, we continue to be worried about the risk of inflation remaining stickier than expected in the back half of 2025,” Senyek noted. The stock market’s relatively modest gains this week despite mostly solid economic data and earnings could be a preview for much of the rest of the year, according to Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team. “While tariff uncertainty continues, the markets may be learning to live with it, to a certain extent,” he said. “But with a decisive resolution unlikely in the near term and the Fed holding the line on rate cuts, price action at the index level could remain congested.” Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US’s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times reported. Meantime, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the two nations could reach a “good” trade deal while signaling the process may take more time. “The lack of any clear damage from the tariffs, solid earnings results, a firm job market, and consumers who keep spending are supporting the high valuations,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. The Food and Drug Administration plans to ask Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. to pause shipments of its Elevidys treatment after three deaths were linked to the company’s gene therapies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Humana Inc. lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments, a blow for the insurer that had hoped the court would restore billions in revenue. American Express Co.’s expenses grew in the second quarter as the firm made risk-management investments for its affluent consumers, who continued to spend amid economic uncertainty. Netflix Inc. beat expectations for second-quarter results and continues to trounce rival media companies, yet the shares slipped on Friday as investors took a pause after the stock has nearly doubled over the past year. 3M Co. raised its profit forecast and beat Wall Street’s estimates for the second quarter as Chief Executive Officer William Brown’s effort to reinvigorate the company gained momentum. Chevron Corp. has prevailed in a 20-month fight to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, overcoming a challenge by arch rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that was unprecedented in the modern history of Big Oil. SLB, the world’s largest oil-services provider, sees resiliency in the industry and remains constructive about the second half of 2025 despite uncertainties in customer demand. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. reported total net interest income for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. Charles Schwab Corp. reported earnings per share that topped estimates as the firm said client assets hit a new record and trading revenue rose. Ally Financial Inc. left most of its forecast unchanged despite strong second-quarter consumer auto-loan originations and earnings. Meta Platforms Inc. said it won’t sign the code of practice for Europe’s new set of laws governing artificial intelligence, calling the guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act overreach. The S&P 500 was little changed as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 was little changed The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% The MSCI World Index was little changed Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 0.7% The Russell 2000 Index fell 0.6% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1622 The British pound was little changed at $1.3413 The Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 148.73 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $117,433.01 Ether rose 3.9% to $3,554.18 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.43% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.70% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 4.67% The yield on 2-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 3.87% The yield on 30-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 5.00% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $67.38 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,348.06 an ounce

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Amid rising infrastructure demands, AI startups like Crusoe Energy Systems are tapping large-scale credit lines, PitchBook reported. Crusoe last month raised a $750 million credit facility from Brookfield Asset Management BAM to expand its data centers and acquire more graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. NVDA. That deal reflects a broader trend in venture financing. AI and machine learning startups have secured an outsized share of venture debt so far, accounting for more than a third of the $30 billion deployed across the U.S. and Europe, according to PitchBook. That marks a significant increase from 2024, when such companies attracted 24.9%, or $22.9 billion, of total debt funding. Don't Miss: According to PitchBook, the shift toward debt financing is being driven by rising compute costs and high early-stage valuations in AI. "There are companies coming out of the gate with these large chunky seed rounds," Silicon Valley Bank Managing Director, Early-Stage Startups Bo Ren told PitchBook. "But then there's a Series A valuation drop-off because they can't live up to the VC expectations." Ren said that many AI startups are turning to venture debt earlier in their lifecycle as they struggle to maintain growth targets set by their inflated early valuations. Ren also cited infrastructure costs as a key factor: "Given the cost of compute, it's very much like the price of gas, it just keeps going up and up. That's where a lot of the venture debt conversations start," she told Pitchbook. PitchBook data shows that the median pre-money valuation for AI startups has climbed to $25 million so far this year, up from $15 million in 2024. Trending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share Several AI infrastructure startups have recently raised major venture debt deals to purchase high-performance chips. Lambda Labs also raised a $500 million special-purpose financing vehicle, collateralized by GPUs it already owned, to expand its chip inventory. GPU cloud provider CoreWeave CRWE, which recently went public, raised $2.3 billion in debt with similar terms, PitchBook reported. The loan was backed by the company's Nvidia GPU stockpile. See Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25 "How long is the useful life of those chips? If it's 10 years or even seven years, that makes sense," CIBC Innovation Banking Executive Managing Director and Co-Head Paul McKinlay told PitchBook. "But if it's two years, that starts to become a tougher proposition." PitchBook reported that total venture debt deployment reached $53.3 billion in 2024, a 94.5% increase from 2023. That growth was primarily fueled by later-stage startups preserving valuations amid slowing VC rounds. In 2025, AI is driving the next wave of venture debt demand—now extending to earlier-stage companies.

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

Time Published: 2025-07-19T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Clay Chandler is executive editor, Asia, at Fortune. On a recent morning in an industrial zone near Hong Kong’s bustling cargo port, a white MG electric taxi glided into a narrow kiosk resembling a car wash. A hydraulic lift elevated the vehicle, allowing a guided mechanical system to slide out the taxi’s depleted battery and replace it with a fully charged one. There was no plugging in, no waiting around to recharge. The taxi was ready for the road in under three minutes. That battery-swapping kiosk is the first of a network of hundreds planned for Hong Kong by U Power, a little-known startup from Shanghai that aims to electrify the beating heart of the city’s notoriously antiquated taxi fleet. The opportunity is huge. In Hong Kong, electric vehicles make up just 4% of the city’s 119,000 commercial vehicles, including taxis, buses, and delivery vans. For taxis, the percentage of EVs is even lower. As of December 2024, Hong Kong had only 90 electric taxis, accounting for 0.5% of the city’s 18,163 licensed cabs. That’s a stark contrast to the 24% penetration rate among the city’s private auto fleet. Hong Kong is representative of a global phenomenon: Of the more than 400 million commercial vehicles worldwide, fewer than 1% are electric. Even in cities with high EV penetration rates—including San Francisco, Oslo, and Amsterdam—electric taxis remain a rarity. In theory, Hong Kong’s taxi owners have strong financial incentives to make the switch. Electric motors, with fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines, are cheaper to run and maintain. Several recent studies suggest fuel costs for EVs are more than 70% lower than for gas-powered vehicles, translating to annual savings of about $10,000 per taxi. The Hong Kong government offers further inducements: it has waived first-time registration taxes for electric taxis and granted a 45,000 Hong Kong dollar (about $5,750) subsidy per vehicle to operators who switch from gas to electric. Still, owners and drivers are wary. For commercial vehicles, especially taxis, every minute of downtime means lost revenue. Conventional EV charging is far too slow for high-utilization fleets. Hong Kong has more than 11,000 public EV chargers, but only about 2,000 are quick or fast chargers, capable of restoring batteries to 80% in 30 to 60 minutes. The rest can take several hours to fully recharge a vehicle—time most drivers don’t have. As Li points out, the average taxi driver earns 200 Hong Kong dollars (about $25) per hour: “You ask them to sit idle for two hours? No way. That’s 400 [Hong Kong] dollars gone.” On top of that, many public charging stations impose hourly parking fees, further eroding the economic case for EVs. Battery swapping stations could eliminate that downtime—but only if U Power can build enough of them across the city and persuade drivers to embrace the model. The company hopes to have four stations in operation in Hong Kong by the end of this year and ultimately envisions a citywide network of more than 200. Hong Kong is a high-profile testbed, but Li has global ambitions. U Power has launched pilots in Singapore and Macau and is actively rolling out swap stations in Thailand, Mexico, Portugal, and Peru. Li sees Thailand and Mexico as particularly promising due to their large taxi fleets and high vehicle turnover. Bangkok, he notes, has 80,000 taxis; Mexico City has more than 100,000. In Thailand, U Power last year signed a strategic partnership with SAIC Motor–CP Co., a joint venture between one of China’s largest automakers and CP Group, Thailand’s largest conglomerate. The venture aims to integrate battery-swapping technology into MG taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. (Disclosure: Fortune’s owner, Chatchaval Jiaravanon, is a member of the family that controls the CP Group, and he is one of U Power’s largest investors.) U Power has also formed a joint venture with SUSCO, a Thai oil and fuel retailer, to install kiosks at its network of 200 gas stations and teamed up with Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Auto Leasing & Service to deploy a fleet of swapping-compatible MGs in the island province of Phuket. And the company now says that it plans to move its operational headquarters from Shanghai to Bangkok in order to fuel its global expansion. In Mexico, the company has partnered with fleet operator Vizeon New Energy to develop swap-compatible EV taxis, buses, and trucks, and install pilot swap stations in three major cities. Similar efforts are underway in Lisbon and Lima, where U Power is targeting midsize fleet operators and delivery platforms. Notably, though, U Power has no plans to enter the world’s two largest markets: the U.S. and China. Li calls the U.S. an EV laggard, hampered by low urban density, fragmented infrastructure, and an unpredictable regulatory landscape for Chinese tech companies. He’s also ruled out the Chinese mainland due to fierce competition, entrenched EV incumbents, and a power grid so advanced that ultra-fast charging is widely available—making battery swapping largely unnecessary. China’s largest cities are notable exceptions to the global dominance of gas-powered taxis. Electric vehicles account for more than 95% of the taxi fleet in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In Shenzhen, the sprawling metropolis just across the border from Hong Kong, authorities have mandated the conversion of the city’s entire taxi and bus fleets to electric vehicles as far back as 2018. U Power’s plans for global expansion sparked one of the most explosive post-IPO rallies in Nasdaq history. When the company debuted in April 2023, shares shot up over 600% on opening day, triggering multiple trading halts. Retail traders piled in, lured by the promise of a disruptive Chinese EV infrastructure play. The stock, which trades under the moniker UCAR, peaked at $901 in June before speculative fervor collapsed. By year’s end shares had slumped to $18. Over the past 52 weeks, U Power’s share price has oscillated between $9.05 and $2.47, with day-to-day swings often exceeding 10%. The stock currently trades below $4.00, down more than 50% year-to-date. No major Wall Street analyst currently follows UCAR. U Power’s stock’s slump reflects investor skepticism about the feasibility of its “battery-as-a-service” model and frustration with its lackluster financials. Critics question whether a battery swap network—capital intensive, dependent on fleet adoption, and distributed across so many different markets—can scale profitably. The company, launched in 2013, remains unprofitable, posting a $7.7 million net loss on $6.08 million in revenue in 2024, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Li insists the company will break even in 2025 and triple profits in 2026, thanks to expanding fleet contracts and growing subscription revenue in Southeast Asia and Latin America. To realize Li’s grand visions, U Power must secure hundreds of viable swap sites in some of the world’s most crowded cities. That’s an especially daunting proposition in Hong Kong, where land is expensive, and each location will require zoning approvals, grid connectivity, and all-hours vehicle access. So far, U Power has identified just ten potential sites in the city. The bigger challenge may be cultural. Winning over Hong Kong’s 17 major taxi fleet owners and some 46,000 fiercely independent drivers means reshaping deep-seated habits and suspicions. U Power’s model requires operators to give up battery ownership, retrofit vehicles with the company’s proprietary UOTTA interface, and pay monthly subscription fees tied to battery use—terms that may not sit easily with a sector long allergic to centralized control. Li insists the economics will win out. By decoupling batteries from vehicles, he argues, taxi owners can reduce up-front costs by as much as 40%. U Power, meanwhile, assumes responsibility for charging logistics, battery health monitoring, and end-of-life recycling. As batteries degrade, they’re rotated into less demanding uses—like stationary energy storage—or recycled outright. To sweeten the deal, Li has floated a blockchain-based incentive system. Each battery contains a chip that logs usage, charging behavior, and wear. Drivers who follow optimal patterns—avoiding peak-hour swaps, returning batteries in good condition—can earn digital tokens redeemable for energy discounts or services. The goal: a transparent, self-regulating marketplace that reduces strain on the grid while rewarding smart usage. Whether Hong Kong’s notoriously unruly taxi sector will buy in remains to be seen. The city’s iconic red, green, and blue cabs—red for Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, green for the New Territories, and blue for Lantau—are instantly recognizable symbols of the city. They’re also famously idiosyncratic. Most drivers still accept cash only and have long attracted complaints of rude service, overcharging, and reckless driving. Reform efforts have repeatedly hit walls: A proposed fee hike in 1984 triggered citywide riots; drivers staged mass strikes in 1991 and 2008; and just this February, the drivers’ union threatened another unless the government cracked down on unlicensed ride-hailing services like Uber. At U Power’s Hong Kong launch ceremony in June, the chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Drivers & Operators Association attended and signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to promote the adoption of the UOTTA system. Notably, though, no representatives of the Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association, which represents the interests of taxi license holders—and is generally considered the more politically powerful of the two major taxi unions—attended the event. Still, the symbolism of electrifying Hong Kong’s taxis is potent. In 2023, when the city’s stock exchange opened offices in New York and London, it marked the milestone with a cheeky global ad campaign featuring then-CEO Nicolas Aguzin rolling through Manhattan and Mayfair—not in a black limo, but in the back of a classic red Hong Kong cab. If Li Jia has his way, the next time one of those taxis makes an international cameo, it’ll be running on swappable power—a symbol not only of the city, but of the future of electric mobility. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ether Prices Reach A Fresh, 6-Month High Near $3,700
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/07/18/ether-prices-reach-a-fresh-6-month-high-near-3700/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T23:19:35Z
Full Content:
ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Ether prices reached a six-month high on July 18, fueled by multiple bullish factors. Ether prices rallied on Friday, July 18, approaching $3,700 and attaining their highest value since early January. The world’s second-most valuable digital currency by market value reached $3,677.40 during the day, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was trading at its loftiest price since approximately January 7. The ether token has been having a very strong month, rallying more than 50% after falling to as little as roughly $2,400 near the start of July, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal. When asked what fueled these latest gains, analysts who contributed input for this article highlighted several factors, including the recent legislative developments such as the government’s decision to approve the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act). The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O commented on this particular matter, stating that “Ethereum has been on an absolute tear recently. And I honestly think we can attribute most of it to the GENIUS Act getting approved and then of course, BlackRock filing to allow staking of Ethereum in their iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA).” Doug Colkitt, a founding contributor at Fogo, also weighed in, identifying several causal factors. “Ethereum is benefiting from a mix of structural and speculative drivers," he stated via email. “The rally is partly fueled by renewed momentum across DeFi and tokenized assets, which continue to build atop Ethereum’s infrastructure. On top of that, with Bitcoin dominance stretched, investors are rotating into other majors like ETH that offer strong narratives, robust developer activity, and room to run,” said Colkitt. “If ETF progress continues, Ethereum could be on the verge of a new capital influx cycle," he concluded. Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, also provided his take on ether’s latest price rally. “Ethereum is catching a wave of renewed institutional interest, driven by the broader tailwinds from ETF optimism and a rotation into high-beta assets,” he stated. “But under the hood, there’s also growing traction in the tokenization and L2 space, both of which are Ethereum-native narratives. As institutions begin allocating capital across more than just Bitcoin, Ethereum is naturally the next step, especially given its programmability and network effects across both DeFi and RWAs,” said Cahill. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, offered input on ether’s latest upside, citing a range of causal factors. “Ether’s rally toward $3,700 is being fueled by record inflows into spot ETH ETFs, with institutional investors showing renewed conviction,” he stated via email. “Regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act is also boosting sentiment, especially as Ethereum plays a central role in the stablecoin ecosystem. Add in whale accumulation and a strong technical breakout, and we’re seeing a surge that looks more sustainable than past speculative runs.” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives for digital asset data provider Amberdata, took a different tack than the other respondents, focusing on staking activity. “Today we have the highest ETH staking rate ever seen. About 30% of all ETH is now staked," he emphasized via email. "As Ethereum staking rates increase, the available liquid ETH remaining to trade is reduced (a smaller tradable float). Combine this phenomenon with ETH etf inflows, corporate treasury allocations and a longtime ETH underperformance and we get an explosive 'upside move,’” said Magadini. “Everyone is trying to buy at the same time!” he stressed. The crypto derivatives expert also spoke to the impact of regulatory developments, as well as supply-demand dynamics. “This week’s regulatory clarity and prospects for stablecoin adoption are great catalysts to create investment demand for ETH and other EVM based chains (65% of all USDC is on EVM chains), but the real key to explosive upside is the dynamics of increased demand with a simultaneous decrease in tradable supply," said Magadini. “There’s a lot of upside to ETH as the historical range of ETH prices to BTC prices ranges from 2% to 11% which implies ETH could rally from a low of $2,000 to $12,000 given Bitcoin’s current value,” he noted. One analyst in particular focused on investors rotating their capital from bitcoin into altcoins. When asked what fueled ether’s latest gains, Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, responded that “I think that it generally has to do with early signals that investors/traders are rotating part of their capital from Bitcoin to altcoins, as these coins reached extremely undervalued levels compared to Bitcoin.” “Purchases of ETH from US-based ETFs have outperformed purchases of Bitcoin. You can see this in the ratio of ETH to Bitcoin holdings of these ETFs,” he stated via Telegram. “The ratio has increased from 0.02 in April to 0.09 today." The chart below helps illustrate these developments: ETF: ETH/BTC Total Holdings Ratio “A similar dynamic can be observed in the relative spot trading volume ratio for these coins, which has been increasing in the same period, indicating higher growth in ETH trading activity than in Bitcoin,” he stated.

This week: We dig into who exactly is holding Strategy's Bitcoin billions, both Coinbase and Strategy rack up stock records, and more companies make crypto treasury moves. There isn’t a public list of the custodians holding Strategy’s $70 billion worth of Bitcoin. But there’s strong evidence that the SEC knows. And Strategy has said enough in public filings that we were able to put together a short list of potential custodians. Strategy appears to have told the SEC who custodies its Bitcoin in a 2023 response to an inquiry from the regulator. At the time, the industry was still reeling from FTX’s collapse and the resulting contagion that followed. And, more importantly, Silvergate Bank—which in 2022 lent Strategy $205 million to buy more Bitcoin, and held 34,619 BTC as collateral—had just shuttered. The SEC asked Strategy point-blank who it uses as custodians, strongly hinting that it was worried about the BTC held at Silvergate. Strategy answered, but invoked SEC Rule 83 to keep its list out of the public domain. But what it did say narrows the list down to 9 companies: BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company. Suffice it to say, Strategy still hasn’t replied to a request from Decrypt to comment on the matter. Coinbase and Strategy smashed through record highs this week, thanks to a crypto market that’s suddenly awash in fresh money. COIN hit multiple all-time high price marks over the course of the week, as analysts pointed to the surge in trading volume, the influx of ETF‑related inflows, and new custody deals as tailwinds. Now the firm has done it again to close out the week, finishing Friday at a new closing peak of $419.78 after hitting a new intraday peak of $444.65. The weekly surge came after Argus Research initiated coverage with a “buy” rating and $400 price target and JMP Securities doubled down on its “market outperform” reading. Rosenblatt also reiterated its buy rating on Thursday. Strategy—Michael Saylor’s unapologetic Bitcoin hoarder—hit its own all-time high market cap close on Wednesday as the company’s relentless buying spree pushed its holdings to 601,550 BTC. But MSTR hasn’t held onto its gains. On Friday, things weren’t so rosy for Strategy, with its stock falling more than 6% by close. Is it the Jim Cramer curse? The long-time crypto critic recently mentioned Strategy during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street”—but his comments were pretty cryptic. He recounted that someone approached him and asked if he “would be the figurehead” for a business “about, you know, one of the coins”—apparently referring to Bitcoin. He said he turned it down. “I was kind of like [JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon],” he said, “I’m kind of like lukewarm on that.” It’s difficult to go a day without hearing about a new crypto treasury company or an existing one adding to its coffers. And the investor response isn’t always to take the stock straight to the moon. This week was no exception. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Origin saw its share price spike after raising $500 million to start a Dogecoin treasury. The miner, which trades on the Nasdaq under the BTOG ticker, has been slow to come down off that high. As of Friday close, its stock was still changing hands for $0.78—nearly double the price it started the week at. Ethereum juggernaut Sharplink double dipped this week, picking up $48 million on Monday and then $225 million on Tuesday, and told the SEC on Thursday that it’s upsizing its $1 billion raise to $6 billion—all in the name of buying more ETH. Sharplink, which trades on the Nasdaq under the SBET ticker, has gained 16% since the start of the week. But it lost a whopping 20% off its share price in the past day and finished the day trading hands at $28.98 a share. There’s also a new Bitcoin treasury company in the mix. E-bike maker Volcon saw its shares soar 135% on Thursday as it said it plans to raise $500 million to start buying BTC. The shareholder euphoria was short-lived, though. On Friday, VLCN shares finished the day trading for $17.11 after falling by nearly 21%. No gray area. OG crypto asset manager Grayscale has made its intentions clear: The firm has filed preliminary paperwork that could lead to an IPO as the industry basks in a resurgence of interest in IPOs. But so far, the S-1 is still in draft mode while the firm, the issuer of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, works out the kinks. High stakes. Perhaps you’ve heard it’s ETH szn? Seen an altcoin ticker tape parade? Maybe heard the rumble of XRP Army troop movements? On Wall Street, the altcoin jubilee has iShares Ethereum Trust issuer BlackRock yearning for the ability to stake the nearly $8 billion worth of ETH it holds. Bad news: The SEC isn’t due to start issuing verdicts on staking for Ethereum ETFs until October.

July 18, 2025 16:39 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, July 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. ("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that:(i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon;(ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors;(iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions;(iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability;(v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and(vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company. On this news, shares fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Title: President Trump Officially Signs The GENIUS Stablecoin Act Into Law, BlackRock Is Now Buying 5x More Ethereum As Bitcoin

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. In a seminal development, President Trump has now officially signed the GENIUS stablecoin act, more formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, into law. This marks the first time the US has enacted a significant crypto-focused law. The GENIUS Act passed 308-122. pic.twitter.com/ijVebDHua6 The legislation stumbled earlier this week when some House members raised concerns regarding the supposed lacunae within the GENIUS stablecoin act, including its failure to safeguard self-custody of crypto assets, as well as the lack of a formal preclusion of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). President Trump then invited some of the discenting members to the White House, ultimately managing to win over 11 out of the 12 additional Congress members required to ensure the passage of the act. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GENIUS stablecoin act creates a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Among other things, it mandates that stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar have to be backed by eligible reserves - consisting of US Treasuries with maturities of 93 days or less, US dollars, or similar liquid assets - on a 1:1 basis. The legislation also requires regular reserve audits and monthly disclosures. Large stablecoin issuers, with a market cap of $50 billion or more, will be subjected to an annual financial audit. Under the proposed framework, banks and other eligible entities can issue stablecoins without the onerous requirements entailed under securities laws. However, all issuers will have to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including rules pertaining to the so-called Know Your Customer (KYC) framework. The law also prioritizes a stablcoin holder's claims to the issuer's reserves over the claims of creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. The law also prevents domestic and foreign issuers of stablecoins from offering interest to the holders of these coins. The GENIUS stablecoin act is expected to provide a major boost to the USD-pegged stablecoins, with the sector's TAM expected to grow from around $240 billion right now to $750 billion by the end of 2026. Of course, the House has also passed two other bills in what was widely dubbed as the Crypto Week: the anti-CBDC Act and the Clarity Act, which formally divides regulatory jurisdiction over the crypto sector between the SEC and CFTC and creates a framework for consumer protection. Both of these bills are now headed to the Senate. BLACKROCK IS STILL BUYING MORE ETH THAN BTCBlackRock’s purchase of over half a billion dollars of ETH ($547M) exceeded its Bitcoin inflow ($497M) by $50 Million USD.Weighted by market cap, BlackRock is buying over 5 TIMES the amount of ETH compared to BTC. pic.twitter.com/fnvjvKXQ0N Meanwhile, in what constitutes a significant development, the asset management titan BlackRock is now manifestly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This suggests a new altcoin mania might be at hand. Under the GENIUS stablecoin law, stablecoin issuers must procure either a federal or state license to operate. The federal licenses have to be procured from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Of course, small stablecoin issuers - with a market cap of under $10 billion - can opt for either a state or federal license. However, this choice is not available to larger issuers, who are mandated to seek federal licenses under the GENIUS stablecoin law. The chosen regulator has to decide on a given application within 120 days. As a part of the licensing framework, applicants must demonstrate sufficient capitalization and their possession of liquid, high quality reserves on a 1:1 basis representing a 100 percent backing of all issued stablecoins, robust internal control mechanisms, and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) rules and regulations. Bear in mind that existing stablecoin issuers such as Circle have a grace period to ensure compliance with the law. GENIUS stablecoin law becomes effective at the earliest of either 18 months after its passage or 120 days after final regulations are issued. Ths biggest loser under the law is Tether, which is a foreign issuer and can't legally distribute it's USDT stablecoin the US now. As such, non-compliant stablecoins have to be phased out within 3 years. Tether can, however, create a new US-based subsidiary or partner with an approved stablecoin issuer to maintain its footprint in the US. Of course, Tether's biggest backer is the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, whose former chairman, Howard Lutnick, is the current US Treasury Secretary. So, there is hope yet for Tether. Big Tech also loses under the GENIUS stablecoin law as these companies - which are not primarily involved in the financial services sphere - will now have to win a unanimous approval from the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee - comprised of the Treasury Secretary (chair), the Fed Chair/Vice Chair for Supervision, and the FDIC Chair - to issue their bespoke stablecoins.

Title: Wall Street backs Ethereum as ETH stablecoin dominance hits 54%

From stablecoins to staking, ETH is becoming the reserve asset of the onchain economy. Ethereum is gaining momentum with a 20% rally, driven by U.S. policy support, growing DeFi demand, and major institutional treasury allocations. Falling Bitcoin dominance and rising Ethereum activity hint at an incoming altseason led by ETH. Ethereum [ETH] is back in the spotlight – and this time, Wall Street is watching closely. As stablecoin adoption soars and real-world assets go on-chain, ETH is emerging as more than just a utility token. Ethereum is no longer just the foundation for DeFi and NFTs – it’s fast becoming Wall Street’s on-chain reserve. With over 54% of stablecoins issued on Ethereum and billions in tokenized real-world assets settling on its network, ETH is now seen as digital collateral akin to Treasuries or gold. These developments come as BlackRock filed to add staking to its Ethereum ETFs. From Fidelity to Electric Capital, institutions increasingly treat Ethereum as a sovereign financial layer where ETH is the reserve asset. Its role in collateralization, settlement, and staking-backed yield positions it as the backbone of the emerging digital dollar economy, reshaping how TradFi views and uses blockchain infrastructure. After months of Bitcoin dominance climbing steadily since December 2024, the tide may be turning. BTC dominance recently broke below a key threshold; mirroring patterns seen ahead of prior altseason bursts. Source: X In previous market cycles, a drop in Bitcoin dominance often led to a capital rotation into altcoins, with Ethereum typically leading the charge. Now, Ethereum is up 20% in the past week, outperforming Bitcoin. Its daily active addresses and transaction volume have hit record highs, signaling strong network engagement. This divergence, combined with falling Bitcoin dominance, suggests a potential regime shift in the crypto market. Historically, Ethereum’s strength has triggered broader altcoin rallies. If momentum continues, this breakout could be the start of a new altcoin season. Ethereum’s recent rally isn’t just driven by market momentum—it’s backed by real catalysts. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, pointed to the impact of U.S. legislation like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts, stating: “GENIUS targets yield-bearing stablecoins, and this is great news for Ethereum-based DeFi.” Institutional confidence is also rising. SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, added $225 million in ETH to its treasury. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, backed by Peter Thiel, has pivoted to Ethereum reserves, now holding over $500 million in ETH. Puckrin believes Ethereum is gaining serious traction: “Momentum is clearly on Ethereum’s side,” he said, projecting a near-term test of $4,000. Still, he offered a word of caution: “What goes up must come down.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Time Published: 2025-07-18T18:40:30Z

🍃 Announcing molab: run and share marimo notebooks in the cloud, for free marimo team @marimo_io molab is a cloud-hosted marimo notebook workspace that lets you rapidly experiment on data using Python and SQL. We’re giving molab (mo for marimo) to you, our community, for free. To create your first notebook, visit https://molab.marimo.io. To get inspired, check out example notebooks on visualizing embeddings, calling LLM inference providers with HuggingFace by Vaibhav Srivastav from Hugging Face, annotating data with W&B Weave by Scott Condron from W&B, and more. Highlights. Create your first notebook by navigating to https://molab.marimo.io. If this is your first-time using molab, you’ll be prompted to create an account. Each notebook runs in an environment with several popular packages pre-installed, including torch, numpy, polars, and more. marimo’s built-in package manager will install additional packages as you import them, using uv. As packages are installed, an associated pyproject.toml file is updated, keeping a record of your notebook’s dependencies. In the near future, we plan to add support for syncing these dependencies, so that the next time you start your notebook it will run with the dependencies you installed. To get a shareable link, click the link icon in the top-right. Notebooks are public but undiscoverable. Notebooks get persistent storage; view the file tree by clicking the file icon in the sidebar. From here you can upload additional data files, which are stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. You can download the notebook directory by clicking the download button, also on the top-right. To run your notebook locally after downloading it, install uv then use uv run marimo edit notebook.py To download the notebook locally, just pass the notebook URL to marimo edit. For example: Today, this brings just the notebook file down, and does not include your attached storage. We launched marimo last year on HackerNews, after incubating it at Stanford and tech startups. Since then, marimo has been downloaded over four million times, with over 300k monthly downloads, blown past Jupyter in GitHub stars (14.5k and counting!), and has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies, cutting-edge startups, and research institutes alike for ML, AI, data engineering, data science, and more. Along the way, our company was backed by the best investors in data. While you can use marimo locally (just pip install marimo), many of you have told us how valuable a marimo-powered Colab-like service would be for running machine learning and AI workloads. In fact, the most popular recent feature request in Google Colab’s issue tracker asks for marimo support in Colab: Rather than try to convince Google to replace their notebook with marimo, we decided to just build molab instead. marimo is a modern notebook for modern data workflows, so it’s only fitting that we built molab on a modern tech stack: Making the next generation of interactive computing accessible to everyone. In addition to reinventing the Python notebook, we’re also on a mission to make marimo accessible to anyone with an internet connection. That’s why we launched support for WebAssembly notebooks last year, making it possible to run lightweight notebooks entirely in the browser (of course, you can also run marimo on your laptop, on cloud servers, or anywhere you can run software). But while our WebAssembly playground makes snappy interactive compute widely available, it is limited in the packages it supports and the computation it can exploit. molab is our next step in democratizing the next generation of interactive computing: backed by cloud computing, molab lets you create and share notebooks that use any Python package and that run on powerful hardware. We have a lot more planned for molab, but for now — please try it out, share feedback, and have fun making awesome notebooks! What’s the difference between molab and Google Colab? Google Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service provider. molab is a hosted marimo notebook service with similar compute and sharing capabilities, but powered by marimo notebooks instead of Jupyter. Is molab marimo’s enterprise product? No. If you’re interested in a next-generation data platform for modern AI and data workloads — with marimo’s trademark developer experience, complete with security and governance required for enterprises — get in touch. I’m behind the times, what’s marimo? marimo is an open-source reactive notebook for Python that is designed specifically for working with data. marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python (version with Git), shareable as data apps, executable as scripts or pipelines, reproducible in execution and packaging, have SQL built-in, and make it easy to connect to your own databases and data lakes. marimo has no dependencies on Jupyter or IPython, and is built entirely from scratch. marimo was originally developed with input from scientists at Stanford and developers in industry. With over 300k monthly downloads and 14k GitHub stars, it is now used broadly at companies like Cloudflare, BlackRock, Shopify, OpenAI, and Hugging Face, and universities like Stanford and Berkeley. Is molab free? molab is currently free to use, as long as usage is reasonable. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for our community to use marimo notebooks. How do I get more RAM, CPU or GPUs? Reach out to us and we’ll see what we can do! I’m a compute provider. How do I get plugged into molab as an offered backend? Get in touch. How does molab relate to marimo’s open source notebook? molab is a hosted version of marimo’s open source notebook. You can use marimo on your own machine or on your own remote servers. How does molab relate to marimo’s WebAssembly playground? The WebAssembly playground runs notebooks entirely in the browser through Pyodide. This makes for a snappy user experience, at the cost of limited compute and limited support for Python packages. The playground is well-suited for lightweight notebooks and embedding interactive notebooks in documentation, but it is not well-suited for modern ML or AI workflows. molab is currently entirely separate from the WebAssembly playground. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. How does molab relate to marimo’s community cloud? Our community cloud provides a place to organize and share WebAssembly notebooks. molab is currently entirely separate from the community cloud. In the future we may merge them into a unified experience. © 2025 Marimo Inc. All rights reserved.

Title: Ham Radio Users Clash With Starlink Rival AST SpaceMobile Over Spectrum Use

AST SpaceMobile and its giant satellites are facing opposition from a surprising group: Amateur "ham" radio operators. The community is protesting AST SpaceMobile's request to use the 430 to 440MHz band, which includes spectrum already allocated for ham radio operations, including emergency communications. An amateur radio operator in Germany named Mario Lorenz is asking the US Federal Communication Commission to deny AST's proposal to use the spectrum outside the US. “AST seeks worldwide access to a significant portion of this spectrum in a way which would almost guarantee significant international harmful interference,” Lorenz says. Texas-based AST wants to use the spectrum outside the US to track and control its proposed fleet of 248 satellites, which promise to deliver internet connectivity to everyday smartphones in cellular dead zones. However, Lorenz claims AST’s application is “vague” and lacks details about how it’ll harness the spectrum and avoid interference with ham radio operators. Thus, in a worst-case scenario, the proposal is an "unprecedented grab of spectrum, and in violation of applicable Radio Regulations," Lorenz told the FCC. "Unlike Amateur Radio stations in the US, who have a much larger 70cm allocation (420 MHz ...450 MHz) and other bands (220 MHz) not available to Amateur Radio stations in Region 1 (Europe), amateur radio activity is much more concentrated,” he added. “The 70cm band is heavily used. It is one of the few bands available to Novice class operators in Germany.” Since then, other ham radio users have been rallying the community and sending complaints to the FCC, warning about the risk of interference. “Amateur radio has a proven track record of saving lives in wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters,” said another user. "It is widely used for public-service events, community coordination, search-and-rescue, and auxiliary communications for local agencies when all else fails.” The complaints arrive as the FCC has kicked off a process to review and possibly greenlight AST’s proposal to power a commercial satellite-to-phone service through the company’s emerging satellite constellation. AST currently has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, but plans to launch dozens of larger second-generation satellites in the coming months and years to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the turf battle highlights how next-generation satellite constellations can rankle existing services by harnessing radio spectrum already in use. SpaceX, for example, has been waging a regulatory battle to use the radio spectrum that Globalstar and EchoStar currently rely on in an effort to bolster the cellular Starlink service for T-Mobile. AST’s application to the FCC shows it plans on using different radio frequencies to track and control the satellites in the US. The company also notes the FCC cleared it to use the 430 to 440MHz radio bands for its first five BlueBird satellites. But in his letter to the FCC, Lorenz argued: “With a planned total of 248 satellites in orbit, almost certainly there would always be one or more satellites in view, causing significantly more interference potential. “At the very least, the FCC should require from AST a clear showing and commitment to protect the Amateur Radio and Amateur Radio Satellite services,” he added.

But in his letter to the FCC, Lorenz argued: “With a planned total of 248 satellites in orbit, almost certainly there would always be one or more satellites in view, causing significantly more interference potential. “At the very least, the FCC should require from AST a clear showing and commitment to protect the Amateur Radio and Amateur Radio Satellite services,” he added.

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time.

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

I’m using it in my CPA practice recently and I find it extremely helpful tool and its uses going to help me increase my fees and decrease my time a win-win Sell Microsoft? Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. You should use real intelligence to construct a coherent sentence. I don’t think the issue is the efficacy of AI, the issue is too many AI engines, and start ups centered around them, which has led to too much investment concentrated in the category. Use one company’s AI to vet the work product of another company’s AI—while you take a nap! Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

"So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money.

Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get.

Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. 19 posted on 07/18/2025 11:38:15 AM PDT by roadcat ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: TexasGator What?

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds. In practice, it is GIGO. The slopes of the NVDA and PLTR charts are reminiscent of late 1999. “In practice, it is GIGO.” Like some people! Is there a market bubble in AI company valuations? Yup. I’m using it in my CPA practice recently and I find it extremely helpful tool and its uses going to help me increase my fees and decrease my time a win-win Sell Microsoft? Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. You should use real intelligence to construct a coherent sentence. I don’t think the issue is the efficacy of AI, the issue is too many AI engines, and start ups centered around them, which has led to too much investment concentrated in the category. Use one company’s AI to vet the work product of another company’s AI—while you take a nap!

Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation.

Given the technology spawned by the silicon chip, the issuing, trading of stocks, bonds and securities, the supporting legal, printing and bankong services no longer requires people situated in a physical “financial district”. Virtually all the business can be conducted via the internet and virtual, instant telecommunications. Why would a businessman wish to locate in a hostile, crime tolerant, high tax area? His competitors will be much more profitable in places like Florida.

Title: Lido rallies 21%, hits 2-month high – Can LDO bulls hold on?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/lido-rallies-21-hits-2-month-high-can-ldo-bulls-hold-on/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T17:00:59Z
Full Content:
LIDO DAO surges 21% to a 2 months high as investors rush into the market following Blackrock’s filing of ETHA staking LIDO surged 21.53% hitting $1.15, then retraced to $1.13. Buyers rushed into the market following Blackrock’s filing for ETHA staking, scooping up over 60 million tokens. Lido [LDO] rallied 21.53% reaching a 2-month high of $1.15 before slightly retracing to $1.13 by press time. As a result, the altcoin’s market cap reclaimed $1 billion mark for the first time in two months. At the same time, its trading volume surged 219.9% to $471 million, reflecting growing demand and network activity. But what triggered the surge? According to AMBCrypto, the price uptick is in part driven by BlackRock’s recent filing to add staking to its Ethereum ETF [ETHA]. This move is significant for Lido because staking mainly happens through LDO. Thus, all ETH staking processes will run through LDO, something that most market participants have interpreted as a bullish signal. Significantly, this move to stake ETH through a third party could boost demand for Lido’s stETH derivatives, thus enhancing POS. Following BlackRock’s filing, investors rushed into the market to accumulate the altcoin. According to Coinalyze, Lido Dao saw 48.6 million in Buy Volume compared to 45.7 million in Sell Volume on July 17th. At the time of writing, the altcoin recorded 15.3 million in Buy Volume relative to 13.4 million in Sell Volume. As a result, the altcoin experienced two consecutive days of positive Buy-Sell Delta, at 2.8 and 1.8 million, respectively. Typically, a higher buy volume indicates strong market conviction as investors shift to aggressive accumulation. Unsurprisingly, as LDO prices rallied, so did the profit-taking urge by holders and investors in equal measures. Spot Netflow hiked to a 6-month high of $5.2 million before dropping to $2.77 million as of this writing. Source: CoinGlass A high Netflow implies increased Exchange Inflow compared to Outflow, a clear sign of aggressive selling. For that reason, Lido Finance’s scarcity has been evidenced by the declining Stock-to-Flow Ratio. According to Santiment, SFR declined to 26.4, reflecting an increase in LDO available for immediate sale on Exchanges. Source: Santiment Typically, a lower scarcity precedes lower prices amid mounting downward pressure on an asset. According to AMBCrypto’s analysis, Lido saw a strong uptrend as buyers rushed into the market following good news. As a result, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged to 78, at press time, touching overbought territory. At the same time, DMI spiked to 41, indicating strong upward momentum and its potential for continuation. Source: TradingView When these momentum indicators are configured in this manner, they suggest that Lido may continue to make gains. That said, if buyers can hold on and continue accumulating, LDO could target $1.4. However, profit takers pose a threat to the continued uptrend, and if they overwhelm buyers, a pullback is likely to follow. If LDO faces rejection here, the altcoin will find support around $0.97.

Title: Netflix Shares Tumble 5% Despite Strong 2nd Quarter Earnings Report
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-stock-reaction-earnings-q2-2025/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T15:11:54Z
Full Content:
While Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish, one analyst argued the streamer’s results and raised guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations” Despite Netflix’s strong beat on earnings on Thursday, it wasn’t good enough for some Wall Street investors as shares are down more than 5% on Friday. The streamer posted a 16% increase in revenue to $11.08 billion and 45.6% jump in profits to $3.13 billion in its second quarter of 2025, primarily driven by more subscribers, higher pricing and increased ad revenue. It also raised its 2025 revenue outlook from $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, up from previous guidance of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, reflecting healthy subscriber growth and ad sales and the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. The update represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. Though William Blair analyst Ralph Shackart touted a “good quarter and positive tone that business trends remain strong,” he argued the results and guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations.” “The above-the-Street revenue guide was due in part to a weaker dollar. The outlook for Netflix remains positive in our view, with a strong slate, a broadeningadvertising platform, solid retention, price changes in line with expectations, and stable engagement,” Shackart wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe it will retain pricing power over the long term.” Seaport Research’s David Joyce, who remains neutral on the stock with no price target, added that shares “appear close to fully-valuing the current opportunity sets discounted through 2030.” He acknowledged Netflix can find additional upside with advertising and more price increases, but said it would “take time to become evident.” Others were more bullish, such as Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich who raised her price target on the stock to $1,490 per share and reiterated a buy rating. “In our view, Netflix shares will be fueled by continued positive subscriber and earnings momentum in addition to evolving advertising and live opportunities,” she wrote in a Friday note to clients. “Supported by its world-class brand, leading global subscriber scale, position as an innovator and increased visibility in growth drivers, we believe that Netflix will continue to outperform.” MoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman, who maintained a buy rating and raised their price target to $1,400 per share, expect Netflix to continue to disrupt the pay TV ecosystem over time and that it will increase spending as it expands into live event and sports content as well as its in-house advertising technology platform. “We believe the [return on investment] from these moves will lead to even greatermargin expansion and faster earnings growth,” they said. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion, who raised his price target to $1,500 per share, continues to see Netflix as a “defensive name with multiple upside levers.” He expects the company’s content slate to improve in the back half of 2025 and thinks the company’s guidance “bakes in conservatism.” J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth added that he believes the ad-supported tier will further expand the company’s subscriber base while driving high-margin incremental revenue, projecting 60 million ad tier subscribers by the end of 2025.But he acknowledged that after “significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced,” leading him to remain neutral on Netflix stock and establish a price target of $1,300 per share. Netflix stock is up 87% in the past year and 36% year to date. Shares are currently trading at $1,205.96, off its 52-week high of $1,341.15.

It’s ego-centric. It’s not a policy shift in the traditional sense. Trump is attempting to reassert dominance after concluding that Putin is no longer playing by his rules.

Greece has dismissed the claims as legally void, but the timing reflects growing alignment between Khalifa Haftar’s eastern bloc in Libya and Turkish strategic aims, despite earlier being staunch enemies. Haftar is now positioning himself as a gatekeeper to offshore gas corridors and international recognition. With Turkey’s foreign minister engaging at the UN on Cyprus, Libya’s new maritime push creates leverage for Ankara on multiple fronts: it pressures Greece, undercuts Egypt’s quiet coordination with Haftar’s rivals in Tripoli, and signals continued Turkish reach in Mediterranean maritime negotiations. The note verbale is unlikely to result in enforcement but reshapes the legal-political map enough to keep energy and boundary negotiations unsettled, and both Ankara and Haftar benefit from this ambiguity. Discovery & Development ConocoPhillips is ramping up oil exploration in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, aiming to drill four wells and run seismic surveys over 300 square miles this winter. The push comes as the company looks beyond the $7B Willow project, which is set to start flowing 180,000 bpd by 2029. New activity is backed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump, mandating at least five lease sales and a rollback to Trump-era rules. Conoco sees Alaska as a long-term oil play with 8.7 billion barrels still on the table. Azule Energy, the BP–Eni joint venture, just struck gas in Angola’s first-ever exploration well dedicated solely to gas. Drilled in Block 1/14 of the Lower Congo Basin, the Gajajeira-01 well hit pay with over 1 Tcf of gas and 100 million barrels of condensate, according to early estimates. The find is being called a turning point for Angola’s gas ambitions, which have long played second fiddle to oil. Azule operates the block with 35%, alongside Equinor (30%), Sonangol (25%), and local firm Acrep (10%). Aker BP hit more oil in Norway’s North Sea, confirming two out of five targets at its Omega Alfa well in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery adds to rising volumes there, with recoverables now pegged at 700 MMboe, up from 650 MMboe after folding in the East Frigg Beta/Epsilon find. Yggdrasil’s first oil is still expected in 2027, but cost estimates have climbed to $12.1B. Meanwhile, pipelay and topsides construction are advancing fast, and the company’s broader North Sea and Norwegian Sea projects—including Valhall, Alvheim, Johan Sverdrup, and Skarv Satellites—are all pushing toward fresh output over the next two years. CNOOC has made another major find in the Beibu Gulf, striking a 211-meter oil and gas pay zone at its WZ10-5S-2d well—its second big hit in the area after the earlier 283-meter pay at WZ10-5-1Sa. The new well, drilled to 3,362 meters, is the first major breakthrough in China’s offshore exploration of metamorphic sandstone and slate buried hills. Initial flows hit 400 bpd of crude and 165 Mcf/d of gas, reinforcing CNOOC’s bet on deep play and buried hill formations. The company says this opens the door to large-scale exploration in mature basins like Beibu, with more production gains likely in the pipeline. Chevron is backing a $100M exploration push in Peru’s offshore Block Z-62, partnering with Anadarko after seismic studies revealed signs of a new oil and gas field. The block, located off La Libertad and Lambayeque, could help Peru close its hydrocarbon trade gap—currently importing double the diesel it produces. The plan includes drilling five exploratory and ten confirmatory wells–a significant step in boosting domestic output. Peru’s energy ministry is framing the project as a critical step toward energy security and long-overdue reactivation of its oil and gas sector. Equinor’s wildcat well 34/6-8 S in the North Sea’s Garantiana NV prospect came up dry, with no hydrocarbons found in the Cook Formation target. The well, drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic rig, hit 105 meters of Cook Formation but encountered only water-bearing sandstone. It’s the eighth well in PL 554 and has now been permanently plugged and abandoned. This follows another dry hole at the Lit prospect, though Equinor did recently score a gas find at its Skred prospect in the Barents Sea. Assam is now the first state in India with a direct stake in crude production, following a hydrocarbon discovery at the Namrup Borhat-1 well. Through a likely 10% interest via Assam Hydrocarbon and Energy Co., the state will share in both the revenue and risk alongside Oil India Ltd. (OIL). Assam already ranks #3 in India’s onshore crude output, but this shift from royalty recipient to equity partner puts it in a new league. Chief Minister Sarma called it a milestone for energy security and a signal that Assam is done playing a passive role in India’s oil story. BlackRock is leading a group set to invest around $10B in Saudi Aramco’s massive Jafurah gas project, marking another pipeline-style leaseback deal. Like Aramco’s 2021 infrastructure transactions, the group won’t own the assets outright—Aramco keeps control while paying tariffs to investors for using the pipelines and processing facilities. Jafurah is Aramco’s $100B shale gas bet, touted as the largest non-U.S. shale project, and key to boosting Saudi gas output 60% by 2030. For Saudi Arabia, it’s another way to cash in on energy assets without relinquishing control, while shoring up funds for economic diversification. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions SLB just locked in final approval for its $7.8B merger with ChampionX after the UK’s CMA signed off on a package of divestitures aimed at easing monopoly fears. The deal—delayed for months by regulatory scrutiny—will close Wednesday, giving SLB new firepower in production chemicals and drilling services. To get it done, SLB and ChampionX agreed to offload overlapping UK assets, sell ChampionX’s US Synthetic unit, and license quartz sensor tech to competitors. Norway's competition authority had already greenlit the deal in April, clearing the last real hurdle. Perenco has wrapped up its acquisition of Woodside’s Greater Angostura assets in Trinidad & Tobago, securing operatorship of offshore fields producing 50,000 boepd. The deal includes stakes in the 2(C) and 3(A) PSCs plus an onshore terminal, and pushes Perenco’s T&T output above 100,000 boepd. The move deepens its foothold in the region and boosts gas output to over 500 mscfd. Perenco says it's banking on its expertise in mature fields to extend the life of Angostura while backing T&T’s economic growth. To access this exclusive content...

Why, pray tell, would the nation’s biggest public pension fund that also runs its own health insurance program hire a general counsel with no experience whatsoever in investment management, financial regulatory compliance, insurance, government public disclosure and other state agency requirements, and instead had been a private sector criminal defense attorney? Oh, and by credible rumor, one who was looking for a new gig because he wasn’t generating fees at the level that his law firm expected of partners? Hiring a crook-protector like Matt Jacobs as general counsel sure looked like a statement of CalPERS’ ‘intent to engage in less than savory conduct. Shortly after she joined CalPERS as CEO, Marcie Frost asked to meet us for dinner. She reneged when she realized I intended to treat the discussion on the record. At the time, I told her she should fire Jacobs. The Matt Jacobs rap sheet below shows our recommendation to have been well warranted. These and many more posts document either his complicity in trying to cover up rather than correct CalPERS’ bad actions, or his direct role in dereliction of duty, above all in making sure CalPERS had adequate controls and procedures. So we can take only a tiny bit of comfort from the fact that Matt Jacobs is retiring at the end of this month. It should have happened a long time ago. Remember this is only a partial list.

From CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng Resigns Following Our Exposing His False, Felonious Financial Disclosure Filings and Private Equity Conflicts of Interest: CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ben Meng resigned effective Wednesday August 5. This was less than three days after we exposed Meng having made multiple felonious1 false statements on financial disclosure forms as well as holding investments in private equity firms when CalPERS was making multi-hundred-billion dollar commitments to them.2 Since Meng was seen in the office in routine internal meetings Wednesday morning, it appears his departure was not voluntary. We were also first to break the story of his resignation, via Twitter; you can read the press release here: We have from two sources that CalPERS CIO Ben Meng has submitted his resignation, presumably due to: https://t.co/mnfZHyd0eG — Yves Smith (@yvessmith) August 6, 2020 This outcome was a self-inflicted wound. Remember that the Forms 700 that exposed Meng’s misconduct went first to CalPERS, which then sends them to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Apparently no one reviewed the documents, much the less suggested Meng correct them, even though CalPERS’ written policy is that the Form 700 is to be submitted in time so that the employee’s supervisor, which in Meng’s case was CEO Marcie Frost, can review it. Apparently, no one checked the Form 700 against Meng’s trading records, which CalPERS should also have on file. Apparently, no one even told Meng to amend his form when CalPERS was about to post it on CalPERS’ site. And we will see when we get the results of our Public Records Act request, but it appears likely that CalPERS did not require Meng to recuse himself on private equity investment pitches from the firms whose stocks he held: Ares, Blackstone, and Carlyle…. CalPERS accelerated its decay when it chose a white-collar defense attorney, Matt Jacobs, as General Counsel in 2014. Despite having sworn an oath to defend the laws of California and having constitutional duties that make protecting beneficiaries paramount, Jacobs clearly sees his job as shielding the executive team. And that has included thwarting board members in making what at any well-functioning institution would be non-controversial inquiries, like getting senior management resignation letters, copies of procedure manuals, minutes of closed session board meetings, and internal audit reports. Jacobs has repeatedly sullied CalPERS by regularly telling falsehoods in public, which is toxic model for an institution’s top compliance officer. The examples are too numerous to catalogue in full… Needless to say, this conduct is deeply corrosive. It telegraphs to employees that something is deeply wrong. People whose job it to tell the truth think there is no payoff for doing the right thing, only punishment. This message has been powerfully reinforced by Frost and Meng forcing out some of the few remaining competent executives: Elisabeth Bourqui, apparently for questioning a “private equity new business model” that eventually died under the weight of its own contradictions, and then two highly regarded investment professionals, Ron Legnado and Paul Mouchakka. Yet the CalPERS board, unwilling to look at its own culpability in this run of escalating scandals, chooses to blame commies under the bed, um, supposed pension haters. In fact, as we have catalogued, these transgressions were all unforced errors that merely adequate oversight would have prevented. There would be almost no bad stories about CalPERS if CalPERS didn’t keep generating them. Although CalPEERS has some competition from the disastrously underfunded and deeply corrupt Kentucky Retirement System, CalPERS under Marcie Frost has done more to damage the image of public pension funds in the US than any other force. From Criminality, CalPERS Style: Board Members Misappropriate Public Funds by Signing Blank, Undated Expense Forms: Pictures really can be worth a thousand words. The images below and related evidence demonstrate conclusively that many, perhaps most, CalPERS board members have been filing fraudulent expense forms on a regular basis, some over a period of years. This is a written policy, codified in CalPERS’ board manual and is clearly intended to circumvent California state requirements. The Board Services Unit, which reports to the Board President, asks board members to pre-sign blank sheets of paper with just a blank signature line printed on them. The Board Services Unit later prints onto that signed blank page the body of the travel claim form, with the dollar amounts and date filled in, and submits it on board members’ behalf. Importantly, the form that CalPERS board members have been endorsing in blank requires the signature to certify a statement contained immediately above the signature that validates the accuracy of the information submitted on of the form. As you can see in one of the photos below, that certification is deliberately omitted from the nearly blank page that the board members sign in advance…. As Andrew Silton, former Chief Investment Officer for North Carolina, said by e-mail: There’s a pretty simple rule in the realm of public pension management. You don’t sign blank signature pages whether it’s an investment management contract or an expenditure report. During my tenure as CIO for North Carolina we sometimes had to go to great lengths to get entire contracts and reports into the hands of the State Treasurer (the sole fiduciary) because he had to know what he was signing. Whether he was committing the pension to a multi-million dollar contract or requesting reimbursement for a few hundred dollars of travel expenses, he was drawing funds that belong to the pension trust. His signature, and at times my signature, had to be attached to completed documents. Filling out expenditure reports was often a cumbersome task, and I needed help on numerous occasions to get the figures into the correct boxes on North Carolina’s expenditure form. So I suppose it would have been convenient to just sign a bunch of blank forms and dump a stack of receipts on someone’s desk. Aside from violating the law, this would have sent a terrible signal to staff and invited abuse. Travel expenditures are a precious commodity in pension management. They allow fiduciaries and staff to perform proper due diligence. When abuses are unearthed (e.g. padding expense reports) public pensions tend to crack down. Not only is the abuse addressed, but legitimate travel is also curtailed. The board of CalPERS shouldn’t need any training or lawyers to help them understand the importance of protecting the expenditure process. It’s amazing to me that all but a few board members at CalPERS seem to have no qualms about signing blank expenditure forms. Once again, it appears that senior staff rather than the board is in control at CalPERS… On January 15, the day before Margaret Brown’s first day as a board member at CalPERS, she attended an orientation meeting with fellow incoming board member David Miller. Members of the Board Services Unit, all but one of whom are relatively low-level administrative staff, led the briefing. They gave Brown a raft of forms to sign and hand back to them. This is what she was given: Brown signed them in front of staff before saying she wanted to look at them some more and took the folder with the signed copies with her. She did not return them…. Note that the certification language that sits right above the signature line has been omitted from the blank form Brown was asked to sign: I HEREBY CERTIFY That the above is a true statement of the travel expenses incurred by me in accordance with DPA rules in the service of the State of California. If a privately owned vehicle was used, and if mileage rates exceed the minimum rate, I certify that the cost of operating the vehicle was equal to or greater than the rate claimed, and that I have met the requirements as prescribed by SAM Sections 0750, 0751, 0752, 0753 and 0754 pertaining to vehicle safety and seatbelt usage. And it is no accident that Brown and Miller were asked to sign about 20 copies of each form. This is a page from the CalPERS Board Manual: As the images show, the Board Services Unit instructs board members sign undated forms in blank, with the body of the form, including critically, the certification language removed.1 Staff prints the rest of the form, including the missing certification language, into the pre-signed document when they also fill in expense information and submit it on behalf of the board member… The implication of the institutionalized practice of: 1) using pre-signed partial forms, 2) using them to fabricate documents that are falsely submitted as complete originals, and 3) using them as the basis for making of payment is that the current Board President, Priya Mathur, her predecessor, Rob Feckner, and members of the Board Services Unit have suborned board members to provide false certifications on an ongoing basis. In addition, both the pre-signing of the travel claim forms and the submission of the false certifications is criminal conduct. Per Title 12 OF CRIMES AGAINST THE REVENUE AND PROPERTY OF THIS STATE, Section 424: (a) Each officer of this state, or of any county, city, town, or district of this state, and every other person charged with the receipt, safekeeping, transfer, or disbursement of public moneys, who either: 3. Knowingly keeps any false account, or makes any false entry or erasure in any account of or relating to the same; or, 4. Fraudulently alters, falsifies, conceals, destroys, or obliterates any account; Section 424(a)3 is colloquially called the “misappropriation of public funds” statute. Merely providing a “false account,” as in false certifications or doctored records, is a crime in and of itself. In addition, Chapter 8 of the California Government Code makes conspiracy a crime, and defines it broadly in Section 182: (a) If two or more persons conspire: (1) To commit any crime. This means that not only have the “officers of the state” meaning Board Presidents Mathur and Feckner, along with any board members who pre-signed travel expense forms, apparently misappropriated public funds as defined under the law, but they and the members of the Board Services Unit who prepared and submitted the forms also look to have committed an additional felony, that of conspiracy. Summarizing from this detailed post: Brown voiced her concern about this practice to a board member who was also an attorney, who confirmed that no one should ever sign a blank form. Matt Jacobs overheard the discussion, said it was improper and needed to stop, and said he would speak to Board President Priya Mathur about it. Whatever Jacobs said to Mathur was apparently unserious. Rather than Mathur halting the practice and telling board members pronto that new procedures were to be implemented, Mathur scheduled a call with Brown. Brown e-mailed Mathur and told her about the practice and why she was concerned about it. Mathur replied by e-mail she would look into it and get back to Brown. As we described in the post, Brown did not hear back and there was no evidence any corrective action was taken at the time our post ran, months later. So Jacobs couldn’t be bothered to pressure Mathur to fix something so obviously improper yet easy to remedy. This incident may help readers will understand the disgust with which I view his, Marcie Frost, and many other board members’ lazy, corrupt, and self-serving conduct. And a favorite with some, CalPERS General Counsel Matt Jacobs Violated “Zero Tolerance” Policy via Manhandling CEO Marcie Frost; Will CalPERS Sanction Jacobs or Change the Policy?: As much as we enjoy mining the seemingly bottomless vein of misconduct at CalPERS, we feel compelled to commemorate an incident from last week’s offsite because it so deeply offended the people who saw it live — many of them CalPERS beneficiaries who are retired after decades of honorable government service. This incident, of General Counsel Matt Jacobs literally draping himself over CEO Marcie Frost’s shoulders for a long tete-a-tete, was a cut-and-dried violation of CalPERS’ Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation Prevention Policy. It epitomizes CalPERS’ hypocritical and two-faced posture toward board members and senior staff, by which members of the power faction are never held to account or even criticized. By contrast, those who are seeking to clean up CalPERS’ misconduct and incompetence are often severely sanctioned, in ways designed to interfere with the performance of their fiduciary duties.1 …Reports from a half dozen independent sources show that these witnesses were appalled. In fact, the degree of upset was what led one observer to take the pictures above, noting: Matt ❤️ Marcie. CalPERS Santa Rosa off-site. I was a little slow with my camera, so I missed the minutes-long embrace from the other side — because I couldn’t believe that this was actually happening. I was sitting with a woman from XXX and a woman from YYY who both attend SCORE. There was a third woman who I had just met that day who was a [former government job]. They were freaking-out. It started looking like a casual huddle to whisper, but it lingered on-and-on to the point that the women were saying, “Somebody take a picture, this is completely inappropriate!” Jacobs had draped himself over both of Frost’s shoulders with his left arm, his hand casually cupping one of them. I couldn’t tell if it was a “power move” to dominate her or if there was some sort of creepy mutual cuddle-thing going on, because I couldn’t see their faces. He’s huge and she’s tiny; which made the whole incident even creepier from the peanut gallery. Just a horrible “look” smack in front of a group of retired female shop-stewards. There’s also still a soupçon of salaciousness. Other reactions, each from additional sources: Audience Member 1: Attorney Mr Jacobs went to CEO Ms. Marcie Frost and proceeded to put his arm around her shoulders to have a private conversation, he then went to board President Mr. Jones and CEO Ms. Frost and repeated this act from the other side. During this interaction the previously mentioned board member [Theresa Taylor] glanced at this interaction and said nothing. I found the interaction as unacceptable staff interaction and the non action of the board member as conflicting…Persons seated near me commented that the interaction appeared to be inappropriate contact between supervisor and subordinate. Audience Member 2: His behavior was unsettling. I don’t know if he was being controlling or sexual towards little Marcie but it was unprofessional at best and sexual at worst. Audience Member 3: It wasn’t appropriate For a staff member and his boss. It was sexual harassment. Audience Member 4: It was gross. It looked like it could have been sexual but I doubt that. It reminded me more of a big dog we had. He’d put his paw on other dogs to show he was the boss. It is noteworthy that most of the individuals above were older women. Generally speaking, older women grew up in an era where sexual banter and flirting in the workplace were seen as acceptable within bounds. The fact that women of this age group were deeply disturbed suggests that young women would have been even more upset. But as the last comment made explicit, they were disturbed by the power dynamic. By putting his hands on Frost and keeping them there, Jacobs was making a big and very public display of his dominance. The State of California and many government bodies in the state trust CalPERS to handle their money, when most candy stores are better managed. While we can lay a lot of blame for the terrible controls, disregard for the law, and persistent preference for cover-ups rather than clean-ups, the buck ultimately stops with Governor Gavin Newsom. If he’s serious about a Presidential bid in 2028, it would behove him to shake up CalPERS lest some big creepie crawlies emerge during his campaign. Another shocking exposé on these criminal clowns, but just a heads up Yves that your internal links in this piece are broken (unless a user has WordPress admin access at NC) Oh, hell, it will be a huge process to fix them manually. But I am on to it. Just logging off for the night so just a quick comment. It has not escaped my notice of the colour of those postal notes saying ‘signature only please. no date.’ Just sayin’. But now the real fun and games start. CalPERs choosing somebody to fill Jacob’s shoes. Like with Meng, that have had some spectacular fiascos in choosing new people that would be amenable to the, ahem, mysteries ways of CalPERS. I look forward to the resulting posts on what they do. I would not trust Governor Gavin Newsom to do anything effective in reforming CalPERS. At best he will be theatrical, saying all the right words because he is connected to all the corruption in all levels of California’s government. As a mediocre white-collar criminal defense attorney tasked with advising the largest public pension trust fund in the country, Jacobs brought a mix of willful ignorance of the law and a stubborn obsession to run roughshod over it in order to push money out the door to the “right people,” no matter the terms. He is emblematic of an over-subscribed legal profession in which lawyers simply bloviate their “opinions” to clients without reference to fact, statutory, or decisional law. Newsom would be wise to pressure his factotums on the CalPERS Board of Administration to appoint a new General Counsel who understands the fiduciary obligations of a pension trust. The mis-doings at CalPERS are about to blow up in his face and it will be a better look for him to fix them (and blame his predecessors) than to persist in trying to cover them up… My understanding is that the CalPers Board are not direct state employees. Their pay is quite variable. Some double-dip. some don’t. Here’s a 2014 article on CalPers by the SacBee newspaper: https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article4071012.html The article is quite long and you’ll discover why the ‘undated’ travel/expense forms are so useful. This has NOTHING to do with what David in Friday Harbor said and comes off as an unwarranted correction/reprimand. And what they get paid or not paid similarly has nada to do with their legal obligation to handle expenses or board matters generally in accordance with the law. Some are automatically on the board as state officers, namely the state Treasurer. and Comptroller. Others are appointed from different candidates for particular seats by the Governor or legislature. Six seats are elected. One seat is for retirees and so is not a current employee and receives only a modest stipend. Ditto the ex-officio members and the gubernatorial and legislative appointees Of the elected seats, the ones that are currently employed do not quit their jobs to serve on the CalPERS board. They instead get “relief time”, as an a reduction of hours while still receiving full pay, to allow for time spent at CalPERS The issue is that they are all state officers in their capacity as CalPERS board members and subject to various state laws related to that status. Oh, but it does. If the CalPERS Board were direct state employees then Newsom would have real pressure to bear. I understand the Board is a mix of appointed and elected ‘officials’. The SacBee article explains that and identifies why Jacobs would seek undated reimbursement forms—to assist some of the Board members to game the reimbursement system and increase payment for their time working on Board matters. As the article explains, a Cal State Univ. professor was claiming reimbursement for $50K per semester (15 weeks) while actually not teaching anything anywhere. The undated travel claims were likely in service to this particular Board members reimbursement charade. Please stop Making Shit Up. You are way way out of your depth here. Newsom has ample power over CalPERS and its board. He could for starters threaten to prosecute them for felonies over the unsigned expense forms. He could force Marcie Frost’s resignation on any one of a number of abuses (see our archives). The expense forms have NOTHING to do with relief time. That is set based on the # of board meetings and assumptions re prep time for them (if you do your job, there is a lot of material to review before a board meeting). Some employers do wind up taking employees who win CalPERS board seats off all their regular day-job work because it is too difficult to manage the relief time demands and the board meeting schedule and still have them be productive. I know of a former board member who was tortured early in his 8 year tenure as a CalPERS board member by effectively being made to do all of his regular duties in his non-CalPERS time, then they threw up their hands and stopped asking him to work at his official job (my dim recollection is that he was expected to turn up now and again for appearances’ sake). It was just too hard for him to be a useful contributor in his role on a part-time basis. That is the employer’s decision, not CalPERS’ decision. And you are further wrong about Newsom’s power over the state employees as state workers. Once they get past the one year probation period, they are very very hard to fire and have strong due process and appeal rights. Great post! But it also re-raises the question I always ask myself. Namely with so much money being so poorly managed by a state organization over so many years why is this still ongoing and has not been cleaned up? I can’t help but think that someone benefits by CalPERS being such a mess, but haven’t a clue who they might be or why (besides greed). Any ideas? The main beneficiaries are the Congressional Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and now Adam Schiff — who live off the largesse of high-fee Private Equity and Real Estate managers (even though the GOP probably gets more money from them) — the California Democrats and public employee unions — who are relieved of fundraising obligations to the DCCC and the DNC as a “behestment” for CalPERS high-fee largesse — and the unions who see high PE and RE fees as a “Stockholm Syndrome” buy-off that prevents Stanford’s Joe Nation from running a ballot initiative to switch CalPERS to a Pinochet/Thatcher style defined-contribution system. Jacobs was a protegé of Barbara Boxer, the former U.S. Senator from Brooklyn via Marin County, who made it her mission to recognize Tribes so that they could open flashy casino gambling dens up and down the Golden State — with clumsy kick-backs to her ne’er-do-well son Doug. Apparently Jacobs’ one job was to keep the money flowing out the door of CalPERS to the “right” people. If you the compare PE and RE management fees that CalPERS pays with the same fees paid by the teachers pension across the river at CalSTRS, you will find that CalPERS pays nearly TRIPLE in fees as a percentage of AUM while generating slightly lower returns. This amounts to over a BILLION dollars every year in excess fees over the decade of Jacobs’ tenure that aren’t being invested to grow the trust fund. Maybe I have a soft spot for Barbara Boxer as she voted against the AUMF in Iraq while the other CA senator at the time, Feinstein voted for it. But I want to post in Boxer’s defense. As I recall, as I live in the Sonoma County area, Boxer pushed to recognize the defunct tribe that eventually built the Graton Casino (about 8 miles away from where I’m writing this) but Boxer had that the tribe would NOT be allowed to do gambling. Her son did lobby for the tribe after the bill passed. From https://indianz.com/IndianGaming/2010/022426.asp “Update III: The Hill has determined that their portion of the story has serious factual problems, and was not properly researched. For instance, Boxer did not change the bill to allow gaming; her version of the bill continued the House prohibition on it.” Here’s an update about Doug Boxer and his attempted shake-down of the Graton Band: https://consortiumnews.com/2018/11/16/national-exclusive-former-sen-barbara-boxers-son-and-california-powerbroker-found-bilking-indian-tribe/ Crass money-grubbers, if you ask me — even if Boxer did come up through the anti-war movement. CalPERS’s troubles are all about the skim by the politicals. The Repubs were even worse… Well, thanks for reminding us of all the illegal advice that crook Jacobs brought to CalPERS over a decade ago. Jacobs never gave the Board legal advice, it was legal cover. Matt Jacobs is an expert at justifying the unjustifiable. I remember when Bill Slaton at a public meeting accused me of “clear violations of fiduciary duty” and “disregard for confidentiality of materials or decisions reviewed or made by the Board.” He could not come up with any examples. However, a month latter Matt Jacobs came up with charges for him. Matt Jacobs labeled his report “Attorney Client Privileged” so I could not even disclose them nor get my requested public hearing. I still say they are without merit. It’s worth noting, at my Kangaroo court, Mr. Slaton couldn’t defend “his” charges because he said he only knew what Jacobs had written. It’s also noteworthy that Marcie Frost was given a copy but no Board members were given copies even when they asked. Mr. Jacobs advised the Board that the statutory requirement that security transactions by the staff on behalf of the system be made public was satisfied by reporting the dollar value of transactions by asset class. California law requires that before a state body discusses litigation in closed session “the state body shall state the title of, or otherwise specifically identify, the litigation to be discussed …” Mr. Jacobs says “General Counsel’s Update on Pending Litigation” satisfies that requirement. Mr. Jacobs seems to forget that as a government attorney he has an obligation to the public. I am not sorry to see him go and hope he enjoys his retirement. Meanwhile, over at UC: University of California fund ditches hedge funds with scathing rebuke “Hedge funds are a fantastic business if you’re on Wall Street, and you can charge a great fee and then you can afford to buy all the art and the private jets and the amazing houses in the world,” he said. He added: “My only regret is not the fact that we haven’t invested in hedge funds, it’s that I’m not a hedge fund manager.” https://archive.li/MK7fV CalPERS got out of hedge funds in 2014. We deemed that to be 8 years late: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2006/12/fools-and-their-money-hedge-fund.html Note that University of California system != Cal State System, with only the latter being part of CalPERS. UC = prestige operation/where the nobel prizes happen No, UC has its own pension system. Similarly, California school teachers have their own system, CalSTRS. But non-teacher school employees like administrators and bus drivers are in CalPERS. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * Subscriptions

Geopolitical uncertainties are forcing family offices out of U.S. equities, diversifying into cash and liquid alternatives, according to BlackRock’s annual Global Family Office Survey. Global family offices find themselves in “risk-management mode,” as 68% reported scrambling to diversify their assets. Some 84% of respondents said geopolitical uncertainty is the most important issue for them and is a critical factor in their capital allocation decisions. Alternatives are benefiting from increased allocations and now make up 42% of single-family office portfolios, up from 39% in 2022, according to the data. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Private credit and infrastructure are the most-favored alternatives. In addition, 32% of family offices reported plans to increase their allocations to private credit, and 30% said they intend to raise their infrastructure allocation in2025-26. Infrastructure is also gaining strong momentum, with 75% of respondents reporting they feel positive about the prospects for the asset class. Armando Senra, BlackRock’s head of institutional business in the Americas, said with 60% of family offices pessimistic about the global outlook, confidence has been further shaken by new U.S. tariffs. “Family offices are now prioritizing diversification, liquidity, and structural reassessment of risk as they build resilience in their investment portfolios,” he said in a statement. Many of the 175 single-family offices surveyed, which collectively have $320 billion in assets, want to collaborate with external partners, especially when it comes to private markets. Many cited gaps in their internal expertise on reporting (57%), deal-sourcing (63%) and private-market analytics (75%). Almost one-quarter (22%) reported using an outsourced chief investment officer or would consider doing so. The majority of respondents said they would also consider using artificial intelligence for a variety of tasks from risk management to cash-flow modelling. Finally, 45% reported being more likely to invest in technology firms building AI solutions, while 51% said they were interested in investment opportunities they believe will benefit from the growth in AI, and 33% reported planning to deploy AI tech internally to improve their investing process.

Title: Ethereum ETF Evolution: BlackRock Aims To Boost ETHA Returns With Proposed ETH Staking
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-evolution/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T13:00:42Z
Full Content:
Spot Ethereum ETFs could be gearing up for a notable shift as crucial efforts are being made constantly to include ETH staking into the exchange products. At the forefront of this key advancement in the ETH spot ETFs is BlackRock, which has recently taken steps to bring this idea into reality. As the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) gain momentum in the crypto sector, BlackRock has taken a bold step to enhance its exchange fund. The largest asset management company has recently filed for an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This move was highlighted in the amended 19b-4 filing submitted by Nasdaq to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Such a move would allow BlackRock’s fund to use Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism to increase returns for investors. Thus, the exchange fund could earn rewards by confirming transactions on the ETH network. BlackRock’s action toward integrating staking in its ETHA marks a pivotal moment for the asset manager and its fund, redefining crypto investment. Should this application get a green light from the US SEC, it is likely to pave the way for a new era of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that combine decentralized financial mechanisms with conventional accessibility. According to TerraNewsEN on the social media platform X, “staking in Ethereum ETFs is not new.” In the X post, the informative platform noted that BlackRock and the US SEC have already discussed this move before the asset manager took a decisive step to submit an application. With positive news swelling around Ethereum, the platform is confident that BlackRock‘s demand for staking will yield promising results, particularly in terms of price. “BlackRock did not acquire ETH for nothing,” the platform added. While ETH rose to $3,600 mark following the news, TerraNewsEN has highlighted $4,200 as the next critical level for the altcoin to reclaim. If the asset surpasses the $4,200 level, the platform anticipates a massive rally to a new all-time high of $5,000 and beyond. Another exciting news concerning Ethereum that is making headlines in the crypto landscape is GameStop’s latest attempt to acquire more ETH into its treasury. Filing Tracker reported that the leading retail gaming company could be on the verge of purchasing ETH worth over $70 million. It is worth noting that the $70 million was generated from a public offering where the firm sold about 46,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 each. The report shows that this move is supported by GameStop’s strategic partnership with Dialectic, a leading crypto native capital management and yield generation.

Title: Important Notice to Long-Term Shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC); DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV); Napco Security Technologies, Inc, (NASDAQ: NSSC); and Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI); Grabar Law Office is Investigating Claims on Your Behalf

July 18, 2025 08:49 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, July 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024 and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #NAPCO Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

XRP price today soared to $3.48, rising nearly 7%, after the U.S. House passed major crypto bills and corporations like VivoPower and Webus announced $421 million in XRP holdings. Whale wallets added a massive $7.1 billion, boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. With support from Trump-era crypto momentum and bullish technicals, analysts now predict XRP could hit $5 soon—and possibly reach $10 if this trend continues. The rally follows XRP breaking its 2018 all-time high, signaling strong demand and growing use cases. Investors are watching closely as XRP enters a new phase of explosive price discovery in 2025.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/18/netflix-stock-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T12:08:15Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a stellar performer, nearly doubling over the last 12 months to levels of about $1,270 currently. The rally has been driven by the company’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming tier. Momentum has clearly been on Netflix’s side, and Q2 results published yesterday exceeded expectations, with the top line growing 16%. However, we believe the stock faces considerable downside risk at these elevated levels. With mounting macroeconomic uncertainty and signs that subscriber growth could slow, investors may be underestimating potential risks. In our view, the stock could fall significantly - possibly dropping below $500 per share. A 50% to 60% correction may sound extreme, but it wouldn’t be unprecedented. It has happened before, and could very well happen again. In a downturn, NFLX stock could lose considerably. There is evidence from as recently as 2022 that NFLX stock lost over 70% of its value in the matter of just a couple of quarters. So, could NFLX’s roughly $1,270 stock slide to under $500 levels if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio - and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JULY 19: The Netflix logo is displayed at Netflix offices on July 19, ... More 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Members of SAG-AFTRA, Hollywood's largest union which represents actors and other media professionals, have joined striking WGA (Writers Guild of America) workers in the first joint walkout against the studios since 1960. The strike could shut down Hollywood productions completely with writers in the third month of their strike against the Hollywood studios. Netflix reported second quarter earnings after the closing bell today. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Why Is It Relevant Now? Netflix’s subscriber growth could eventually slow, as key initiatives like the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported plans have already been rolled out across major markets. These were major strategic shifts aimed at unlocking new revenue streams and expanding the user base after growth plateaued post-pandemic. However, they likely pulled forward demand that might have otherwise materialized over the next few years. This might result in softer subscriber additions going forward. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 could also signal internal expectations of slower growth. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, pushing its paid user base to nearly 302 million as of the end of 2024, a record annual increase that significantly contributed to the stock’s rally. Growth was largely driven by its measures to curb password sharing, which encouraged users to either pay for extra member access or sign up for new accounts. This initiative, now active in more than 100 countries, helped Netflix improve monetization while boosting sign-ups. Meanwhile, the ad-supported tier has gained strong traction, with Netflix indicating last quarter that it had over 94 million ad supported users. However, with these growth levers now largely used up, Netflix may face headwinds in sustaining its momentum, which could impact the performance of the stock. Economic uncertainty, higher costs, could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. The imposition of tariffs on key trading partners is already causing U.S. inflation to pick up. This could lower disposable income, and potentially weaken consumer spending. This could be a negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also doesn't help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could lead to slower new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content costs are set to rise as it ventures deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, that may involve higher production costs and licensing expenses. While Netflix saw margins rise in Q2, it warned that operating margins over the second half of 2025 could trend lower due to higher content amortization and rising marketing costs associated with its content slate. How Resilient Is NFLX Stock During A Downturn? NFLX stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • NFLX stock fell 75.9% from a high of $691.69 on 17 November 2021 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 August 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $1339.13 on 30 June 2025 and currently trades at around $1,270 • NFLX stock fell 22.9% from a high of $387.78 on 18 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock fell 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 Premium Valuation At the current stock price of $1,270 per share, Netflix trades at around 50x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears expensive in our view. In comparison, the stock was trading at levels of around 20x earnings back in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial performance has been strong, markets tend to be short-sighted, extrapolating short-term successes for the long run. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong streak of subscriber additions and likely grow revenues comfortably at double digits. However, there’s a real possibility that Netflix will soon see subscriber growth cool, as the twin benefit of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, with economic uncertainty also growing in the U.S. Consensus estimates also point to just about 12%-13% growth over 2025 and 2026. Concerned about Netflix stock's elevated valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Posted on July 18, 2025 by Nick Roach 2 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 19. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 17 and 18, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 121 bug fixes and improvements, five new features, including Flexbox Layouts, Interactions, Improved Backward Compatibility, Relative Colors, and Find and Replace, and made significant progress on two upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, almost every team has finished their features and is now focused on fixing bugs in preparation for the upcoming public beta. You can expect bug fixes to ramp up over the next month, with a new focus on testing and fixing migration-related issues. In addition to all the little bug fixes, Public Alpha 19 also comes with a few minor improvements: Of course, these minor improvements don’t include all the big features we introduced, so keep reading to learn about those! We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.2. 🎉 Divi 5’s new Flexbox layout system has arrived. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was left unturned, no option was forgotten—we did it all, and it’s best in class. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.1. 🎉 Interactions is a robust system for creating interactive elements such as popups and toggles, and creative scroll-based and mouse-movement-based effects. It’s not a pop-up builder; it’s an anything builder. Create a trigger, assign an effect, choose a target, and bring your custom interactions to life. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18. 🎉 We’ve been testing all the top-selling products in the Divi Marketplace and improving Divi 5’s backward compatibility system so that, when the time comes, everyone will be able to upgrade. With the improved backward compatibility update, legacy modules are now available in the Add Module panel and will function much better than before. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17.1. 🎉 Divi’s color revolution has arrived, positioning Divi as the clear leader in color management and advanced color systems. 🎉 Divi’s color picker has been completely redesigned, and it doesn’t get any better. Using HSL, you can create mathematically beautiful, variable-based color systems that are easy to manage, revolutionizing how you manage colors on your websites. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17. 🎉 Find and Replace is an impressive efficiency tool for Divi power users that will speed up your workflow and play an essential role in helping old websites adopt Divi 5’s new design systems, such as variables. Right-click on any field to find and replace its value within a given scope. It’s a simple concept, but boy, is it useful, and it’s not something you’ll find in most page builders. 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder last month, and it’s almost finished. Our goal is to release it next week! The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. Our first batch of WooCommerce product modules is almost finished and will be the next feature we release after Loop Builder. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 17 through Public Alpha 19. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~1.5 months based on our progress; 2-3 weeks to wrap up Loop Builder and Woo Modules, followed by a few weeks of focused bug fixing. There are two things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and the majority of our team is now focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

Title: How the Right Is Waging War on Climate-Conscious Investing
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/leonard-leo-consumers-research-esg-climate/683581/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
A Leonard Leo–funded effort to destroy ESG has scared off much of corporate America. In January 2020, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock—the world’s largest asset-management firm—released his annual letter to corporate executives. The letters had become something of a tradition: part investor missive, part State of the Union, dispatched each year from the top of the financial world. This one struck a tone of alarm that would reverberate far beyond Wall Street. “Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects,” Fink warned. “We are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.” He said that BlackRock would be “increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress” on sustainability. The message signaled the degree to which a once-obscure investing philosophy known as ESG—short for “environmental, social, and governance”—had become a boardroom priority. For a moment, it looked like corporate America would weigh carbon emissions alongside profits. More major companies soon announced climate goals and promised new standards of accountability. BlackRock helped lead an effort to elect sustainability advocates to the board of ExxonMobil. A consensus seemed to be forming: Business could be a force for good, and markets might even help save the planet. Now, just five years later, that consensus is crumbling. BP is pulling back on a commitment to invest in renewables—and is reportedly expanding plans for drilling. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have scaled back their plastic-reduction pledges. Major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, are hedging their climate bets and investing heavily in fossil-fuel companies. Asset-management firms that joined BlackRock in embracing ESG—including Vanguard and State Street—have also backed off. And Fink’s 2025 letter to investors does not even mention the word climate. James Surowiecki: The hottest trend in investing is mostly a sham “This further exacerbates the problem of slow-walking climate action at a time when the temperature records are being broken and devastating weather events are accelerating,” Richard Brooks, the climate finance director for Stand.earth, an international environmental-advocacy organization that focuses in part on corporate contributions to climate change, told us. This global retreat has been particularly acute in the United States, where political resistance to ESG has grown into an organized countermovement. The issue is now a fixture in partisan attack ads, Republican statehouse legislation, and right-wing media. The forces arrayed against ESG say they are just getting started. In January, a group of present and former Republican state officials gathered at a posh resort in Sea Island, Georgia, together with conservative leaders, for a two-day lesson in how to dismantle corporate America’s most ambitious response to climate change. At the Cloister, with its golf courses, tennis courts, and beaches, ESG was denounced as a sinister force undermining free markets and democracy. “I would hope everyone here is pretty much committed to destroying ESG,” said Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, the organization that has led the fight. His group, he said, had spent $5 million running ads “educating consumers” about the dangers of ESG. Hild spread a similar message at other events this spring, according to transcripts of his remarks that we obtained. “ESG is when they use their market share to push a far-left agenda, without ever having to go to voters, without any electoral accountability,” said Hild at a March meeting of state activists. “This is not the free market operating. This is a cartel. This is a mafia.” At its core, ESG investing means integrating nonfinancial factors—such as climate risk, carbon emissions, pollution, and corporate governance—into investment decisions, with the idea that these issues could materially affect long-term performance. Firms that offer ESG funds screen out companies that don’t meet a set of criteria for climate protection, and pitch their products to investors as climate-friendly alternatives to conventional funds. But in the eyes of its critics, ESG investing undermines democratic governance, imposes political priorities through the financial system, and breaches the independence of state financial officers to seek maximum return on investments. “By applying arbitrary ESG financial metrics that serve no one except the companies that created them, elites are circumventing the ballot box to implement a radical ideological agenda,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in 2023 when he introduced legislation prohibiting the use of ESG investment by Florida pension and other state funds. That narrative has taken hold with a wide swath of Republican leaders. Donald Trump attacked ESG on the campaign trail last year, and in an April 8 executive order, the president said that state-level climate-emissions and ESG laws “are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy. They should not stand.” The roots of ESG can be traced to faith-based investing of the 18th century, when some religious denominations sought to avoid investment in corporations that promoted trading enslaved people. In the 20th century, the movement called “socially responsible investing” gained momentum during the civil-rights era and, later, in connection with opposition to apartheid in South Africa. The term ESG was formally coined in a 2004 report by the United Nations Global Compact titled “Who Cares Wins,” which argued that better corporate integration of environmental, social, and governance factors could lead to more-sustainable markets and better outcomes around the globe. ESG investing grew in the 2010s as the public grew more concerned about diversity, the environment, and executive pay. Major asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street began offering ESG products, and companies competed to establish metrics to track compliance. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock played an especially influential role. Because there was no single established metric for meeting climate goals, critics on the left complained that ESG encouraged greenwashing, in which companies claim to be making environmental progress without making an actual commitment. But even critics were forced to concede that ESG brought about increased transparency. In 2018, 34 percent of publicly traded global companies disclosed greenhouse-gas-emission details. By 2023, that share had risen to 63 percent, an increase generally attributable to ESG efforts, according to R. Paul Herman, the founder and CEO of HIP Investor Inc. Although many asset managers noted the difficulties of measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, they embraced ESG as part of their long-term management strategy—and trillions of dollars flowed to them. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG-fund assets reached around $30 trillion in 2022. The analytics firm forecast in February 2024 that global ESG assets would surpass $40 trillion by 2030. Expectations for ESG have now fallen off dramatically—and Hild and his three colleagues at Consumers’ Research can claim much of the credit. At seminars such as the one at Sea Island, Hild and his allies armed a network of Republican state attorneys general, state treasurers, and comptrollers with legal and political ammunition. The key funders of such efforts include fossil-fuel-industry executives and Leonard Leo, who is best known for his leadership of the Federalist Society. In recent years, Leo has moved beyond his focus on transforming America’s courts, vowing in videotaped remarks in 2023 to take on “wokeism in the corporate environment, in the educational environment,” biased media, and “entertainment that is really corrupting our youth.” Beginning in 2021, Leo and his team injected cash into a long-dormant organization that they would use to fight ESG: Consumers’ Research. A spokesperson for Leo told us that “woke companies are defrauding their consumers and poisoning our culture, and Leonard Leo is proud to support Will Hild and Consumers’ Research as they crush liberal dominance in those woke companies and hold them accountable.” The organization found a receptive audience among Republican state officials eager for a road map to combatting ESG. The group emphasized using leverage that states possess through their management of pension funds to punish investment firms that had signed on to boycott oil and gas companies. Zoë Schlanger: The climate can’t afford another Trump presidency Republican attorneys general from a few fossil-fuel-dependent states, such as Texas and West Virginia, began in 2021 to investigate whether investments tied to ESG guidelines violated state laws. They sent letters of inquiry to major firms such as BlackRock and Vanguard, questioning whether their ESG practices were legally compatible with states’ fiduciary obligations, especially concerning pension funds. That same year, Texas enacted Senate Bill 13, which requires state pension systems and other state endowments to divest from financial institutions seen as hostile to the oil and gas industry. Under that law, the state attorney general’s office placed more than 370 investment firms on a blacklist—including BlackRock and several divisions of major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The following year, the offensive intensified. A coalition of 19 Republican attorneys general sent a joint letter to Fink, the BlackRock CEO, accusing the company of putting climate goals ahead of financial returns and pressuring corporations to align with international climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement. “BlackRock appears to use the hard-earned money of our states’ citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment,” the letter warned. It cited proxy-voting strategies and coordination with groups such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative as potential legal overreach. Since 2022, 23 Republican state attorneys general have opened investigations into ESG-focused investment firms. Several of those officials had help from an Arizona-based private firm, Fusion Law, which received $4.5 million from Consumers’ Research in its first two years of existence. One of the firm’s founders, Paul Watkins, is a former Arizona civil-litigation chief in the state’s attorney general’s office—and was also a legal fellow at Consumers’ Research. “Paul Watkins and Fusion Law have been essential in helping to unravel and document the inner workings of ESG,” Hild told us. The firm has had contracts to work on ESG-related issues with attorneys general in Tennessee and Utah. Watkins has been a featured speaker at Consumers’ Research events, including the gathering in January. Recently, state-level investigators began probing the question of whether environmental groups, asset managers, and shareholder-advocacy organizations were engaged in collusion, using ESG to restrain trade in fossil-fuel companies, in violation of antitrust laws. The opposition of red-state officials has chilled discussion of sustainable investments at institutional-investor meetings, according to participants, despite accusations of hypocrisy from Democratic officials in blue states. Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, told us that Republicans are distorting investment decisions by putting their thumb on the scale against ESG. “These are people who once upon a time believed in free markets,” Lander, a Democrat, told us. “I’m not telling anyone how to invest. I just don’t want them to tell me.” Evidence suggests that the Republican push has been costly to taxpayers. A study by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business found that the Texas law banning municipalities from doing business with banks that have ESG policies reduced the competition for borrowing—and generated a potential cost of up to $532 million in extra interest per year. Nonetheless, the anti-ESG movement is spreading: What began largely as a state-level attack has now blossomed on Capitol Hill. In mid-2023, House Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, launched a wide-ranging probe into ESG practices. More than 60 entities, including environmental groups, corporations, and financial institutions, were asked to provide information on alleged coordination aimed at limiting fossil-fuel investment. The committee’s interim staff report, released last year, accused ESG advocates of forming a “climate cartel” that sought to “impose left-wing environmental, social, and governance goals” through coordinated pressure campaigns. The report alleged that such efforts amounted to collusion in restraint of trade. During his inquiry, Jordan issued waves of subpoenas targeting organizations such as Ceres, BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and the shareholder-advocacy nonprofit As You Sow. Targets of the inquiry were required to turn over more than 100,000 pages of email and other communications as the committee investigated allegations of antitrust violations and collusion in recommending sustainable-investment options. “The investigation was abusive, and it was chilling,” said Danielle Fugere, the president and chief counsel of As You Sow, who testified for more than eight hours before Jordan’s panel last year. “You cannot defy the reality of climate change and the scientific imperative of acting,” said Mindy Lubber, the president and CEO of the pro-sustainability nonprofit group Ceres, which has been active in prodding companies into taking part in ESG measures. But, she said, “everybody is afraid of the bull’s-eyes on their backs.” Annie Lowrey: If you’re worried about the climate, move your money Jordan’s inquiry is continuing this year, with a focus on possible antitrust violations by environmental organizations and asset managers and advisors. The pressure is working as intended. After Jordan launched his inquiry, many high-profile firms exited the Climate Action 100+ initiative. Coalitions of financial institutions that once committed to sustainable investing have collapsed. Several U.S. banks—including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—withdrew from an influential bankers’ climate coalition, citing legal risk and political pressure. BlackRock and Vanguard pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, leading that group to halt operations. “Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the company said in a letter to clients. “BlackRock’s active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” The company, which declined our request to interview Fink, referred us to other official statements including one noting that “BlackRock’s sustainable and transition investing platform is driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets.” Other asset managers issued similar statements, noting that they would still offer green-investment options. But interest in ESG funds has declined substantially. U.S. investment funds specializing in climate experienced net inflows of $70 billion in 2021—but by 2023, the tide had reversed, with money flowing out of the funds faster than it was coming in. Last year, net outflows amounted to $19.6 billion, with the trend continuing into the first quarter of 2025, according to Morningstar Analytics. Proxy initiatives from shareholders interested in sustainable investing have also declined, another casualty of the war against ESG. “This has been a silent spring,” William Patterson, a former director for investment for the AFL-CIO who tracks climate-related shareholder action, told us. “Investor initiatives on climate, which attained broad shareholder support in the past, are barely present” at investor meetings this year. Meanwhile, the number of anti-ESG proxy proposals more than quadrupled from 2021 to 2024. As of February, a fifth of all shareholder proposals submitted were filed by anti-ESG groups. Despite the precipitous decline of ESG investing, its detractors are not ready to declare victory. Consumers’ Research, for one, is committed to pressing on. “ESG is in retreat, but it is not defeated yet,” Hild told us. “We have a long way to go before people get rid of it.” Proponents are not relenting either, and are looking forward to a moment when the political winds shift once more. “What I hear, especially in the U.S., is twofold,” said Daniel Klier, the chief executive of the advisory firm South Pole. “One message is ‘Keep your head down,’ but also that climate change will not go away—and we need to prepare for the decades to come and not just in the next four years.”

Title: America’s Worst Polluters See a Lifeline in Power-Gobbling AI—and Donald Trump

President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House on July 15, 2025, in Washington, as Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt watches in reverence.. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP This story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants, and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. economy has been surprisingly resilient while the tariff wars rage even though prices may go up as inventories dwindle, consumers are becoming more value conscious, and investors are by turns sanguine and skittish. (Witness their reaction to the specter of President Trump potentially firing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as my colleague Jim Edwards noted in this piece.) I had a chance to speak with several business leaders at a roundtable convened by Edward Jones Managing Partner Penny Pennington recently at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Her concern was, “how do we help future generations build wealth in this uncertain economy?” With challenges like high home prices and an uncertain job market, she takes a holistic view of the customer. “We’re a wealth and wellbeing company.” The theme of investing took many forms. Bev Anderson, CEO of BECU credit union, focused on creating financial opportunities, while Gallup CEO Jon Clifton talked about the need for better global indicators of how we feel amid a rise in negative emotions. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack is expanding his energy infrastructure amid surging demand at the country’s second-largest utility. Optimism about the power of technology and innovation was mixed with worries about geopolitics and the state of civil society. In an era of growing complexity and rapid change, face-to-face conversations have become even more important for sharing ideas and building trusted relationships. That’s why the dinners hosted by CEO Initiative members around the country have been so valuable. It’s why I’m excited by our upcoming Fortune Global Forum on October 26 and 27 in Riyadh. Among the CEOs who have confirmed their attendance, so far, are Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Ed Bastian of Delta Air Lines, Tony Elumelu of United Bank for Africa, Jane Fraser of Citigroup, Mahindra & Mahindra Anish Shah, Catherine MacGregor of ENGIE, Honeywell’s Vimal Kapur, Gilberto Tomazoni of JBS, and Jenny Johnson of Franklin Templeton.

This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. On social media, he added, “I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.” He also asked the attorney general to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” on Epstein. Here is a timeline of the relationship between Trump and Epstein. How Sam Altman became Trump’s best AI buddy Initially cut out of the president’s circle by Elon Musk, Altman has been quietly cultivating his relationship with the president, the WSJ reports. With Musk out of the way, Altman is now more influential in the White House. The maneuvering required Altman to renounce his former public dislike of Trump. Trump vs. corn syrup President Trump’s announcement Wednesday claiming that Coca-Cola would substitute corn syrup for raw sugar in their products “cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs … all with no nutritional benefit,” the CEO of the Corn Refiners Association said on Wednesday. The announcement also caused significant dips in the stock prices of some corn syrup manufacturers between Wednesday and Thursday. Morgan Stanley on tariffs Morgan Stanley’s head of US policy, Monica Guerra, describes President Trump’s tariffs as a “mosaic” and “idiosyncratic.” Here’s how much she thinks they’ll bring to the U.S. Treasury—and how they could fuel higher inflation. Europe tightens sanctions on Russia The EU will impose a new set of sanctions on Russia targeting its oil, gas and banking sectors. Twenty more banks will be cut from the SWIFT payments system and there will be new restrictions on Russian oil refined outside of Russia. Meta poaches more AI talent from Apple Former Apple employees Mark Lee and Tom Gunter will join Meta’s Superintelligence Labs, according to Bloomberg. They will join Ruoming Pang, the former head of Apple’s large language model unit, who joined Meta a few weeks ago. Pang was reportedly offered $200 million in compensation to make the move. Deep dive on the growth of private credit JPMorgan recently dedicated $50 billion to debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals. Apollo, Ares, and KKR are extending credit that they originate independently to lock in borrowers for years. In exchange for tying up that long-term money, borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates than they would get from banks. Fortune 500 Power Moves S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.14% this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.54% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.4% in early trading. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.32% this morning, placing it above 9,000, which would be an all-time high if it holds. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.6%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.21%. Bitcoin is still above $118K. ING on the Fed: “Firmer retail sales and subdued jobless claims numbers suggest the Fed will keep rates on hold for now as officials assess the impact of tariffs on inflation,” per James Knightley. Oxford Economics on jobless claims: “Continued claims continued their march higher in the week July 5, underscoring how unemployed workers are finding it difficult to find new jobs in a labor market where hiring is slow. Claims for benefits by federal employees posted the largest one-week increase since February. We expect these claims will rise further now that Supreme Court has cleared the way to proceed with layoffs of federal workers while legal challenges continue,” Nancy Vanden Houten. WARC on Reddit’s revenue and user growth: “Reddit has demonstrated remarkable year-on-year growth with global advertising revenue projected to reach $1.8 billion in 2025 (+49.6%) and grow to $2.5 billion by 2026 (+39.0%), positioning itself as a formidable competitor to established Big Tech and digital platforms. … The platform’s advertising reach has grown to 606 million users — representing nearly one in 14 people worldwide, according to Datareportal analysis, surpassing X's reach (586 million) and approaching Snapchat (709 million).” Amazon Ring’s founder is back as CEO with a hard pivot to AI.

Title: BlackRock files with SEC to add staking in Ethereum ETF – Details here!

ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management. Nasdaq submitted an updated filing to the SEC to add staking to the iShares Ethereum Trust issued by BlackRock. This came after ETHA saw $499 million in daily inflows, but the price of ETH has not moved much in recent hours. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the 17th of July, BlackRock is looking to upgrade its iShares Ethereum Trust [ETHA] to include staking. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq “to permit staking of ether held by the Trust”. Nasdaq and BlackRock were not the first ETF issuers to push to update their Ethereum spot ETF to include the option for staking. In March, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) group and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) proposed adding ETH staking to Fidelity, Franklin, and Bitwise ETFs. Rival issuers 21Shares and Grayscale have also previously submitted such proposals. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF by assets under management. As of the 17th of July, it had $7.9 billion in assets under management and saw a $499 million inflow on the 16th of July. Speaking on the topic, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart clarified that staking was “not yet done“. He said, “Staking is not “done”. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October.” Seyffart added, “The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25)”. Vance Spencer, co-founder of crypto-native investment firm Framework Ventures, commented on X: “Maybe you didn’t expect Lubin and Tom Lee to lead the TradFi bandwagon to ETH, and BlackRock to add staking just as the wheels start to turn. But that’s what’s happening. There’s no need to be upset.” Spencer referred to Joe Lubin and Tom Lee in his post. Lubin is the chairman of SharpLink Gaming, and Lee is a top Wall Street strategist and Head of Research at Fundstrat. SharpLink [SBET] has the largest ETH reserves, surpassing even the Ethereum Foundation. It was reported that SharpLink would offer up to $5 billion of common stock to acquire more ETH. Spencer’s post highlights TradFi’s growing interest in Ethereum. He pointed to BlackRock’s move to add staking to its ETH ETF. This signals rising institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. Spencer suggested the shift is already underway, and there’s no reason to be upset. The price of Ethereum [ETH] has not reacted much since the news came out. The past two hours of trading before the time of writing saw ETH fall 0.53% to $3,409. However, the leading altcoin has outperformed the industry giant Bitcoin [BTC] and its competing Layer 1 altcoin Solana [SOL] comfortably over the past week.

Title: Investor Dan Ives Says Microsoft and Nvidia To Hit $5,000,000,000,000 Market Cap in Months, Unveils Four Stocks Primed To Outperform

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, is predicting that two big-named tech stocks will hit astronomical market caps. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share. Meanwhile, Snowflake (SNOW) is trading for $211 per share at time of writing, and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is trading for $282 per share.

Title: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout

After beating the resistance mounted at the $3,000 by bears for months now, the Ethereum price looks primed for a further breakout. Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge. The post highlights the fact that Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways. However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Data from the Farside website shows that Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive net flows for almost two weeks straight now. The likes of BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge with tens of thousands of ETH being bought up daily. Ethereum treasury companies are now the rave of the moment as the likes of SharpLink and BitMine begin accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH. This rise in institutional adoption has become one of the major pushes for Ethereum as investors clamor for new highs.

Title: All-Ireland hurling final: Joe Canning’s Cork player profiles
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2025/07/18/all-ireland-hurling-final-joe-cannings-cork-player-profiles/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Age: 28 Club: Ballinhassig Debut: v Limerick, 2021 His long puckouts to Brian Hayes are a key weapon for Cork, but Collins is good at medium-range deliveries too and his puckouts to Tim O’Mahony were particularly impressive in the semi-final. In some situations, like for Limerick’s goal in the Munster final, he needs to stay on his feet longer. Age: 27 Club: Castlelyons Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 O’Leary is a no-fuss kind of player: tight and tough. I don’t think Cork will worry about match-ups in their full-back line. O’Leary loves a one-on-one battle and he’ll be trusted to pick up whoever comes into his corner. One of Cork’s best players in the league, he has carried that form into the championship. Age: 22 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 For many years after Diarmuid O’Sullivan retired, number three has been a problem for Cork. Downey has nailed down the position now. Occasionally he looks vulnerable in the air, but I don’t think it’s a weakness. He had a brilliant final last year, but John McGrath’s movement and intelligence will ask some questions. Age: 29 Club: Inniscarra Debut: v Clare, 2018 Lost the captaincy at the beginning of the year and it looked like he might be under pressure to hold his place. However, O’Donoghue has been brilliant this season. Marked Darragh McCarthy in the league final and was lined up to mark him again in the championship until McCarthy was sent off in the first minute. Age: 23 Club: Castlemartyr Debut: v Limerick, 2022 Even though he likes to do a bit of hurling, Joyce is Cork’s go-to man marker in the half-back line. I expect him to tag Jake Morris and the outcome of that duel will have an impact on the result. Has also done well at centre back during the championship when Robert Downey was injured. Age: 25 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Limerick, 2019 Has had an injury-interrupted season but made an impact off the bench in the Munster final and was commanding against Dublin, especially under the high ball. Andrew Ormond will pose a different test this weekend and I think Tipp will target Downey’s channel with pace. Age: 27 Club: Blarney Debut: v Wexford, 2016 Had a good final last year and his overall form this season is much better than last year. Very good going forward and delivers quick ball into his forwards, but not as effective going towards his own goal. Sam O’Farrell will have defensive duties in his own half, though, and that will suit Coleman. Age: 28 Club: Newtownshandrum Debut: v Clare, 2018 O’Mahony is the engine of the team and when he’s going well Cork seem to go well. When he didn’t have an influence against Limerick in the round-robin game, Cork had no foothold in the middle third. He’s been outstanding in the last two games, returning to the form he showed in the league. Age: 28 Club: Charleville Debut: v Tipperary, 2017 Cork played him at centre forward for a lot of the year, but I think centre field is his best position. O’Mahony’s capacity to break up the play makes him a perfect foil and gives Fitzgibbon the freedom to attack. Had a huge game in the Munster final when Cork really needed their leaders to stand up. Age: 21 Club: Lisgoold Debut: v Clare, 2025 Did exceptionally well in the Munster final and though he’s a young player in his rookie season, there seems to be no question about his temperament. Had a quieter game against Dublin in the semi-final, but he has a very bright future. Tall, athletic, rangy with a good eye for a score. Age: 24 Club: Blarney Debut: v Dublin, 2020 Was one of the favourites for Hurler of the Year going into last year’s All-Ireland and came back to that kind of form against Limerick in the Munster final. His shooting was off against Dublin, but even on a day like that he’s always busy and asking questions. Will force Tipp to think about their options at number six. Age: 27 Club: Fr O’Neill’s Debut: v Tipperary, 2019 After a frustrating year with injuries, he came storming back to form in the semi-final against Dublin. He also had a hugely effective semi-final last year but failed to back it up against Clare. That experience will stand to him. Takes the pressure off Patrick Horgan with long-range frees. Age: 37 Club: Glen Rovers Debut: v Tipperary 2008 Deserves to win an All-Ireland and maybe it will finally come on Sunday. Cork don’t depend on him nearly as much as they have over the years, which is better for everyone. Has not hit his usual percentages with dead balls but still good for a couple of scores from play. Age: 24 Club: Blackrock Debut: v Limerick, 2021 Had a spectacular match against Dublin but he doesn’t always deliver. He strikes me as a confidence player who needs the first couple of possessions to go well. If that happens, he could be electric. Always thinking about a goal and has scored five against Tipp in his last three games against them. Age: 24 Club: St Finbarr’s Debut: v Tipperary, 2023 With the biggest game of the year left, he’s my Hurler of the Year. Everything goes through him in the Cork attack, whether it’s a long puckout or a ball sent in from the middle third. His improvement over the last 14 months has been phenomenal and nothing seems to phase him. With Séamus Harnedy not fit to start, he’s a huge option to come on. As well as him, they have plenty of experience on the bench: Shane Kingston, Conor Lehane and Damien Cahalane have all been around a long time. Pat Ryan (Manager) Donal O’Rourke, Brendan Coleman, Fergal Condon, Donal O’Mahony Pat Ryan has never looked for excuses on Cork’s bad days and he’s never blamed the players. That’s a great trait in a manager and the players will appreciate that. The way he has handled himself and the team has been hugely impressive.

Title: Remove statute of limitations to encourage churches and orders to pay sex-abuse redress - expert

In November 2022, when a tsunami of sexual abuse allegations swept into the public domain following the broadcast of the RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys, much of the focus was on abuse in Irish schools run by some of the religious orders. However, allegations soon emerged about similar abuse in primary and secondary schools run by the Catholic and Protestant Churches. On many grounds, not least moral, they would appear to be as obliged as the State and religious orders when it comes to contributing to compensation for people abused in their schools. Traditionally, the Irish education system has been run by the churches. Currently, 88 per cent of primary schools in Ireland are Catholic, with 5.7 per cent linked to the Church of Ireland. At second level, of 717 of 722 post-primary schools are run in association with the main churches – 338 have a Catholic ethos, 21 are Church of Ireland, 211 are multi-denominational and 147 are inter-denominational. Of the remaining five, two are Quaker-run, while Presbyterians, Methodists and Jews run one each. All schools come within the remit of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee earlier this month. Based on previous inquiries and convictions in the courts, it is known there was sexual abuse in schools other than those run by religious congregations. Yet, recent discussion around redress seems focused entirely on contributions made, or not, by religious orders, which have been found wanting. For instance, all four religious orders involved in running Magdalene laundries refused to contribute to a redress scheme for women who spent time in those institutions. Of the eight religious congregations involved in running the Mother and Baby Homes, just two have agreed to contribute to redress for survivors. Of the approximate €1.5 billion paid to survivors of residential institutions for children, about 16 per cent has come from the 18 religious congregations that ran them. According to Department of Education figures, the total adjusted offers towards redress from those orders amounted to €435.53 million, with €245.24 million realised. Even the controversial 2002 “indemnity deal" entered into by the 18 religious congregation has not been fulfilled. Two properties have yet to be transferred, with €124.94 million of the €128 million pledged under the deal realised so far. Prof Conor O’Mahony, director of the Child Law Clinic at UCC, said one possible way of encouraging the orders and the churches to contribute to a redress scheme would be to remove a statute of limitations on survivors taking legal actions against them. “Then it would be in their interest to contribute to a redress scheme, as a way of reducing overall costs.” O’Mahony noted, however, that under Article 44 of the Constitution, the orders are entitled to hold on to their property. Where the State is concerned, and repeating what he wrote in this newspaper following publication of the scoping inquiry report last September, he said “survivors, solicitors, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Child Law Clinic in UCC have spent a decade battling the Department of Education, seeking the full implementation of the O’Keeffe judgment, but this has yet to happen". Louise O’Keeffe was aged eight when she was abused at Dunderrow National School in Cork in 1973 by principal Leo Hickey. Complaints had been made against him but, in line with Department of Education policy then, these were directed to the local priest. Hickey remained at the school, perpetrating more than 400 counts of abuse against at least 20 victims. Following further allegations, he resigned and moved to another school, where he taught for a further 22 years until his retirement in 1995. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to 21 sample charges relating to the sexual abuse of girls under his care and was sentenced to three years in prison. O’Keeffe took legal action for damages, but the courts ruled the department was not liable because the school was under Catholic Church management, even though the State paid Hickey’s salary. She appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which in 2014 found Ireland had failed to protect O’Keeffe from Hickey while at school. It said the State, when relinquishing control of education, should have been aware of the potential risks and put in place safeguards given its obligation to protect children. By failing to put in place adequate child-protection measures until the early 1990s at primary and second level, O’Mahony said the court found “the Irish State had a stand-alone culpability for breach of convention rights, independent of any other actor”. “The Irish government interpreted the ruling as meaning it was only liable for damages in cases where there had been a prior complaint against an abuser,” he said. O’Mahony said that while O’Keeffe was awarded damages, it was unfortunate that the scheme was “designed from its inception to make it almost impossible to receive compensation”. “Only one-third of the budget of €31 million allocated to the scheme was paid out. Most of the people abused by the same teacher as Louise O’Keeffe [was] would not have qualified for payments under the scheme – which demonstrates the bizarre logic at work,” he said. “Very simply, the 2014 O’Keeffe judgment demands that every child who experienced sexual abuse in a defective child protection framework in schools be compensated for that abuse. The Government needs to match words with action for the first time on this matter.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto’s Wild West Era Is Over

For more than a decade, cryptocurrency lived in a regulatory gray zone. Loved by libertarians, feared by bankers, and mocked by lawmakers, it was treated like a side project of the internet, too weird to regulate and too volatile to embrace. That era just ended. The U.S. House of Representatives has officially passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that sets federal rules for stablecoinsâthe digital currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump, making it the first major piece of crypto legislation in American history. It is the moment crypto has been waiting for: real rules, real recognition, and real legitimacy. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are already used to move billions of dollars every day. They’re the quiet workhorses of cryptoâused to send money across borders, trade on crypto exchanges, and settle payments instantly without touching a traditional bank. But until now, there were no federal laws clearly defining how they should work, what they must be backed by, or who should regulate them. That uncertainty scared away banks, blocked innovation, and left consumers vulnerable. The GENIUS Act changes that. It requires stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves in cash or U.S. Treasury bills. It enforces monthly disclosures. It gives consumers priority if an issuer goes bankrupt. It creates a path for both federal and state-level oversight. In short, it gives crypto the kind of legal foundation that big institutionsâand average Americansâcan finally trust. This law isnât just about taming crypto. Itâs about launching the next era of American finance. Stablecoins are already powering instant global payments. In the future, they could be integrated into everyday appsâused to pay rent, send money to family, or settle business transactions in seconds. With the GENIUS Act, the U.S. is staking a claim to lead that future. At a time when countries like China are racing to launch their own state-backed digital currencies, this law sends a clear message: America wonât be left behind. It also opens the door for crypto to leave the speculative Wild West and move into the financial mainstream. Companies like PayPal, Visa, and BlackRock are already building on blockchain rails. Now, they can do it with a legal framework behind them. For years, crypto has been dismissed as a sideshow. Critics called it a scam, a bubble, or a toy for rich tech bros. There was some truth to the chaos. But behind the scenes, a new financial infrastructure was being built: faster, programmable, and radically transparent. With this new law, that infrastructure gets its first real seal of approval from Washington. Itâs not just about price anymore. Itâs about permanence. The GENIUS Act is just the beginning. More legislation is coming, covering digital asset securities, smart contract standards, and decentralized platforms. But this bill proves Congress can act. That alone is a major shift in the political landscape. In the next few years, you may not even realize youâre using crypto. It will just be how money moves: instantly, digitally, securely. And legally. Crypto is no longer knocking on the door. Itâs walking in. Bitcoinpolicyregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Congress just passed its biggest crypto law ever, and Bitcoin didnât even get a mention. Once the face of financial rebellion, itâs now sidelined while stablecoins take the spotlight. The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30âbut the rules are murky, and the government hasnât said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The worldâs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally. As Brussels moves to regulate AI, the Trump administration is retaliating with steep tariffs, pushing the two powers closer to an all-out trade war that could reshape the global internet.

Title: If Mamdani Sinks the Democrats, So What?

What’s wrong with New Yorkers electing Zohran Mamdani mayor? Seriously. He’s a socialist, isn’t he? He’ll wreck New York City, you say. But didn’t that process start with Bill DeBlasio? Do you think that process ends electing Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams? Perennial candidate Curtis Silwa is a savior? Hasn’t socialism been the road Democrats have been traveling for decades? When Mamdani’s socialist experiment crashes and burns, maybe it’ll persuade New Yorkers to abandon Democrats. Maybe independents decide to swing Republican. JFK-style liberals began vanishing after Kennedy’s assassination. Mamdani’s election would make it obvious what should be obvious. Liberalism, progressivism -- call it whatever -- is a ruse. The Democrat Party tilts full Left. Trends are making it more so. Mamdani will pursue an agenda that’s part utopian drivel, Soviet-style top-down, and plenty of Cuban incompetence leading to dysfunctional public services, higher costs, and increasing scarcity. Dead Russians and living Cubans can testify to what glorious utopia brings. A broken Democrat Party is a public necessity. Big failure means bigger brokenness. Let’s not hear nonsense from “good government” Republicans that a healthy two-party system profits the nation. Life isn’t a civics class. Franklin Roosevelt didn’t give a damn about anything other than healthy Democrat dominance. Jacksonian Democrats and Lincoln and McKinley Republicans believed no differently. When did Republicans go softheaded? Let dogmatic Democrats stumble in the wilderness for a generation or more. A Trumpian sea change completes in two ways: the president keeps racking up Ws and Democrats continue to misgovern, driven by extreme policies. (Senator Dave McCormick’s energy and AI summit held at Carnegie Mellon University this past week showcased more huge wins for the president. Colossal benefits are expected for the economy, regionally and nationally.) A busted Democrat party isn’t just about narrow partisan advantage. Clearing out Democrats is pivotal. MAGA is about the nation returning to its core values… about building a freer, more prosperous America. Smarter Democrat operatives see their party teetering. From The Hill, July 14: “Sadly, Democrats are still stuck in the same mud that they were in six months ago,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. “We are still as unpopular as we were when Trump was inaugurated in January.” An unnamed strategist went further, stating: “This is a nightmare scenario for the Dems right now,” the strategist said. “We better pray long and hard that the country is going to be in a fâââing depression, because I don’t know how else we find ourselves out of this mess.” Mamdani is running mask off. Give the guy credit. Indoctrinated young left-wingers proclaim socialism is the future. How many times before have we heard that? Plenty of these cultists live in the Big Apple. Posted former college professor Newt Gingrich at X, July 15: Mamdani’s supporters are not the well educated young the media describes. They are the well brainwashed young. The more elite the school you went to the more likely you are to be brainwashed rather than educated. They could vote for Mamdani to turn New York City into Caracas and they would have no idea how much damage they will have done. As Mark Twain said “It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.” Welcome to Mandani land[.] Newt, these young are social inbreds. Their parents’ money has insulated them from life’s grittier realities. U.S. history has been spoon-fed to them by radical leftist teachers and professors. America is evil. Light-lift liberal arts degrees from high-dollar universities impart the illusion of being elite on merit. Ivy League alumni take care of each other. Life in Manhattan and Brooklyn -- NYC’s priciest boroughs -- is easier with mommy’s and daddy’s credit cards handy. Entry-level jobs are for public college grunges. The newer brand of Democrats are stepping off college campuses as bold radicals. Consider the life issue. Not long ago, pro-abortion advocates went to great pains to call themselves pro-choice. Now, most of them proclaim that they’re pro-abortion. Killing a baby in the womb up to birth has acquired trophy status. Women must be empowered, they shout. Sleeping around and career fulfillment rank higher than a baby’s life. We’re only now seeing the consequences to older women who bought the tripe. They’re spouseless and childless. Do cats and chardonnay fill voids? Mamdani’s platform is pretty darn red. The redder the platform, the greater the disaster in the offing. That’s good because an epic implosion is needed. The platform is packed with the same garbage that “progressives” peddle in Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Austin, and Los Angeles -- six cities that are in various stages of ruin. DEI and woke twaddle and more carveouts for 3% of the population that’s drowning in the delusion called “LGBTQIA+” are platform worthy. Any room for better policing along the lines of Giuliani’s and Bloomberg’s highly effective broken windows policies? Nope. Instead, criminals require intervention and therapy. Mamdani proposes a “Department of Community Safety,” which other blue cities mirror in some fashion. New Yorkers, if you think crime is bad now, just wait. Mamdani means to enact an all-in, go-for-broke socialism in the Big Apple. Remarked ex-congressman Dean Phillips (D-MN) on CNN, July10: “Anyone who talks about seizing the means of production or opening government-run grocery stores is at great odds with most of the country[.]” That’s an affirmative, Dean. That may be why New York’s business movers-and-shakers skipped a meet-and-greet with Mamdani. As Charles Gasparino reported, New York Post, July 15: The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the [NYC] Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nation’s largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nation’s second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Gasparino continued: Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Mamdani vows to hike taxes on “corporations and the 1%.” Wait for the deafening sound of money rushing out of NYC next year. Governors Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis must be licking their chops. FBI deputy director Dan Bongino -- a native New Yorker -- has said that things won’t change for the better in New York until things get worse. Electing Mamdani would be worse. The Big Apple is headed for a helluva a rough ride if polls are true. That’s too bad for New Yorkers who have no easy exit. But Mamdani’s election and the city’s subsequent fall will provide a searing lesson for voters everywhere. Not only is socialism a pox, but Democrats are the carriers. Mamdani’s election might spark a chain reaction. Blue state and city elected leaders will probably try to out-socialist Mamdani. Then, as havoc spreads, watch the out-migrations accelerate. People will be tripping over themselves to flee dysfunctional communities. Let’s hope that migrants leave their politics behind. Whatever. Independent voters matter more. Working folk and middle-class wage-earners are in tune with Trump’s policies. Hispanics increasingly so. And some blacks. Democrats, mired in the La Brea Tar Pits of socialist dogma, and mucking up everything, coupled with more Trump victories, are the recipe for a new majority dedicated to -- you guessed it -- making America great again. About the Big Apple, Frank Sinatra once crooned, “If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere. It's up to you, New York, New York.” It certainly is up to you, New York, New York. More about how you survive Mamdani. Good luck with that. J. Robert Smith can be found at X. His handle is @JRobertSmith1. At Gab, @JRobertSmith. He blogs occasionally at Flyover.

Title: Ads of the Week: Duck boats, Chalamet quirks, milk musicals and ketchup devotion

Full Content:
Advertisement July 18, 2025 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min When hot dogs steal the show, duck boats double as training films, and Timothée Chalamet shops for cattle feed, you know advertising is having a week. These campaigns prove that wit, weirdness, and well-placed heart can turn everyday products into cultural side characters worth rooting for. 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way / Chesapeake Bank Why it works: It tosses out the usual banking tropes in favor of local charm, employee cameos, and a duck boat to prove community banking doesn’t have to be boring. To celebrate 125 years in business, Chesapeake Bank teamed up with agency Familiar Creatures for a campaign that is part ad, part onboarding film, and fully committed to authenticity. Titled 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way, the centerpiece is a 1:45 minute hero spot filmed aboard a duck boat cruising through small-town Virginia, starring actual employees and local characters. Rather than lean on stock footage or corporate buzzwords, the campaign embraces oddball humor and lo-fi storytelling. With nods to Wes Anderson, the spot doubles as a real onboarding video for new hires, highlighting the bank’s values through crochet references, desk décor, and real-life crab cake stunts. The duck boat driver is the actual owner. The crab cake is a 400-pound beast served to baseball fans in Richmond. From social clips like Is That a Duck Boat? to bite-sized 30- and 15-second cutdowns, the campaign taps into regional pride with a knowing wink. It’s a rare example of a financial brand leading with personality over polish, proving that relatability and local flavor can still break through in a category built on sameness. Why it works: It skips fintech jargon in favor of surreal humor and star power, making people curious about money in a fresh way. Cash App’s newest ad taps into Timothée Chalamet’s signature eccentricity. The actor wanders a store filled with strange produce before selecting a mangelwurzel, an obscure root vegetable often used as animal feed. When he tries to pay, the scene shifts into a generational debate about outdated currencies like salt and cowrie shells. The two-minute spot was developed by Cash App’s in-house team, directed by Aidan Zamiri, and written by Elijah Bynum. It’s airing in theaters ahead of Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, with OOH placements in New York and Los Angeles. A co-designed limited-edition Cash App Card stamp with Chalamet is also on the way. It’s a stylized, offbeat campaign that avoids the usual product pitch and instead makes a cultural statement about how we think and talk about money. Why it works: It turns the daily grind of motherhood into a stage-worthy performance, with milk as the quiet but powerful co-star. MilkPep’s latest campaign, Mom’s Show Must Go On, is a high-energy tribute to moms who juggle snack time, tantrums and living-room dance breaks like pros. Rolled out across TikTok, Netflix, Meta and YouTube, the campaign embraces the humor and mess of parenting while drawing a direct line to milk’s role in keeping moms going. Created by agency Gale, the work casts mothers as lead performers in the everyday theater of home life, with kids as their discerning audience. The creative blends relatable chaos with playful spectacle, making milk feel less like a nutritional box to check and more like a backstage essential. The campaign follows MilkPep’s recent efforts to keep dairy relevant in modern culture, trading nostalgia for emotional honesty and short-form storytelling. It’s a smart shift that connects with parents on a personal level while quietly reinforcing milk’s value. Advertisement Why it works: It turns a safety concern into a simple, actionable idea that empowers parents without talking down to them. Tesco Mobile’s latest campaign addresses a growing gap between generations. As digital slang evolves, nearly half of parents and caregivers admit they struggle to understand the way kids communicate online. To bridge that gap, the brand launched a series of outdoor, radio, and digital ads that decode terms commonly used by young people—some of which may carry more serious meanings than they appear. Created by BBH London, the campaign builds on cultural momentum around online safety, sparked in part by Netflix’s Adolescence, which highlighted how emojis and casual slang can hide risky behavior. The goal is to help parents feel more confident, equipping them to spot red flags and open conversations with their kids. By packaging digital literacy into a clear, creative format, Tesco Mobile positions itself as more than a service provider, it becomes a partner in parenting. It transforms sustainability from a feature into a full-blown creative concept that feels fun, not preachy. To launch its new upcycled ‘Stracciatella Saddle,’ Italian cycling brand Selle Royal leaned into whimsy with a musical stop-motion film that spotlights circular design. Built from discarded saddle materials and foam offcuts, the saddle’s marbled pattern recalls the classic stracciatella gelato—making a virtue of its recycled roots. Created by Milan-based agency Adverteam, the campaign centers on Stracciatella Fella, a frame-by-frame animated film crafted from over 2,000 photographs. Using miniature sets, clay figures, and actual recycled foam fragments, the spot turns reuse into a story of reinvention. The campaign is a smart example of how eco-conscious innovation can be marketed through entertainment rather than education, giving Selle Royal cultural texture and personality in a category that often plays it safe. Advertisement Why it works: It captures a universal truth with humor and clarity: when the food hits just right, nothing else matters. In Lost in Love, Heinz’s latest European campaign, a tennis fan is completely absorbed in his ketchup-covered hot dog, tuning out the match around him as if the world has disappeared. The moment is simple, funny, and instantly relatable. Developed by Wieden+Kennedy and Heinz’s in-house agency The Kitchen, the campaign is rolling out across the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Italy. It is the first time Heinz has launched a campaign simultaneously across its European markets, with a consistent presence on TV, social and out-of-home. By focusing on one irresistible moment of taste, the work reinforces Heinz's brand promise without overexplaining. It is product-led storytelling with just the right amount of charm. Why it works: It strips away the usual supermarket noise and replaces it with quiet, human moments that feel instantly familiar. In a category packed with price flashes and glossy product shots, Ocado’s Shopping List Stories takes a softer approach. Created by Uncommon Creative Studio, the campaign pairs understated shopping lists with emotionally resonant images, from a blurred photo of a handhold to snapshots of birthdays, breakups, and everything in between. Each list hints at a deeper story. One simply reads: “One tin of Ocado Gold Roast Instant Coffee. Zero words.” It’s minimalist, but it lands with unexpected weight. This outdoor-focused campaign isn’t trying to shout louder than its competitors. Instead, it invites viewers to pause, connect, and remember that behind every grocery order is a life being lived. That shift in tone makes Ocado feel more thoughtful and more human without ever needing to show a price tag. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Anti-DEI Shareholder Proposals Are Failing, But Not Because Of Politics

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order to appoint Chris ... More Rocheleau as the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump also signed a memorandum ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety and ordering an elevation of what he called “competence” over “D.E.I.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Shareholders are overwhelmingly voting down proposals to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at top companies. The rejection of anti-DEI proposals is emboldening advocates who view it as a clear statement by investors that they are rejecting conservative policies and as an admonishment of President Trump. However, the rejections were not about politics, rather about the process and nature of the shareholder votes. Simply, the proposals were doomed to fail. Republicans in the U.S. have taken a strong stance against DEI programs, calling them discriminatory. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Justice has made it clear they view DEI programs as illegal and will be using the office to prosecute violators, stating the “Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division will investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector…” This creates a clear threat of legal liability against companies wishing to engage in DEI practices. Conservative groups are also taking the issue directly to companies During the 2025 proxy season, the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, submitted the majority of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals in 2025. The proposals referenced a series of cases, including Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that ruled race-based admissions are unconstitutional. As I noted in 2023, the Court’s opinion was a major blow to ESG and DEI, even though it did not directly address those issues in the corporate world. Other cases and the actions by the DOJ are connecting DEI as illegal discrimination. While there may be legal merits to some of NCPPR’s arguments, the format of the shareholder proposal made passage nearly impossible. This has caused confusion as to the intent of corporate management versus their actions, causing activists to find false hope. However, a look at the type of proposals provides needed context. Proposals submitted to the shareholders for approval come in the form of management proposals and shareholder proposals. Management proposals originate from the board of directors of the company. They have been vetted and worked through a clear process. As a result, those tend to have a high passage rate. Shareholder proposals originate from individuals or organizations that own shares in the company. Each company has its own process for how a shareholder can introduce a proposal for approval by the shareholders. Typically, shareholder proposals are only a small fraction of the total proposals. Shareholder proposals also have a much lower passage rate. According a BlackRock report, only 867 shareholder proposals were voted on in the 2023 - 2024 proxy year, compared to 168,400 management proposals. During that year, BlackRock only voted in favor of 99 of the shareholder proposals, approximately 11.4% of them. This has been consistent as BlackRock states they generally follow management for the direction of a company, while shareholder proposals tend to be in conflict with management proposals. A study by Cooley of the 2025 proxy season showed similar results, stating that 3000 companies received 830 shareholder proposals in the 2025 proxy year. Looking at overall support, not passage rate, shareholder proposals relating to governance issues only received 35% support, environmental proposals received 13% support, and social proposals received 12% support. No DEI proposals passed, either in support or in opposition of the programs. The lack of support for shareholder proposals is institutional and driven by the large financial management companies, like BlackRock, that tend to support management proposals at a much higher rate, while overwhelming rejecting shareholder proposals. This has led to confusion of policies as people attach meaning to the vote that is not tied to the stated rationale. This misunderstanding of the shareholder proposal votes is not new. I wrote about this issue in August 2024, when BlackRock was accused of pulling support of ESG. The accusations were based on BlackRock’s votes against shareholder proposals that called for a larger focus on ESG. In BlackRock’s 2024 Global Voting Spotlight, released in August 2024, the company stated “our analysis indicates that a relatively small number of shareholder proponents and advocacy groups filed the majority of proposals at U.S.-based companies – with fewer than 10 filing approximately 80% of proposals in the 2023-24 proxy year. Based on our review of proxy materials, these proponents often filed similar proposals at multiple companies, regardless of the specifics of their sectors or business models.” The BlackRock report also stated, “we still observed many poor-quality proposals come to a vote, particularly on proposals that attempted to address climate and natural capital or company impacts on people-related issues. Consistent with last year, we found the majority of proposals addressing these topics were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value. A significant percentage were focused on business risks that companies already had processes in place to address, making them redundant.” The same rationale was offered in opposition of the anti-DEI proposals. In response to a proposal made to Apply by NCPPR, management stated the proposal “is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program. The proposal also inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.” Dick’s Sporting Goods offered a similar response, stating “we already have well established compliance and risk oversight programs and processes…” Others used similar language. The argument by management is simply that this is an issue that should not be adopted by shareholders. Instead, it is a risk and compliance issue that should be addressed by management. As the legal landscape changes, the company needs to be able to adapt without the confines of a shareholder vote. While DEI advocates will use the failure of the anti-DEI shareholder proposals as a sign that the tide is shifting against Trump, the data shows that is is just business as usual.

Title: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit Record $726M—BlackRock Alone Drew $500M

Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have just seen their biggest day of inflows, driven largely by demand on BlackRock and Fidelity. According to data from Farside Investors, July 16th was a big day for the US Ethereum spot ETFs, with total inflows crossing the $726 million mark, a new all-time high (ATH). The spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this means that ETF holders don’t have to manage digital asset wallets or navigate exchanges. For traditional investors, this fact can make spot ETFs a convenient way to explore the market. Ethereum spot ETFs gained approval in the US nearly one year ago. Since then, demand has varied, but the asset has lately been on a positive run of inflows, with the most recent numbers showing momentum is only accelerating. Below is a table that shows how the netflow related to the various Ethereum spot ETFs has looked during the last couple of weeks. As is visible, notable daily inflows of around $200 million or more were already happening into the US Ethereum spot ETFs during the past week, indicating that demand from institutional entities was solid, but with the latest record-breaking day, things have clearly kicked into an even higher gear. BlackRock’s ETHA saw the largest share of July 16th inflows at almost $500 million. Fidelity’s FETH was a distant second, purchasing about $133 million in the cryptocurrency on behalf of its users.Capital has poured into the spot ETFs as Ethereum has seen a breakout above the $3,000 level, which has so far brought it to $3,400 for the first time since January. Following this rally, institutional investors aren’t the only ones paying attention to ETH, as data from the analytics firm Santiment shows a spike in retail interest. In the chart, Santiment has attached the data of the Social Dominance, an indicator that tells us about the discussion share that Ethereum occupies on the major social media platforms relative to other cryptocurrencies. Since retail investors far outweigh the larger holders in terms of numbers, this metric ends up reflecting the behavior of the small hands. From the graph, it’s apparent that the ETH Social Dominance has seen a huge spike alongside the price surge, with 13.4% of all digital asset discussions on social media now involving the coin. Clearly, retail is taking note of the asset now, but historically, overhype among the crowd is something that has tended not to end well for cryptocurrencies, so this trend could be one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,400, up more than 23% over the last week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Amazon’s AWS has joined the AI agent craze. Now the real work of showing Fortune 500 companies how to actually use them begins

Time Published: 2025-07-17T22:56:17Z

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon Web Services joined the agentic AI frenzy in a big way this week, revealing at a New York City event Wednesday a host of services and tools dubbed Agentcore that let technologists build and deploy so-called AI agents capable of automating internal tasks while potentially overhauling the way consumers interact with online businesses too. These agents, to many in the tech industry, are the next evolution in our new AI-powered future, where artificial intelligence not only acts as an assistant, but can autonomously complete complex multi-step actions with just some human intervention in sensitive sectors like healthcare, and no human intervention in lower-risk areas. But at least in the short term, the real battle between AWS and agentic AI competitors may depend less on technology differentiation, and more on who employs the most quality talent to help guide large corporations on where to even begin with AI agents. Businesses “are frustrated because they want someone to tell them what to do and how to do it,” Dave Nicholson, chief technology advisor at The Futurum Group, told Fortune. “There isn’t enough [talent] to go around. Humans are the bottleneck.” Nicholson added that AWS and other cloud and large tech companies will need to heavily lean on partner companies to assist with customer education and implementation too. The business case for agents was pushed into the forefront last year by Salesforce, with the announcement of a new division it calls Agentforce. Google, OpenAI and other cloud and technology players have since rushed to announce AI agent tools and services geared toward corporations. On Thursday, a day after AWS’s showed off its agent tools, OpenAI announced a new, general purpose agent for users of its ChatGPT product. With just about every CEO these days under pressure to craft an AI strategy, the incoming AI agents may be poised to capitalize on the situation. “This is the highest level of ‘fear of missing out’ ever among behemoths in the IT industry right now,” Nicholson said. “These are existential decisions being made at Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.” In an interview with Fortune after his keynote presentation announcing a new in-house collection of agent-building services dubbed AgentCore as well as a marketplace for agents, AWS VP of agentic AI, Swami Sivasubramanian said that Fortune 500 execs whose companies don’t start experimenting with the technology risk missing out on a transformational moment as pivotal as the creation of the internet. “Agents are fundamentally going to change how we work and how we live,” Sivasubramanian said when asked how execs at Fortune 500 companies can be sure that their investments in building or deploying AI agents isn’t supplanted by a new shiny technology of the moment next year. The executive provided an example of how AI technologies will make it feasible for an agent to, for example, not only plan an itinerary for a trip, but do all of the bookings too. “You can give it a high level objective, like, ‘Hey, create me a 10 day itinerary in December to visit Australia,'” he said. “It actually understands the objective. Breaks it down into…I need a flight, I need activities to go see in these cities, and then, based on my preferences, it creates a customized itinerary, and actually also secures reservations by calling APIs.” That’s the type of personal, tangible, example that gives this AWS executive and other proponents of AI agents, the belief that many customer experiences can be overhauled, or created from scratch, with this technology — in ways that might even be hard to envision now. Slick as some of these scenarios may sound however, the reality is that there are currently few examples of corporations using agents at massive scale. The green field of opportunity is sure to be attractive for some, but it’s also a big challenge for the companies selling agentic products and tools since there are not many real-world examples to guide or inspire. Amazon Web Services’ market leadership in cloud computing should serve as some advantage, providing a large existing customer base to sell to. And because those companies’ operations are already dependent on AWS, they have more patience for any bumps Amazon experiences as it refines its AI agent business. “They’re more likely to get two or three strikes,” Nicholson said of AWS and its AI agent rollout. But it’s an open question whether AWS’ initial focus on heavily marketing its new agentic tools to software developers versus the executives with the purse strings will prove problematic. “They have disjointed messaging,” Mark Beccue, an analyst at the research firm Omdia, told TechTarget. “When talking about agents, you must have the complete story.” AWS’ Sivasubramanian said that most C-suite customers that he meets with naturally look inward to how their own organization runs when considering where and how to deploy AI agents first to help automate, or reduce the time to complete, boring, repetitive tasks. This, of course, raises the question of when and how AI agents will disrupt or displace jobs and in which areas. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently weighed in on the overall AI boom in an employee memo, saying that while these technologies will both eliminate current roles while creating new ones, “we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce [over the next few years] as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” On Thursday, a day after AWS’ agent-focused summit, the company carried out layoffs of at least hundreds of employees. A day earlier, Sivasubramanian, perhaps not surprisingly, struck an optimistic tone when discussing a new world full of AI agents that now Amazon — and many rivals — are rushing to bring to fruition. “Yes, in the short term, if you look at [past] transformations, there were actually changes on the specific job categories [in which people worked], “but then we as humans have really adapted to these changes and then started working on different things. You don’t find people who are doing Y2K engineering anymore.” Are you a current or former AWS employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Title: Is AI Coming For Your Team Next? How AI Hype Is Becoming The Hot Layoff Excuse

Rani Salehi, Principal Analyst If headlines are any indication, AI-driven downsizing is accelerating across B2B organizations. It seems that many senior executives have found “the perfect justification” for the workforce optimization they’ve been contemplating. The AI revolution isn’t only changing how work gets done — it’s providing cover for workforce reductions that may have little to do with actual capabilities. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO, indicated that “[with AI, we] will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in a note to employees. Meanwhile, AI is enabling Hewlett Packard Enterprise to reduce staff that it once needed. For example, the company has deployed AI agents in finance that are already displacing workers. Marie Myers, the company’s finance chief, recently spoke to investors as she justified eliminating 2,500 jobs (or 5% of HPE’s workforce): “Our ambition is clear: a leaner, faster, and more competitive organization. Nothing is off limits.” IBM’s CEO has also gone on record, stating that the company has laid off 8,000 workers already, mostly in HR, in favor of using AI agents. These and other job reduction numbers expose the growing scope of the AI-justified downsizing wave. US public companies have slashed professional staff by 3.5% over the past three years, and the recent AI-justified reductions are poised to balloon this figure further, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis of Live Data Technologies’ tracking across the labor market. Yes, we’ve also been operating in a volatile economic market, but here’s what makes this different from typical recession-driven layoffs: This isn’t about cuts for economic survival — it’s about workforce optimization disguised as technological inevitability. The high-profile examples at Amazon, HPE, and IBM aren’t isolated incidents. They’re part of a growing trend where AI hype is fueling permanent staffing decisions based on limited pilots and, mostly, theoretical technological promises rather than full-fledged implementation realities. The heart of the problem? Most executives can’t actually distinguish between what AI can do and what requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship management. Here’s the twist: The executives making these cuts often don’t believe that AI is a replacement for employees. According to Forrester’s State Of AI Survey, 2025, 75% of business leaders agree that AI isn’t a replacement for employees, and 80% agree that AI will mostly augment capabilities rather than replace them. Yet paradoxically, 58% have slowed their hiring until they know more about how AI will impact their operations. This disconnect between stated beliefs and actual decisions reveals the real motivation for AI-driven downsizing — it’s not solely about AI capabilities; it’s about AI as cover for workforce optimization, too. This contradiction highlights why organizations need to ground their workforce AI strategy in human experience rather than chasing theoretical efficiency gains that are likely to fail to materialize or backfire. But let me be clear: AI is delivering value today. In B2B marketing, we see it being used for content development, competitive intelligence, routine task automation, mining customer data insights, and other use cases. But it is far too early to justify major across-the-board headcount changes based on nascent efforts. Organizations and individuals who want to survive this shift must move beyond reactive thinking. Here’s what you should do in the next 30–90 days: Ready to future-proof your marketing organization against the next wave of workforce optimization? Contact me to discuss data-driven strategies for navigating the AI personnel and automation revolution in B2B marketing. Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.

Today, we look at the LMBA’s nascent silver short squeeze. (See the Precious Metals section.) The Comex shorts did their best to hold down the price of silver again this week. But the Asian traders kept bidding it back up into the $38.20 to $38.50 USD range. The word is out that the LBMA has nearly exhausted its supply of physically warehoused silver available for delivery. The exchange now holds less than 160 million physical ounces. Keep in mind that more than 200 million ounces worth of silver contracts are cleared there, daily. But most of those are “paper for paper” transactions — not physical deliveries. What happens if and when more buyers start to demand delivery? This could get ugly. (For the Shorts, that is. Not for us silver stackers.

Title: U.S. retail sales bounce around in a whipsaw trade environment

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Consumers picked up their spending in June after an earlier pullback, despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after two consecutive months of spending declines, a 0.1% pullback in April and a 0.9% slowdown in May. Earlier in the year, strong retail sales were driven by car sales as Americans attempted to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. The erratic spending is taking place during a period of mixed signals about the economy as well. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, but the U.S. job market is proving to be very resilient, and major tariffs keep getting postponed. Americans continue to spend in that environment with a heavy focus on necessities, rather than electronics or new appliances. Yet consumers haven't stopped spending on nonessential goods. Sales at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, rose moderately. “Consumers are only feeling a modest amount of pressure from tariffs, and any weakness here is not having much of an effect in forcing them to pull back on more discretionary areas of spending such as restaurants and bars,” wrote William Blair’s macro analyst Richard de Chazal. Yet Chazal fears that the administration may picking up false assurances from strong consumer spending. Consumer sentiment and markets have tumbled after aggressive tariff announcements. Retail sales in June included a 1.2% gain in sales of autos and auto parts. Spending expanded across most major categories including clothing and personal care. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Electronics and appliance retailers, furniture stores and department stores all saw sales declines. A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet," said Long in a statement. "There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. For businesses, that has made it harder to manage supply and inventories. Americans are focusing more on necessities, when they do shop. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs. Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes. One big litmus test was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs.

Title: Trump Prepares To Allow Crypto Investments In $9 Trillion Retirement Market

President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to open the $9 trillion retirement market to a range of alternative investments, including crypto, gold, and private equity. According to the Financial Times, this initiative is expected to be formalized through an executive order as early as this week. It seeks to diversify the investment options available within 401(k) plans, which have traditionally been limited to stocks and bonds. Trump’s forthcoming executive order will direct regulatory agencies to explore the necessary adjustments to facilitate the inclusion of these alternative asset classes in professionally managed retirement funds. According to insiders familiar with the plan, this shift aims to enable American workers to invest their retirement savings in a broader spectrum of opportunities, including digital assets, metals, and funds that focus on private loans and corporate takeovers. This executive order marks a significant acceleration in Trump’s efforts to mainstream cryptocurrency investments. His administration has already taken steps to ease regulatory burdens, notably by reversing a Biden-era policy that discouraged the inclusion of crypto options in retirement accounts. The recent passage of three crypto-related bills by the House, which Trump has vocally supported, further underscores his commitment to bolster the digital asset industry. The implications of opening the retirement market to private equity are vast. Major capital groups, including Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, have expressed keen interest in gaining access to 401(k) funds, which they view as a potential source of hundreds of billions in new assets. However, the push to integrate less liquid private investments into retirement plans carries inherent risks. Higher fees and reduced transparency regarding asset valuations may pose challenges for plan administrators and investors alike.

Highlights Amazon is betting it can build the future fast enough to absorb the present’s pressures. Walmart is banking on operational excellence and brand reinvention to buy time.

Δ Sitting at the intersection of geopolitical headwinds, U.S. tariffs, AI disruption and an increasingly cost-conscious consumer, the question hanging over the retail industry is this: Can anyone thrive when the shopper won’t save them? While extended sales events like Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart+ Week were once celebratory bonanzas of consumption, this year they felt more like high-stakes stress tests of brand agility, pricing power and technological readiness. Amazon’s extended four-day Prime Day drove billions in sales, but beneath the surface, it exposed a consumer increasingly focused on sub-$20 essentials and less interested in big-ticket impulse buys. The average household spend — $156 — was roughly flat year over year, even as inflation cooled. Walmart, responding in kind, leaned heavily on its Walmart+ Week campaign to underscore “everyday low prices,” particularly on school supplies, which it advertised as costing less than last year. Meanwhile, Target and Sam’s Club froze prices on seasonal items to maintain loyalty amid looming tariff threats on imports from China. But the move may signal desperation as much as differentiation: Target’s sales and stock are both in decline, and CEO Brian Cornell’s exit has thrown future strategy into question. See also: Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability At the center of the ongoing retail transformation is a consumer cohort that is more cautious, more tech-savvy and more values-driven than ever before. Demographically, Gen Z and younger millennials are driving new expectations. They want personalized experiences, instant fulfillment and ethical transparency. They’re also more likely to toggle between online and offline seamlessly — expecting their digital cart to follow them from app to aisle. Financially, the mood is somber. Student loan repayments have resumed. Mortgage rates remain elevated. Tariffs are crunching margins. And while inflation is technically slowing, the feel of financial strain lingers. PYMNTS Intelligence research found that more than 8 in 10 consumers are taking measures to offset the financial impact of tariffs on their bank accounts. “In fact, the average individual is making nearly five such behavioral changes, and 44% of consumers have already changed their shopping habits in response to tariff-induced price pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. This cocktail of economic anxiety and digital fluency has created a demanding, paradoxical shopper: loyal to value but fickle with brands; frugal with spending but potentially generous with praise for standout experiences. Read more: Retailers in Mexico Face Pressure to Unify In-Store and Mobile Journeys If price defense is the cost of entry, technological innovation is the new battleground — and no two players are approaching it the same way. Amazon is doubling down on scale and vertical control. Not only did it leverage Prime Day to reinforce its consumer grip, but it’s also pushing ahead on two transformative fronts: cloud artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous retail infrastructure. Its AWS division is reportedly launching a marketplace for AI agents, further embedding generative intelligence into business services. Behind the scenes, Amazon is expanding fulfillment centers, deploying predictive AI to optimize inventory, and eyeing another multibillion-dollar stake in Anthropic, one of the most advanced AI labs in the world. Walmart, by contrast, is embedding smarter tools at the associate level. The company is cutting hundreds of store support roles, but reallocating resources to train frontline employees with AI-enhanced operational tools — including real-time inventory checks, task automation and natural language assistance. While Amazon is centralizing its AI ecosystem, Walmart is distributing intelligence at the edge. While Amazon and Walmart throw billions at transformation, mid-market retailers are being crushed by indecision. Lacking the scale to out-price Walmart or the tech stack to compete with Amazon, brands like Kohl’s, Macy’s and regional grocers are increasingly vulnerable. Some are trying to unify digital and in-store experiences, as seen in Mexico where retailers are under pressure to blend mobile and physical journeys to meet rising consumer expectations. But building omnichannel infrastructure is capital-intensive — and in this environment, capital is tight. Even Costco, long immune to cyclical spending dips, is leaning more heavily on non-food categories and fresh food to drive a modest 5.8% sales bump. It’s a strong number in a tough climate, but it also signals that volume, not margin, is doing the heavy lifting.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher Thursday as a report revealed an increase in retail sales in June, suggesting that consumer spending remains strong despite tariff concerns. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% to reach a record closing high, surpassing the all-time mark set by the benchmark index a week ago. The Dow also added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, extending its string of consecutive record-setting daily closes to four. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Snap-On (SNA) shares rose 7.9%, scoring Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of professional tools topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company highlighted the resilience of its gross margins despite trade-related uncertainties, a return to sales growth in its U.S. tools segment, and strong sales from its vehicle diagnostic and repair information products. Lithium prices gained ground after China's Zangge Mining said it stopped lithium production in Qinghai province following directives from local officials. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, surged 7.6%. Albemarle and other producers have cut employees and reduced expansion plans as they navigate a prolonged slump in the price of the key battery component. PepsiCo (PEP) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter, and shares of the soft-drink and snack-food giant jumped 7.5%. The parent company of brands like Mountain Dew and Lay's potato chips offered a slightly improved forecast for core profits in 2025, noting that the weaker U.S. dollar contributed to its earnings outlook. Elevance Health (ELV) shares plunged 12.2%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday. The parent of the Wellpoint, Anthem, and Carelon healthcare services fell short of quarterly profit estimates and lowered its full-year forecast, citing higher costs for Affordable Care Act and Medicaid coverage. Other health insurance stocks also moved lower. Molina Healthcare (MOH) shares slipped 5.5%, while shares of Centene (CNC), which pulled its full-year guidance earlier this month amid cost pressures, sank 4.2%. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue and adjusted profit but narrowed its full-year outlook. The drugmaker reported a year-over-year sales decline in its diagnostics segment, pressured by drop in demand for COVID-19 tests, although sales in its nutrition and established pharmaceuticals businesses were higher than a year ago. Abbott shares fell 8.5%. Second-quarter profits from advertising and media firm Omnicom (OMC) were down year-over-year, reflecting elevated costs related to the ongoing acquisition of competitor Interpublic Group (IPG). Shares of both Omnicom and Interpublic Group closed Thursday's session more than 4% lower.

Adding staking functionality to the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) would allow the product, which debuted last July, to earn yield by using the held ETH to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, according to the 19b-4 proposal. Multiple issuers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and 21Shares, are also seeking to include staking in their funds. The SEC is due to issue decisions in October on similar requests for staking submitted by Cboe and the NYSE. It has an April deadline to weigh in on ETHA, although Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote in an X post Thursday that he doubted "it will take that long for a potential approval." "We think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25," Seyffart also wrote. Staking is not “done”. There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25) https://t.co/QWn9L2DVPA — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 17, 2025 The feature has been controversial, with proponents saying it would increase returns while critics raise concerns about security vulnerabilities and market manipulation. Prospectuses for ETHA and the other eight Ethereum funds currently trading indicated that the products would not include staking, but the 19b-4 filing proposes deletes that passage and proposes new language allowing for it. "In consideration for any staking activity in which the Trust may engage, the Trust would receive all or a portion of the staking rewards generated by the staking provider, which may be treated as income to the Trust," the new language states. BlackRock's Ethereum fund has been the most successful in this category, generating more than $7 billion in net inflows, more than double the total of any other, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. It was recently trading at just below $26, up nearly 1% as of the close of trading Thursday. Ethereum ETFs have been surging in recent weeks, adding more than $2.2 billion in net investments over a nine-day streak. On Wednesday, they hit a record daily high with $726.6 million in inflows, including nearly $500 million from ETHA alone.

Title: Talen Energy Expands and Enhances Portfolio with Best-in-Class CCGT Acquisitions in PJM

July 17, 2025 16:01 ET | Source: Talen Energy Corporation Talen Energy Corporation Houston, TX Houston, TX HOUSTON, July 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talen Energy Corporation (“Talen,” “we,” or “our”) (NASDAQ: TLN), a leading independent power producer, announced it has signed definitive agreements to acquire Caithness Energy’s Moxie Freedom Energy Center (“Moxie”) in Pennsylvania and Caithness Energy and BlackRock’s Guernsey Power Station (“Guernsey”) in Ohio, both combined-cycle gas-fired plants located within the PJM power market. The net acquisition price is $3.5 billion after adjusting for estimated tax benefits, or approximately $3.8 billion gross. The net purchase price reflects an attractive acquisition multiple of 6.7x 2026 EV/EBITDA for two of the most efficient natural gas plants in PJM, at a material discount to current new-build CCGT costs. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026, and over 50% through 2029. “This acquisition enhances Talen’s fleet by selectively adding modern, highly efficient baseload H-class CCGTs in Talen’s key markets, where we are an innovator in data center contracting,” said Mac McFarland, Talen President and Chief Executive Officer. “The transaction is immediately and highly accretive, maintains our balance sheet discipline, and adds more than the equivalent of another Susquehanna nuclear plant to our platform, further enabling large load service.” “Caithness has built an extensive portfolio of leading-edge power generation facilities to support our valued customers,” said James D. Bishop, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Caithness Energy. “We are proud of what we have accomplished and this sale to Talen positions the assets for continued success under a strong and successful management team.” ⸻ Key Strategic and Acquisition Highlights Additional Transaction DetailsTalen expects to issue approximately $3.8 billion in new debt to fund the acquisitions and refinance target debt, using both secured and unsecured instruments.

Ethereum rallies 8%, with institutional buys boosting momentum. Could ETH mirror its 2017 breakout to $6,200? Ethereum was setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. With the dwindling supply of ETH on CEXs at 13.4% lower than that of Bitcoin, a rally could be imminent. Can institutions make this happen? Ethereum [ETH] was trading at $3,435 at the time of writing, with the altcoin up about 8% in the last 24 hours. The daily trading volume was about $52M at the time of writing, about $20M short of what Bitcoin [BTC] had. As the altcoin continues to rally, analysts are betting on it to repeat previous successes. Can Ethereum do it? Analyst Mister Crypto on X, formerly Twitter, predicted that a rally for ETH was coming. The prediction came from the analysis that showed Ethereum could repeat its 2017 pattern. Mister Crypto’s prediction suggested that ETH could surpass $6,200, which would coincide with the high of $385 in 2017. His tweet read; “ETH is setting up just like it did in the 2017 cycle. If history repeats, a massive rally is imminent here!” Looking at the current price action, the chart confirms the potential outlook. Price had consolidated since mid-June to mid-July but had swept liquidity on both sides with false breakouts. Meanwhile, the volume bars were increasing as ETH pumped higher. Source: TradingView Ethereum’s continued price rise is boosting confidence that it could mirror its 2017 breakout. Analysts and institutions are closely watching the altcoin, with deeper research revealing they’re actively contributing to the rally’s momentum. BlackRock has added 159,101 ETH worth $499 million, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to 2.021 million ETH, valued at approximately $7 billion. This sizable accumulation places BlackRock firmly on the radar of Ethereum’s potential rally. Source: Whale Insider/X Still, Trump’s World Liberty Finance (WLFi) joined this purchase trail. While backing this potential surge, Ted Pillows reported that WLFi bought $4.99M worth of ETH. Ted Pillows also backed the bullishness, saying; “This is the worst time to be bearish on Ethereum.” WLFi added another batch of ETH, bringing its total purchases for the day to $10 million. Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming acquired 10,850 ETH, pushing its total Ethereum holdings to $1.03 billion. Combined, these moves raised the total ETH held in strategic reserves to 1.6 million ETH. This buying spree coincided with signs of a looming Ethereum supply crunch. According to Glassnode, ETH’s supply on exchanges dropped to 13.4%, compared to Bitcoin’s 14.5%, indicating stronger demand for Ethereum. If this trend continues, Ethereum could be on track to mirror its explosive 2017 rally. Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s shrinking supply is partly due to its growing staking market cap, which continues to climb. This trend may accelerate as banks increasingly choose Ethereum as the foundation for deploying their stablecoins, boosting demand even further.

Title: Lucid (LCID) shares surged +50%, so why did it announce a major reverse stock split?
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/07/17/lucid-lcid-shares-surged-50-reverse-stock-split/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T19:52:15Z
Full Content:
Lucid Motors’ (LCID) shares soared over 50% after the company secured a multi-hundred-million dollar investment from Uber to deploy robotaxis. So, why did Lucid just announce plans for a reverse stock split? Lucid and Uber announced a new alliance on Thursday to deploy 20,000 electric robotaxis over the next six years. The new robotaxi service, set to launch next year, will combine Lucid’s advanced software-defined EV platform with Nuro’s Level 4 self-driving tech. As part of the new alliance, Uber plans to make “multi-hundred-million-dollar investments” in Lucid and Nuro. The first autonomous prototype is already in operation on a closed track at Nuro’s facility in Las Vegas. Lucid’s interim CEO, Marc Winterhoff, said, “This investment from Uber further validates Lucid’s fully redundant zonal architecture and highly capable platform as ideal for autonomous vehicles.” Winteroff claimed that the new alliance “is the start of our path to extend our innovation and technology leadership into this multi-trillion-dollar market.” The Lucid Gravity boasts an impressive EPA-estimated range of 450 miles. Its electric sedan, the Lucid Air, just broke a Guinness World Record after traveling 749 miles (1,205 km) on a single charge. Lucid’s partnership with Uber sent share prices surging over 50% during trading hours on Thursday. In a separate filing with the SEC today, Lucid announced plans to initiate a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. The split won’t affect shareholder ownership, except in cases where fractional shares are created. In that case, shareholders will receive a cash payment. Lucid said it believes the reverse stock split “will allow the company’s common stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors and other market participants.” During an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Winterhoff explained that a portion of the $300 million investment from Uber will be used to develop the self-driving tech with Nuro. Winterhoff added that Lucid’s surging share price was “a vote of confidence.” According to Winterhoff, the reverse stock split is not due to Lucid’s fear of being delisted, but rather to attract larger investors. It was also more of a “technical” strategy to reduce volatility and help Lucid participate in the broader stock market. Many institutional investors avoid stocks priced below $5 due to the higher risk and price swings. The proposed stock split still requires shareholder approval, which will be voted on at an upcoming special stockholders’ meeting. After that, Lucid’s Board of Directors will determine whether it’s still in the best interest of the company and its stockholders to proceed. Lucid’s stock rose over 36% on Thursday, closing at $3.12 per share. Although shares of LCID are up just slightly (+2%), they are now up year-to-date. However, they are still down 18% over the past year and nearly 95% from their all-time high of over $58 a share in February 2021. Last week, after meeting with Lucid’s CFO, Taoufiq Boussaid, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg set a target share price of $5.00, which was subsequently raised to $7.00 following the announcement of the Uber partnership. Legg wrote a note to investors, “After meeting with LCID’s CFO Taoufiq Boussaid on Tuesday and reviewing 2Q production and deliveries, we remain confident in the company’s path to scale.” Lucid delivered a record 3,309 vehicles in Q2, its seventh straight quarter with higher deliveries. The company aims to produce 20,000 vehicles this year, more than double the roughly 9,000 it made in 2024. After ending the first quarter with $5.76 billion in liquidity, Lucid said that it has sufficient funding to last until the second half of 2026, when it plans to launch its more affordable midsize EV platform. The first two models will be a midsize SUV and sedan, starting at about $50,000. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: BlackRock moves to add staking to Ethereum ETF amid surge in inflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-moves-to-add-staking-to-ethereum-etf-amid-surge-in-inflows/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T19:45:03Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has filed to incorporate staking into its iShares Ethereum Trust (ticker: ETHA), the largest Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by assets under management. The move, disclosed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, follows growing institutional interest in Ethereum staking products and comes amid record-breaking net inflows into ETH ETFs. The filing was submitted by Nasdaq under SEC Rule 19b-4, which national securities exchanges follow to propose new fund structures. BlackRock is the latest asset manager to pursue staking capabilities for its Ethereum fund, joining a competitive field that includes Grayscale, 21Shares, and others with similar proposals already in the pipeline. BlackRock’s filing outlines that the trust may stake “all or a portion” of its ETH holdings through one or more trusted staking providers. The proposal specifies that the ether held by the trust will not be pooled with other entities, nor will the trust assume risk on behalf of others from slashing or network forks. Coinbase, currently acting as custodian and prime execution agent for ETHA, is expected to serve as the fund’s staking partner. The filing comes at a moment of surging interest in Ethereum investment products. On Wednesday, ETH ETFs recorded their highest single-day net inflow since launch, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA accounting for $499 million of that sum. So far in July, ETH ETFs have attracted over $2.27 billion in net inflows, marking the strongest monthly inflow to date, according to data from SoSoValue. ETHA was approved in July 2024, as part of a group of spot Ethereum ETFs greenlit by the SEC shortly after it approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. ETHA currently holds over $7.9 billion in assets, underscoring BlackRock’s leadership position in Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, has previously signaled that staking would be the “next phase” for crypto ETFs. Thursday’s filing appears to make that vision concrete, at a time when regulatory momentum and investor interest are aligning. BlackRock’s move comes shortly after the SEC approved the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, the first US-based staking ETF, earlier this month. That product was approved under the more stringent Securities Exchange Act of 1940. In contrast, BlackRock’s ETHA staking proposal falls under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, under which no staking ETF has yet been approved. However, SEC officials have indicated growing openness to staking ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X (formerly Twitter) that “staking is not done,” predicting that approval for Ethereum staking ETFs may arrive as early as Q4 2025. While BlackRock’s latest filing may not receive a final decision until around April 2026, the broader outlook for staking products appears favorable. As Ethereum’s price hovers near $3,399—still below its 2021 all-time high of $4,878—the prospect of yield-generating, regulated staking products could further fuel institutional adoption. With competitors also eyeing staking ETFs for assets like Cronos, Tron, and Injective, BlackRock’s move signals an increasingly diverse crypto ETF landscape taking shape.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ Those cuts happened Thursday (July 17), Reuters reported, citing two sources. A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the cuts in a statement to PYMNTS. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the statement said. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” The company also pointed out that it is continuing to hire in other areas, including within AWS. While the Reuters report notes that the layoffs came one month after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence AI would lead to job cuts, the company insisted to PYMNTS that these cuts were not related to AI, but rather the results of a review on areas that could be streamlined. Several workers told Reuters they had gotten emails on Thursday morning that notified them they had been let go and their computers were being deactivated. Reuters said it could not determine the full scope of the layoffs but added at least one group, known as “specialists,” was impacted. These employees work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. The report noted that the cuts put Amazon in the company of a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike to announce job cuts this year. Jassy on June 17 had sent a message to employees telling them that workers who have learned to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. He added that the company’s corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company embraces AI, which he described as the most transformative technology to come along since the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Other executives have offered starker warnings, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who told the Aspen Ideas Festival that “artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, as seen in the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” shows that 54% of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The research also found that 38% were worried the technology could eventually bring about the elimination of their specific jobs.

Amazon.com Inc. has begun cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as the tech giant recalibrates its priorities in the face of growing artificial intelligence-related expenses, as per a report. According to a statement provided to Bloomberg by company spokesperson Brad Glasser on Thursday, the layoffs are affecting several teams within AWS, the world's largest cloud services provider. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” Glasser said via email, as per the news outlet. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition.” The job cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations while continuing to invest in innovation. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Glasser added, as per the news publication. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had signaled this direction earlier. In June, he stated that the company expects a reduction in its workforce over the coming years as it leverages artificial intelligence to automate a growing number of internal tasks. Amazon is the latest among major tech companies to trim headcount in response to the shifting cost dynamics of AI development and deployment, underscoring the complex tradeoffs between automation, innovation, and human capital. As of the end of March, Amazon reportedly was the second-largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with a total workforce of 1.56 million. While the majority are warehouse employees handling packing and shipping, over 350,000 hold corporate positions. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp. — another tech giant heavily investing in AI — initiated a new round of layoffs affecting approximately 9,000 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction this year.

Title: Amazon slashing hundreds of jobs at AWS cloud unit — month after CEO says AI will spur layoffs: report

Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday, two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” AWS sales rose 17% in the first quarter to $29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23% to $11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers.

Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp., which has also been spending lavishly on AI, began job cuts that will impact about 9,000 workers, its second major wave of layoffs this year. Reuters, citing people familiar with the situation, earlier reported that the Amazon job cuts will affect hundreds of people. The company declined to say how many positions are being eliminated. Amazon is the largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most of those people work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but more than 350,000 of them worked in corporate jobs.

Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut. Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic. Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment. The company has yet to respond to a request about what makes an employee eligible. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Title: Shark Tank star Daniel Lubetzky says college is not the ‘end all, be all’—he tells Gen Z to learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic instead

Time Published: 2025-07-17T16:01:29Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z is having a career nightmare. Business leaders have all but predicted a demise of entry-level, white-collar work. Already, many young people are being left with mounds of student loan debt and a ritzy qualification but no job to their name. Luckily, according to billionaire Daniel Lubetzky, there remains plenty of opportunity for Gen Z—if they look in the right places. “For those people that have great ideas or great opportunities and don’t want to go to college, I don’t think college is an end all, be all or required thing,” Lubetzky the newest judge on Shark Tank, tells Fortune. Despite making a name for himself in entrepreneurship by selling his snack company KIND to Mars in 2020 for $5 billion, Lubetzky says young people could make a killing going down the skilled trade route. “Vocational training and learning how to be a carpenter or a mechanic or any of those jobs is a huge field with huge opportunities that pays really, really well,” he adds. Lubetzky is on the money: While jobs like software engineer or graphic designer may be harder to come by in the coming years thanks to AI job replacements, fields in the skilled trade space are thriving in part off an increased demand for data centers. Plus, with often only an apprenticeship or on-the-job training required, it could be an accessible way for professionals to transition their careers and gain six-figure salaries. While the skilled trade industry isn’t foolproof—and is still plagued with seasonality and safety hazards—job openings remain high. The U.S. construction industry alone had 245,000 job openings in May 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The manufacturing sector had over 414,000 jobs. While Gen Z may have grown up with aspirations to attend an Ivy League and then land a top Silicon Valley job, that reality may have been a disservice to young people—and many have felt this the hard way. So far this year, over 80,000 tech workers have experienced layoffs. To rub salt in the wound, leaders such as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have been transparent that AI is making it easier than ever to reduce corporate ranks. “We’ve made a mistake in society in not sufficiently celebrating builders, not just builders of schools and of KIND bars, but builders of physical bridges and builders of gears,” Lubetzky says. “We in society need to start celebrating those professionals more.” The 56-year-old adds that universities have “failed us” over the last 20 to 30 years by neglecting to teach young people how to be critical thinkers and listeners—or in his words, a “builder’s mindset,” meaning prioritizing curiosity, creativity, compassion and courage. “Having a builder’s mindset is so essential to our society and under curiosity fits critical thinking, critical listening, all of those things,” Lubetzky stresses. The skilled trade industry has the potential to be a safe haven from AI’s revolution on white-collar work. In fact, many young people have already seen the writing on the wall, with enrollment at trade-focused institutions increasing almost 20% since the spring of 2020, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. However, the career path may not be as lucrative as some promise it to be. Trade roles are among the worst entry-level U.S. jobs, according to a new WalletHub study. Welders, automotive mechanics, boilermakers bottomed out on the list, thanks in part to their lack of growth potential and high job hazard. Trade industries also have high unemployment levels due to their seasonal nature, as well as reportedly lower levels of happiness. But either way, Lubetzky says trying something out and deciding you don’t like it—or failing—can be critical to advancing through your career. “Sometimes a failure is more valuable than a success,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Business A logo for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France on Jun 12, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Benoit Tessier) SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday (Jul 17), two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people.

"Wherever possible, we’ve worked hard to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are impacted," it added. AWS sales rose 17 per cent in the first quarter to US$29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23 per cent to US$11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable".

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Rigetti Computing’s stock jumped 30% on July 16 after reaching 99.5% gate fidelity on its 36-qubit modular system—halving error rates compared to its earlier 84-qubit chip. This achievement confirms their chiplet-based architecture as a scalable option for practical quantum computing. Even though RGTI stock has already seen an impressive 1,300% increase over the past twelve months, the question persists: what elements could propel the stock to another tenfold increase? That being said, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. Additionally, see – RCAT Stock To $25? NVIDIA provides the most relevant comparison for QBTS’s potential growth path. From 2016 to 2024, NVIDIA stock soared from about $8 to over $130 (adjusted for stock splits), representing a 16x increase. This growth occurred as NVIDIA transformed from a gaming graphics company to a fundamental part of AI infrastructure. Likewise, D-Wave may benefit from the growing quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s creation of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to beyond $400 in 2020-2021, demonstrating how revolutionary applications can result in explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly revolutionize industries once they achieve commercial success. Rigetti stands as a high-risk, high-reward prospect at the commercial inflection point of quantum computing. Their breakthrough in modular architecture, in tandem with manufacturing partnerships and government endorsement, opens up various avenues for 10x growth. Success is contingent on executing the scaling strategy, proving a commercial quantum advantage, and achieving revenue growth to validate their substantial current valuation. For those willing to take risks, Rigetti offers exposure to potentially transformative technology with distinct competitive benefits at a pivotal market transition. While considerable risks exist, the potential for transformative influence across varied industries justifies a premium valuation for investors with the right risk tolerance and long-term investment outlook. We emphasize the significant risks associated with this investment; therefore, investors should carefully assess these risks or explore professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio featuring 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated higher returns with lesser risk compared to the benchmark index, experiencing reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Microsoft is on track to become the second $4 trillion company by market cap, following NVIDIA — and mass layoffs

Microsoft's share price rose over 19% this year so far, vastly outperforming the overall market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA might have clinched the world-first $4 trillion crown, but Microsoft could be hot on its heels. As stock performance goes, Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella has been a shining star, for better or worse. Microsoft's market capitalization as of writing is $3.758 trillion, putting it just shy of NVIDIA's $4.179 trillion. Microsoft has comfortably began to outpace Apple, at $3.1 trillion, as investors get nervous about Apple's position (or lack thereof) in a world increasingly dominated by AI. Indeed, NVIDIA and Microsoft's market position in recent times has been driven by cloud services. NVIDIA providing the hardware, and Microsoft providing the software, in essence. NVIDIA's server technology is powering the global artificial intelligence goldrush. Microsoft's Azure data center operations, in combination with its OpenAI partnership, is powering the back end for hundreds of thousands of Azure customer — and millions of their customers by extension. Indeed, Apple itself is reportedly leveraging Azure and OpenAI's models to power some of its platform features, showing the virtue of Satya Nadella's big cloud investment strategy. Microsoft's share price has risen by over 15% this year as of writing, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by a comfortable amount. Microsoft's stock has become a hot ticket in recent years owing to big dividend payouts and stock buyback programs. Those who invested back at the start of the cloud goldrush have made mountains of profits with Microsoft stock, and that looks set to continue as cloud underpins practically every new technological leap. Without cloud, there's no AI, there's no Netflix, no Amazon, no web services, apps, online games, and so on — and its this that has driven Microsoft to market capitalization dominance in recent years. Microsoft has also invested heavily in subscription-based services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure platforms, and even Xbox Game Pass — giving it reliable and steady revenue that outperforms retail trends and provides resilience against consumer confidence, to a degree. But there's still risk factors involved. Some analysts regard Microsoft stock as overly expensive right now, which is probably partially why Microsoft has had so many layoffs this past year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Boosting margins and increasing profits-per-employee is a short-term way to grow into its valuation, but as I wrote last week, the chilling effect its layoffs has on employee morale and product quality could do long-term harm. Windows, Xbox, Surface, and other consumer-facing Microsoft products have stagnated in some ways, some more than others — leaving the diversification of Microsoft's business vulnerable. One has to wonder just how much of Microsoft's current strategy revolves around boosting the stock price, given exec pay packets are often tied to stock, rather than actually providing high-quality products. You'd think the stock price would go hand in hand with high-quality products, but many of Microsoft's existing offerings, particularly in the consumer segment, leave a lot to be desired. Its enviable second place position in cloud isn't guaranteed either, as Google and others rapidly invest in catching up. Google also doesn't need to rely on OpenAI for its AI models either, potentially giving it an advantage when it comes to innovating new products. There's also been jitters that agentic AI, that is, AI that can basically fully replace humans, might paradoxically impact some of Microsoft's enterprise software businesses. Microsoft has shown itself to be adaptable and versatile when navigating new technological paradigms, but this rapid shifting of priorities has often been viewed as presenting inconsistent and unreliable to consumers. Microsoft's business to business operations remain its core strength, regardless, and it's likely this fact that will drive its market capitalization above $4 trillion in the coming weeks or months ahead. But things can change rapidly in tech, even for big players like Microsoft. Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Title: A second-generation molecular clamp stabilised bivalent candidate vaccine for protection against diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312

Full Content:
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two medically important causes of respiratory tract infections and diseases. After more than five decades of research and development, vaccines have recently been approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, vaccines for hMPV remain in early-stage development. Here we describe the design and characterisation as well as pre-clinical development of a bivalent vaccine, VXB-241, comprised of the recombinantly expressed viral fusion proteins from both RSV and hMPV, stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the second-generation molecular clamp (MC2S) and key pre-fusion stabilizing mutations. Each of the two antigens were produced at high yield in a mammalian expression system and purified by an affinity capture resin specific to MC2S. Each antigen was demonstrated to adopt the pre-fusion conformation, which was stable for at least twelve months in liquid formulation at 2–8°C. Head-to-head evaluation in mouse immunogenicity studies showed that the VXB-241 candidate vaccine induced a neutralising immune response that was superior or equivalent to the pre-fusion stabilised comparator antigens for either RSV or hMPV, including the RSVPreF3 antigen of the licensed RSV vaccine, Arexvy (GSK). The results presented here have supported progression of VXB-241 into a Phase 1 clinical trial which commenced enrolment in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06556147). A second-generation molecular clamp was used to help lock viral glycoproteins in a stabilised native prefusion conformation to elicit highly protective immunity and to enable consistent manufacture of highly stable, ready-to-use, fully liquid vaccines. The first- and second-generation molecular clamp platforms were previously validated in two successful Phase 1 clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (NCT04495933 and NCT05775887). This work is the first presentation of the pre-clinical development of a multi-pathogen vaccine, VXB-241 targeting both RSV and hMPV. The two antigens (VXB-213 and VXB-221) were shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 2–8°C and are able to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV in mouse immunogenicity study. VXB-241 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06556147). Citation: Young A, Kolekar S, Mendoza CA, Jaberolansar N, Modhiran N, Webb T, et al.

RSV was discovered in 1956 and causes infections at all ages and is a major cause of severe illness, especially for infants and older adults. There are 2 major antigenic subtypes of human RSV (A and B). By 2 years of age, virtually all children will have been infected with RSV. RSV is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, the epidemiology of RSV shows high incidence of RSV hospitalisation among older patients as well as high risk for severe disease in immunocompromised adults [1]. Long-term care facility residents are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks and serious illness [2]. RSV burden of severe disease may be comparable to influenza [1]. Since the discovery of hMPV in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. Through genetic analysis hMPV has been characterised into 2 groups A and B which are further divided into 4 sub-lineages [3]. hMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. hMPV is associated with acute lower respiratory infections and can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Overall, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are like those in RSV infection [4]. Although nearly all populations will experience primary hMPV infection by age 5, hMPV re-infection occurs throughout adult life. Rates of hospitalisation of children for hMPV infection are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Pre-existing conditions, particularly asthma, play a role in disease severity and hospitalisation [5]. It has been documented that both RSV and hMPV have a high incidence rate and burden of illness, especially amongst susceptible populations including newborns, young children under 5 years of age, older adults, elderly and immunocompromised host. In children under five years of age, RSV infections were estimated to cause per year 33 million acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and to be associated to 3.6 million hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths worldwide [6]. Within the paediatric population globally in 2018, hMPV infection was estimated to be the cause per year of 11 million ALRI cases, 502,000 hospitalisations and 11,300 deaths [7]. In older adults over the age of 60, RSV infection is estimated to account for 5.2 million ALRIs, 470,000 hospitalisations and 33,000 deaths in high-income countries alone [8]. Within the older adult population, the burden of disease caused by hMPV has been less intensely studied, however there is an increased availability and implementation of molecular assays in clinical practice to analyse the virus causing lower respiratory tract disease [9]. Recent studies, conducted in the US and several countries worldwide, have shown that RSV and hMPV are similarly related to acute respiratory diseases, with similar reported percentage of virus detection, hospitalisations and deaths in susceptible populations [10]. After more than 5 decades of research and development [11,12], three vaccines have recently been approved in Europe, the USA and elsewhere for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults: two subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13] and Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14], and a mRNA vaccine, MRESVIA (Moderna) [15]. Abrysvo has also received approval for vaccination during pregnancy for the protection of infants against RSV throughout the first six months following birth [16]. Each vaccine has demonstrated high levels of protective efficacy and favourable safety in their respective target populations [13–16]. The transformational discovery at the heart of these advances has been the recognition that during the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, glycoprotein F transitions irreversibly from a pre-fusion (RSV preF) to a post-fusion (RSV postF) conformation. RSV preF is an unstable conformation that is able to elicit strong neutralising antibody (nAb) activity while the conformationally more stable RSV postF elicits poor nAb activity [17,18]. While there are no vaccines currently available for hMPV, a bivalent mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna targeting hMPV and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) has demonstrated potential to boost neutralisation responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial [19]. Moderna is currently conducting further clinical trials of a bivalent mRNA vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV. Icosavax, now part of AstraZeneca, is also developing a bivalent RSV-hMPV vaccine (IVX-A12), based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which has been demonstrated to boost neutralsing antibody titres against both RSV and hMPV by 3–5 fold [20]. As with RSV, the hMPV preF has been demonstrated to elicit a higher neutralising immune response than hMPV postF [21–24], however there are also some differences between the two viruses. For RSV most neutralising immune responses are specific to RSV preF [17,18], however for hMPV neutralising immune responses overlap between hMPV preF and postF [25–27], with some neutralising antibodies (nAbs) recognising epitopes on the internal trimer interface [25,28]. While the newly approved RSV vaccines have great potential to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce the burden on hospitals during peak RSV seasons, equitable distribution of ready-to-use vaccine formulations remains a significant barrier to access these important vaccines, especially within LMICs. Both approved subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and MRESVIA, like other mRNA vaccines, is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration, cannot be refrozen and must be discarded if not used within 24 hours of thawing [14]. Such requirements complicate real world use. Costly manufacturing and distribution requirements also likely add to the price per dose for these vaccines, impacting global supply and equitable access. A further challenge exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) as vaccination compliance becomes more challenging. The prospect of adding further vaccines to cover and protect against high burden respiratory diseases caused by other viruses such as hMPV and PIV into the current schedule will increase compliance challenges. To address this medical need, multivalent vaccines will be of increased importance and will require developing stable antigens that can be combined in one vaccine. In this work, we describe the development and pre-clinical evaluation of a bivalent candidate vaccine (VXB-241) to provide protection against RSV and hMPV ALRIs. VXB-241 is composed of two antigens: RSV preF (VXB-213) and hMPV preF (VXB-221). The two antigens are stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the proprietary second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp (MC2S) platform, which enables trimerisation and purification, and key pre-fusion stabilising mutations. The two candidate vaccine antigens show high production yield, liquid stability and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway with the key objective being the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). Following the finding in late 2020 that the immune response induced by a first-generation molecular clamp (MC)-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sclamp, interfered with some HIV diagnostic tests [29], the original MC platform was re-engineered to avoid the use of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41. A panel of candidate heptad repeat sequences was screened to identify those that form highly stable 6HB structures. Subsequent rounds of optimisation and testing led to the identification of molecular clamp 2 (MC2); details available WO2023187743. As HIV-1 gp41 derived sequences are not included in MC2, cross-reactivity to HIV diagnostics was not anticipated. However, given the similarities in quaternary structure, to rule this out an ELISA was conducted using two different reference serum samples readily available for HIV diagnostic testing. Testing via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both NIBSC HIV reference serum and BioRad Geenius HIV+ control serum revealed reactivity to MC but no detectable reactivity to MC2 (S1 Fig). Both MC and MC2 were compared, and tested with three different viral antigens that had been validated on the first-generation platform (antigen from SARS-CoV-2 [29], Nipah virus [30], influenza A virus [31]), as well as an early iteration of the RSV preF antigen that was in development. For the four antigens; comparable antigen homogeneity and oligomeric characteristics were conferred by MC and MC2, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (S2 Fig). Immunogenicity in mice was also compared, with sera from mice vaccinated with MC2 and MC2S stabilised antigens shown to elicit equivalent or superior levels of neutralising immune responses compared to MC (S3 Fig). The second-generation clamp was further developed to incorporate additional N-linked glycosylation sites to dampen immunogenicity, referred to as Molecular Clamp 2 Silenced (MC2S). RSV preF incorporating MC2S was compared to MC and MC2, with antigen homogeneity again shown to be comparable and superior neutralising immune responses elicited in mice compared to MC (S2 and S3 Figs). The effect of silencing was demonstrated by comparing the immune response in mice after vaccination with RSV F antigen containing either MC, MC2 or MC2S. The relative percentage of elicited IgG binding to MC2S was reduced by >2-fold from a geometric mean of 34.3% for MC2 to 15.8% for MC2S (S4 Fig). To further determine whether there was any cross-reactivity to HIV gp41, sera from mouse vaccinated with either MC or MC2 stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analysed by ELISA against HIV gp41. The MC2 stabilised spike elicited approximately 38-fold lower cross-reactivity compared to MC, essentially at, or near the LoD of the assay (S5 Fig). The RSV and hMPV candidate vaccine antigens including MC2S were generated and analysed side by side with well characterised recombinant protein controls for comparison. Briefly, there were two categories of controls, controls that were classed as non-stabilised soluble controls (RSV Fsol and hMPV Fsol), and controls that were preF stabilised benchmark comparators with a foldon trimerisation domain (RSV DsCav1 [32], hMPV DsCavEs2 [21] and hMPV v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23]). From the new candidate vaccine antigens containing MC2S, one antigen has been selected for RSV, RSV preF, called VXB-213 and another for hMPV, hMPV preF, called VXB-221. VXB-213 was engineered to include the optimal disulfide bridge linkages and furin cleavage site deletion identified by McLellan et al., [32] and Joyce et al., [33], whereas VXB-221 included an unmodified TMPRSS2 cleavage site, a proline substitution and a single disulfide bridge [21,34]. The nomenclature with brief description of each antigen is summarised in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312.t001 At a research laboratory scale for antigen discovery purposes, the recombinant antigens were expressed as secretable proteins in mammalian suspension culture (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ExpiCHO-S, Thermofisher) and purified from clarified supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using either a ligand-resin with affinity for MC2S (AVI-8740) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral ectodomain. They were buffer exchanged into PBS and characterised by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex Increase 10 300 GL (Cytiva) SEC column (Fig 1). Both the RSV and hMPV antigen panels showed similar trends for their oligomerisation profiles, with the non-stabilised Fsol proteins producing the greatest proportion of aggregate (RSV Fsol, 94% aggregate, 0% trimer; hMPV Fsol, 25% aggregate, 19% trimer, 56% monomer), the MC2S-incorporating antigens showing high degrees of trimer homogeneity (>89% trimer for both VXB-213 and VXB-221) with the comparator antigens being intermediate to these two (RSV DSCav1, 69% trimer; hMPV DSCavEs2, 54% trimer). hMPV DsCavEs2 produced two overlapping peaks within the trimeric fractions, suggesting that the trimer may adopt distinct conformational or oligomeric states. This observation differs from the results reported by Hsieh et al., [22], where hMPV DSCavEs2 was expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells, in the presence of co-transfected Furin and an additional SEC purification step. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that RSV DSCav1 produced here in expiCHO-S (Thermofisher), may be conformationally different to that produced by McLellan et al., in HEK293K cells [32].

For VXB-213 (Vicebio RSV preF) and the DsCav1 comparator, sub-nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) for all three mAbs were observed (Fig 1G). AM14 binds a preF, quaternary epitope and its binding to vaccine antigens has been correlated with protective immunity [38]. This mAb showed poor reactivity to the non-stabilised Fsol antigen, while binding VXB-213 with 8 picomolar KD; a 6-fold higher avidity relative to DsCav1. For the hMPV antigens, a broader panel of mAbs targeting diverse epitopes across the topology of preF was tested against the antigen series in an indirect ELISA format (Fig 1H). VXB-221 (Vicebio hMPV preF) was shown to be recognised with sub-nanomolar binding to five of the six mAbs tested. Only DS7 [39], which binds to the post-fusion conformation or a pre/post intermediate, showed low affinity for VXB-221. Neutralising antibodies with moderate or strong pre-fusion preference (MPV467, MPV-487 and MPE8) [37,40], showed similar sub-nanomolar affinities for VXB-221 and comparator antigens DSCavEs2 and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, but poor reactivity for hMPV Fsol. Neutralising antibodies known to recognise the internal trimer interface (MPV-458 and M8C10) [25,40], were able to bind with sub-nanomolar affinity to MPV-Fsol, DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 but showed poor affinity for v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, which contains an interprotomer disulphide bridge and has been optimised to adopt a closed, pre-fusion conformation [23]. Further analysis of the antigens by SDS-PAGE showed that the VXB-213 and VXB-221 were both highly pure and homogenous bands of predicted size for the non-cleaved products (S6 Fig). RSV Fsol and DsCav1 controls both showed a major band at the appropriate size for the furin cleaved product. hMPV Fsol showed a major band consistent with the non-cleaved product, DsCavEs2 also showed the presence of two major bands consistent with partial furin cleavage. All four controls exhibited some smearing that could be due to either impurities or proteolytic degradation. The ability of each antigen to deplete neutralising antibodies from a pooled human plasma sample was compared either by directly pre-incubating plasma with antigens in solution or with immobilised antigens coupled to CNBR Activated Sepharose (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous reports [17,18], RSV Fsol performed poorly at removing neutralising antibodies from human plasma, whereas both DSCav1 and VXB-213, were highly efficient at depleting neutralising antibodies (S7A Fig). DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 were also both able to efficiently deplete hMPV neutralising antibodies, although hMPV Fsol was not tested (S7B Fig). BALB/c mice were immunised with 2 µg of the recombinant antigens by intramuscular injection (IM) in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). To ensure RSV and hMPV Fsol antigens were fully in the post-fusion state they were first heated to 70°C for 2 hrs. At completion, analysis of mouse sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the immunisations had been effective in inducing IgG against each respective antigen. The bivalent candidate vaccine, VXB-241 (a combination of VXB-213 and VXB-221), elicited a response to both the RSV preF and hMPV preF antigens (Fig 2A). Each antigen also elicited a response to the trimer stabilising domain that was detectable via ELISA with a non-homologous antigen (Nipah F) stabilised with either foldon or MC2S. By comparing EC50 values for total antigen-specific IgG and tag-specific IgG for each mouse we were able to estimate the proportion of tag-specific response. This response was considered undesirable as it will not contribute to protection. For VXB-213 and VXB-221 the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S was found to be 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, while with the bivalent VXB-241 the relative response to MC2S was found to be 4.7% (Fig 2B). In comparison, for the RSV F DSCav1 the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was found to be 19.9%. For the hMPV F DSCavEs2 comparator, which also contains foldon, the geometric mean (GM) of the relative response to foldon was 3.1%. This response was somewhat variable with very low titres for 5 individual mice and relatively high titres for the remaining 3 mice.

This analysis demonstrates that VXB-213, at a dose of 2 µg delivered twice, 3 weeks apart, induces a neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 489; 95%CI = 222–1208). The response to VXB-213 is equivalent to comparator antigen RSV F DSCav1 (GM = 475; 95%CI = 255–946), and approximately 10-fold higher to heat-treated RSV Fsol (GM = 59; 95%CI = 32–125). The analysis of neutralisation against hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) demonstrates that VXB-221 induces a neutralising immune response to hMPV (GM = 1384; 95%CI = 1094–1762). The neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 was 2.5-fold higher than comparator antigen hMPV F DSCavEs2 (GM = 558; 95%CI = 336–971) and approximately 5.5-fold higher to heat-treated hMPV Fsol (GM = 252; 95%CI = 99–778). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 to comparator hMPV F DSCavEs2 showed a highly significant difference (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.0003). The combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 (the selected RSV preF and hMPV preF) antigens mixed prior to injection in mouse, elicited a strong neutralising immune response against both RSV A2 (GM = 329; 95%CI = 171–687) and hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) (GM = 755; 95%CI = 543–1069). A larger scale 50L manufacturing scale production run was performed with the resulting antigens analysed and data compared. For this 50L scale production, stably transfected pools were generated for each antigen. High expression clonal cell lines for VXB-213 and VXB-221 were isolated from CHO K1 stable cell pools and a top clone was selected for production of two specific clonal cell banks. For each antigen an initial production batch was completed at 50L scale to generate material for use in the currently described mouse immunogenicity studies. Production of VXB-213 yielded 1.7 g/L and production of VXB-221 yielded 5.5g/L respectively compared to laboratory scale transient production using the ExpiCHO-S (Thermofisher). This corresponds to production level increases of 70- and 300-fold for VXB-213 and VXB-221, respectively. To assess antigen stability in a liquid formulation over time, a panel of assays was developed. This panel included monitoring for proteolytic degradation by Capillary Electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (CE-SDS), monitoring for the stability of the soluble trimer by Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and use of a capture ELISA based potency test for each antigen. For VXB-213 (RSV preF), the ELISA included the mAbs Motavizumab [41] to capture and AM14 [38] to probe and for VXB-221 (hMPV preF), DS7 [39] to capture and MPE8 [37] to probe. Stability assessment conducted over twelve months with VXB-213 and VXB-221, showed that both antigens retain >99% single product by CE-SDS, > 90% soluble trimer by SE-HPLC and no decrease in reactivity by Potency ELISA (S8 Fig). Material from the RSV preF (VXB-213) 50L batch was biochemically tested by SDS-PAGE alongside the current Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens. As these comparator antigens are distributed as a lyophilised powder, they were first reconstituted in PBS containing 0.05% PS80. Under reducing conditions, the VXB-213 and VXB-241 samples were highly pure with >95% product forming a single band at 60–70 kDa (S7 Fig). Both the Arexvy and Abrysvo antigens produced a major band between the 37 and 50 kDa markers with faint smearing of larger molecular weight products, and a secondary band slightly larger than 20 kDa. This appears to be consistent with near complete furin cleavage of the antigens. In addition to the above, the antigens manufactured at the 50L bioreactor scale were similarly tested for the induction of immunogenicity and neutralisation responses using BALB/c mice. This study involved two immunisations of either 0.5 µg or 3 µg of each antigen (RSVpreF3 from GSK’s RSV vaccine Arexvy, VXB-213, and VXB-221), or with either 1 µg or 6 µg of the combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 mixed prior mouse injection, called here VXB-241. Two doses were given, 3 weeks apart, all adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invitrogen). Three weeks after the second dose, serum was collected and assayed by ELISA to determine total IgG against each antigen, and the ‘tag-specific’ reactivity using an antigen containing either the MC2S domain or the foldon domain with a heterologous ectodomain (Fig 3A). For VXB-213, VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241, the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S for each group ranged between 3.7 and 11.2% (Fig 3B). In comparison, for the Arexvy RSVPreF3 antigen the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was around twice as high at 15.5 and 15.4%.

At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 both stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 5,272; 95%CI = 2,884–10,046 and geomean = 8,453; 95%CI = 4,966–14,894, respectively), which was approximately 6- and 10-fold higher relative to the dose-matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 817; 95%CI = 420–1,710). At the higher dose level of 3 µg of the RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 also stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 6,124; 95%CI = 4,375–8,690 and geomean = 7,534; 95%CI = 5,082–8,690, respectively), which was approximately 2- and 2.5-fold higher relative to the dose matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 2,958; 95%CI = 1,361–6,982). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-213 to the response elicited by the Arexvy antigen showed a significant difference at the 0.5 µg dose level (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.003) but not at the higher dose level of 3 µg (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.13). The equivalent analysis of neutralisation against hMPV preF (Strain CAN97–83) is shown in Fig 3D. At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of hMPV preF antigen, monovalent VXB-221 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (GM = 1,074; 95%CI = 818 - 1,426), however the neutralising immune response was approximately 5-fold lower for the bivalent VXB-241 (GM = 185; 95%CI = 98–380), potentially indicating some interference due to immunodominance of the RSV preF antigen. At the higher dose level of 3 µg of hMPV antigen, both monovalent VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (geomean = 721; 95%CI = 339 - 1,694 and geomean = 519; 95%CI = 235 - 1,288, respectively). Historically, broadly applicable platform technologies for vaccines have saved countless lives. Such platform technologies have included bacterial polysaccharide vaccines (Meningococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus) [42], chemical inactivation of viruses (polio, influenza, rabies, Hepatitis A) and viral attenuation (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Yellow Fever, Varicella) [43]. While successful, the application of these technologies to new targets often took upwards of 5- > 20 years. In recent years, a variety of platform technologies have been established that have significantly streamlined vaccine development and manufacturing. This is most clear in the mRNA vaccine revolution that has been brought forward in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. As there are still several challenges linked to the mRNA vaccines field (high reactogenicity, poor longevity, requirement for frozen storage) [44], having a broader variety of established vaccine platforms that are based on different approaches remains valuable. Here, we have demonstrated that vaccine antigens produced with the Molecular Clamp (MC) platform offer key advantages such as liquid stability and improved immune responses. The MC platform provides the versatility to target diverse viral pathogens. The MC platform is essentially a high stability trimerization domain, similar to previously utilised alternatives GCN4 and Foldon [45,46]. The broadly applicable potential of a first-generation Molecular Clamp based on the HIV-1 gp41 6HB domain was demonstrated in preclinical studies for several viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, and MERS coronavirus [30,31]. In 2020 a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine progressed through Phase 1 clinical trial, with demonstrated safety and good immunogenicity profiles, but was not progressed due to interference with some HIV diagnostic tests, generating false positives [29]. A re-engineered, non-HIV antigen based MC2S sequence, provides the same candidate vaccine attributes, but overcomes the hurdle that prevented progression of MC. The MC2S platform provides high production yield and purity with a universal purification system (AVI-8740 affinity resin), which facilitates rapid advancement through pre-clinical development. For two viral targets (RSV preF and hMPV preF) transient expression yields of 10 – 30 mg/L were achieved with purity above 95% by SDS-PAGE and approximately 90% homogenous trimer by SEC. This level of production comfortably accommodates pre-clinical testing, including in vitro assessment and animal immunisation studies. Furthermore, transition to 50L scale manufacture uses a comparable process regardless of antigen and was able to increase yields to >1 g/L. Production yields such as this with a consistent manufacturing process have the potential to dramatically reduce investment required to achieve commercial scale vaccine production. Following the approval of a first generation of RSV vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13], Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14,16], MRESVIA (Moderna) [15], a large unmet medical need remains with the combined burden of other severe respiratory tract infections amongst highly susceptible populations including newborns, children under 5 years of age, older adult elderly and the immunocompromised. Moreover, there are areas in which the currently approved RSV vaccines can be improved. The two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and the LNP/mRNA vaccine (MRESVIA) is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration [14]. All three current RSV vaccines must be discarded if not used within a defined short period of time. In comparison, our current data show that the MC2S incorporating RSV antigen VXB-213, as well as VXB221 (hMPV preF), are both stable in liquid form at 2–8 °C for > 12 months. This finding supports compatibility with prefilled syringes at 2–8°C. The approved RSV vaccines have been demonstrated to have good protective efficacy, which extends over seasons, however the dose level administered to achieve this protective efficacy is relatively high at 120 µg per dose. This is substantially higher than the 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain included in standard dose influenza vaccines, and higher even than the 60 µg HA per strain included in high dose formulations [47]. We have shown in a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study that VXB-213 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response than the Arexvy RSVpreF3 antigen at the lowest dose levels tested (p = 0.003), likely indicating better presentation of neutralising epitopes to naïve memory B-cells. This result is consistent with previous findings where a fully optimised RSV preF antigen which included the same pair of disulfide bridge stabilisations and optimal deletion within the furin cleavage site was shown to elicit strong neutralisating antibody responses relative to the original RSV preF DsCav1 antigen [33]. VXB-213 incorporates the same ectodomain modifications that are present in this optimised RSV preF antigen. A further complexity exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (for seasonal influenza virus, COVID-19 and RSV). hMPV is another high burden respiratory virus with a comparable incidence rate and severity to RSV in the older adult population [10]. The prospect of adding further vaccines into the annual schedule is a challenge and would likely impact coverage. We have focused on developing liquid stable antigens for both RSV and hMPV to be combined in a bivalent vaccine to reduce burden on healthcare providers and individuals. While there are currently no approved vaccines for hMPV, there have been a wealth of pre-fusion stabilised antigens produced based on the learnings from RSV [21–24]. We chose two of these, DSCavEs2 [21] and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23], to include as comparators for in vitro analysis. Consistent with expectations, prefusion specific nAbs were able to bind with similar affinity to VXB-221 and comparator antigens, while nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 but not the closed pre-fusion stabilised antigen v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C. DSCavEs2 was then included as a positive control within a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study. Here, VXB-221 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response relative to HMPV preF DSCavEs2 (p = 0.0003), however it should be noted that differences in purification methodologies used here and those used by Hseih et al., [22] may have contributed to this difference. The 2.5-fold improvement in elicited neutralising immune response was unexpected given that DSCavEs2 has been highly optimised for stability of the pre-fusion conformation. Monoclonal antibody avidity to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 also appeared to be relatively similar, except for neutralising mAb DS7 which recognises an epitope shared between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. A potential explanation for the improved neutralising immune response may relate to DSCavEs2 being optimised for efficient cleavage at the F1/F2 cleavage site [21], whereas VXB-221 is non-cleaved. It has previously been suggested that F1/F2 cleavage assists in the formation of a stable closed trimer, which was assumed, based on the earlier results for RSV preF would be the optimal antigen for stimulating a neutralizing immune response [23,24]. While nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound with similar affinity to both VXB-221 and DSCavEs2, accessibility to the trimer interface may be different in the context of vaccination. Alternatively, there may be additional neutralising epitopes that are specific to the non-cleaved hMPV preF. Of note, proteolytic cleavage of hMPV preF is inefficient relative to RSV preF [48,49], and timing of cleavage within the viral life cycle has not been well characterised. Contrary to structure-based antigen design focusing on the closed and/or fully cleaved hMPV preF which have included multiple structure stabilising mutations [21–24], VXB-221 is expected to adopt an open and non-cleaved preF conformation. This conformation allows for broad display of neutralising epitopes with minimal modification away from the native sequence. However, we note that monoclonal antibodies targeting the internal interface of the hMPV F protein exhibit varying levels of neutralizing potency. While some, such as M8C10 and MPV465, show modest neutralizing activity, others like MPV-458 demonstrate both high neutralizing potency and cross-reactivity across hMPV strains, highlighting the potential importance of this conserved epitope for vaccine design [28,50]. In mice that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine VXB-241, we observed some reduction in the neutralising immune response to both RSV and hMPV relative to the monovalent vaccines. This effect was particularly evident at the lowest dosage tested, where the neutralising response to hMPV was reduced by 5-fold; this was not seen for RSV. This finding is consistent with the immunodominance of RSV F relative to hMPV F, however it is unknown whether this same phenomenon will be observed in human clinical trials. As with the MC2S platform, approved RSV subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) both include a preF stabilising trimerisation domain [13,14]. The trimer stabilising domain present in Arexvy and Abrysvo RSV preF antigen, is the T4 fibritin sequence-foldon based and the same foldon is also included in RSV preF DSCav1 and hMPV preF DSCavEs2 antigens [21,32]. It has recently been reported that foldon can stimulate an ‘off-target response’ in human vaccine recipients that may negatively impact vaccine potency after repeated administrations [51]. It was recently demonstrated that further stabilisation of the RSV preF ectodomain can facilitate the omission of a trimerization domain thereby eliminating any off-target immune response from this domain [51]. We also recognized the importance of reducing the off-target immune response and achieved this through the incorporation of multiple N-linked glycosylation sites into MC2S. This strategy provides the benefit of easy purification process without drawback of off target response. For each naive mouse immunogenicity study, we calculated the fraction of vaccine elicited IgG that was directed to the T4 fibritin based-foldon or the MC2S trimer stabilising domain, by directly coating antigen to ELISA plates. It should however be noted that direct coating can cause antigen denaturation and so such results may underestimate antigen specific or domain specific IgG responses. Nevertheless we found that typically 10–30% of IgG elicited to foldon containing antigens was specific to the foldon sequence, and therefore unable to contribute to virus neutralisation. This was highly variable and sometimes constituted 40–50% of the elicited IgG response. In comparison, the fraction of IgG directed to the MC2S domain was typically below 10% of the elicited IgG response. Even when mice were immunised with the bivalent VXB-241, in which both antigens contained an identical MC2S domain (with different ectodomains), there was very little overall IgG directed to MC2S. In an ongoing clinical trial by Vicebio, we are exploring the comparative immune responses against the trimerisation domains of both the MC2S containing candidate antigens, and Arexvy as an active comparator (NCT0655614). In summary, the candidate vaccine antigens developed for RSV and hMPV using the second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp platform show high production yield, high liquid stability, and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway to assess safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). The molecular clamp platform technology contributes to the stabilisation of the antigens and offers the potential to advance the development of safe and effective vaccines for prevention of multiple medically important viral diseases. A subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 generated with the non-immunosilenced, MC2 sequence, recently completed Phase 1 trial testing (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05775887) further demonstrating the broad applicability of the proprietary platform. The high yield and consistent production process of MC2S containing candidate vaccine antigens together with the focus on creating liquid stable, multivalent formulations, has the potential to maximise global distribution, improve vaccine compliance, and protect vulnerable populations from medically important respiratory viral diseases. All animal work related to this study was performed in accordance with policies for the proper use and care of animals set by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (AEC numbers: 2021/AE000123, 2021/AE000183, 2021/AE000571, 2023/AE000539). Experiments were designed to minimise animal numbers, and all animals were housed in suitable facilities with ad libitum access to food, water and environmental enrichment. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia by isoflurane inhalation by properly trained personnel. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation. Vaccine antigen coding sequences codon optimised for Cricetulus griseus and synthetic DNA was synthesised in vitro as gblocks (IDT). Antigen coding sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vector pXC-17.4 (Lonza Group, Basel Switzerland) by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stellar Competent Cells (Takara Bio) and screened for correct insertions by colony PCR. Plasmids from selected colonies were isolated and DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence fidelity. Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO-S culture (ThermoFisher) using manufacturer’s instructions. RSV and hMPV antigens were purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using either an affinity column coupled with monoclonal antibody 101F [52] or resin specific to the clamp domain (AVI8740, Avitide, Repligen). Additional antigens were purified by affinity chromatography with either MC (HIV-1 gp41) specific antibody, HIV1281 [53], SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody CR3022 [54], Nipah F virus specific antibody mab66 [55], or influenza H1 virus specific antibody 5J8 [56]. Immunoaffinity columns were prepared by chemical coupling of mAbs to NHS-Activated Sepharose Resing (Cytiva) using manufacturer’s instructions. Antigens were purified using high pH elution from immunoaffinity resin as previously described [30,31]. Affinity purification of MC2S containing antigens was conducted by pre-equilibrating resin with 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 50mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and eluted in 50mM Tris, 1M MgCl2, pH7.4, before then being buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4. Homogeneity of purified proteins was analysed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. Panels of antibodies specific to RSV and MPV F proteins were generated by cloning the antibody variable domains into mab-xpress vectors by previously described methods [57]. The genetic constructs were expressed in CHO-S mammalian culture and purified using a MabSelect Sure affinity column (Cytiva). The variable domain sequences for 101F [52], D25 [36], MPE8 [37], AM14 [38], DS7 [39], MPV458, MPV483, MPV467, MPV487 [40], M8C10 [25], CR3022 [54], mab66 [55], and 5J8 [56] were obtained from public databases. Purified proteins were characterised by standard ELISA using a panel of mAbs described above. Briefly, for RSV antigens ELISA 96-well Maxisorp plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 2 µg/mL of mouse isotype Motavizumab (ref). Plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk diluent (KPL, SeraCare)). Commercially acquired Arexvy (GSK) or Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens were resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and gently mixed to dissolve. Antigens were added to plates coated with capture antibody at 2 µg/mL in blocking buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T, these plates were then probed with a serial dilution of the stated monoclonal antibody, starting at 33.33 nM and serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. After incubating for another hour at 37°C plates were washed as above and bound mAb was detected using goat anti human HRP (ThermoFisher) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. TMB substrate was added and incubated at RT for 3 minutes 30 seconds before the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances were then read at 450 nm. Background absorbances of the full reaction without primary mAb were averaged and subtracted from the respective test absorbance readings. Antigen oligomerisation profiles in solution were assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL resin filtration column (Cytiva). Antigens (40 ug) were applied using a 500 ul sample loop. 50L batches of VXB-213 and VXB-221 were produced using each of the CHO K1 clonal cell lines to produce material for use in a human Phase 1 clinical trial. Briefly, cells were expanded in shake flasks and then a Rocking Motion Bioreactor (Sartorius), before inoculation into 50L HyPerforma Single-Use Bioreactors (ThermoScientific). Production batches were maintained for 14 days with an optimised feed strategy and standard monitoring for growth rate, viable cell density, pH, osmolarity, glucose level, lactate level, ammonia level and carbon dioxide level After the 14-day production run, cell culture supernatant was harvested by two-stage depth filtration and purified by AVI-8740 resin affinity capture, two ion exchange/mix mode column purification steps, viral inactivation with TNBP/PS80, viral nanofiltration and tangential flow filtration (TFF) into the final formulation buffer. Mouse immunisation studies were conducted using female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks of age, housed at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) Animal Facility in the University of Queensland, Australia. Mice were immunised with 0.5 µg, 2 µg or 3 µg per recombinant protein antigen stated (maximum dose 6 µg for bivalent group) with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). Immediately prior to mouse vaccination, the Arexvy antigen vial was resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and then mixed with AddaVax (InvivoGen). Each group (n = 8) was bled via the caudal vein 1 day prior to receiving the first dose (day -1). They were then immunised IM on day 0 and again on day 21 (3 weeks). On day 42 (6 weeks), animals were euthanised and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. The blood was allowed to coagulate overnight at 4°C before centrifugation to isolate the serum. Serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes for use in immunological assays. Mouse IgG titres were determined by standard ELISA as described above with the following deviations. Antigens were coated directly on the ELISA plates at 2 µg/mL and probed with a 1/20 initial dilution of mouse serum that was serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. Following incubation and washing, the bound serum was detected using goat anti mouse HRP (ThermoFisher) at 1:2,000 dilution, before detection and reading as stated above. To determine the total IgG, the serum was tested against the vaccine antigens. To identify ‘tag-specific’ reactivity (i.e., reactivity to either the MC2S domain or foldon domain), the serum was assayed against a Nipah F containing the respective tag. RSV A2 and MPV-GFP1 virus (strain CAN97–83) were propagated on Vero cells and stocks prepared were stored at -80°C. Viral titres were determined using plaque assay [58]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 5 × 104 cells/well in Opti-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After overnight growth to allow a confluent monolayer, serial dilutions of virus stock were prepared in Serum-free Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-Trypsin and 1X Glutamax in the case of MPV. Cell monolayers were inoculated with 50μL of virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After 1 hour incubation, in the case of RSV, the inoculum was topped up with overlay medium (Medium 199 with 1.5% methylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and in the case of MPV, the viral inoculum was removed before topping up with 1.5% CMC media. The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, overlay medium was removed, the cells were fixed (80% acetone) and plaques were immunostained with either RSV specific human IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific human IgG MPV483. The primary antibody staining was followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-human IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2,500). Plaques were read using an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) and titre was recorded as PFU/mL. PRNT assays were performed as previously described [58]. Briefly, mouse sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted 1:10–1:21870. Equal volumes of viral suspension made in inoculum media by addition of virus stock to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL were added to the serum dilution to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:20–1:43,740 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for the virus to be neutralised by serum antibodies. The inoculum media used for RSV was Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while the media used for hMPV was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK and 1X Glutamax. The residual viral infectivity in the sera/virus mixture was assayed by adding the mixture in duplicated to Vero cells monolayer cultivated in 96-well flat bottom plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for virus adsorption to take place. This was directly followed by addition of overlay media in the case of RSV while the viral inoculum was removed before adding 1.5% CMC media in the case of hMPV. The plates were further incubated for 72 hours before fixing the cells with 80% acetone and plaque visualisation by immunostaining as above. PRNT assays for SARS-CoV-2 strain 614G and Influenza virus H1N1pdm A/California09 were conducted with similar methodologies as previously described [31,59]. Nipah virus neutralisation titre was assessed by lentivirus-based pseudo particle assay, as per a method previously described [60]. Human plasma depletion PRNT assays were performed as above. In the case of RSV, human plasma was serially diluted then first incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour either alone or with RSV Fsol, DSCav1 or VXB-213 diluted to 0.5 µg/mL. RSV A2 was then added to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL and again incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixture of virus, human plasma and depletion antigen was then added directly to cells and the PRNT assay performed as above. In the case of hMPV, the presence of antigen within the human plasma depletion PRNT assay had a non-desirable effect of directly blocking viral entry, presumably by receptor binding. Instead, 1.4 mg of VXB-221 or DsCavEs2 were each coupled to 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin (Cytiva), as per manufacturer’s instructions. A control 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin was produced with coupling buffer alone in parallel. The three Sepharose resins (control, VXB-221 and DSCavEs2) were inactivated and washed as per manufacturer’s instructions and then equilibrated with PBS. 1 mL of heat inactivated (HI) human plasma was added to each Sepharose resin and incubated on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature. Antigen depleted and control depleted human plasma were then collected into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and passed through a 0.22 µM filter syringe to ensure sterility and removal of Sepharose beads. Antigen depleted and mock depleted human plasma were then used directly in the hMPV PRNT assay as per mouse sera. Plaque visualisation for human plasma depletion PRNT was completed as above, however with RSV specific mouse IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific mouse IgG MPV483 followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2500). Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.2 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com. Mann Whitney Test was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between treatment groups in neutralising immune response. The limit of detection (LoD) for neutralisation assays is defined as half of the initial serum dilution factor.

Title: Retail sales rebound in June after 2 straight months of declines
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/retail-sales-june-increase-0-6-percent-tariffs-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T13:44:42Z
Full Content:
Consumers picked up their spending in June after an earlier pullback, despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after two consecutive months of spending declines, a 0.1% pullback in April and a 0.9% slowdown in May. Retail was buoyed earlier in the year by car sales as Americans attempted to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. The erratic consumer spending is taking place during a period of mixed signals about the economy as well. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, but the U.S. job market is proving to be very resilient, and major tariffs keep getting postponed. Healthy spending continues, with a heavy focus on necessities, rather than electronics or new appliances. Yet consumers haven’t completely cut out spending on nonessential goods. Sales at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, rose moderately. “Consumers are only feeling a modest amount of pressure from tariffs, and any weakness here is not having much of an effect in forcing them to pull back on more discretionary areas of spending such as restaurants and bars,” wrote William Blair’s macro analyst Richard de Chazal. Yet Chazal fears that the administration may be picking up false assurances from strong consumer spending. Consumer sentiment and markets have tumbled after aggressive tariff announcements, and many economist expect rising prices will have a greater impact on consumers before the year is over. Retail sales in June included a 1.2% gain in sales of autos and auto parts. Spending expanded across most major categories including clothing and personal care. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Electronics and appliance retailers, furniture stores and department stores all saw sales declines. The products sold in these sectors are heavily imported. A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet,” said Long in a statement. “There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. Business owners say it’s become very difficult to manage supplies and inventories. Americans, when they do shop, are generally steering clear of the things they don’t absolutely need. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation data makes it increasingly likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are for at least a bit longer. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices before reducing borrowing costs. A notable litmus test about the state of the consumer was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. And again, those who were spending prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the big retail events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June showing resilience despite anxiety high over tariffs and the U.S. economy WASHINGTON -- After an earlier pullback, consumers picked up their spending in June despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after declining 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales in April fell 0.1%, pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. There was broad-based strength across the board. Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Restaurants sales rose 0.6% , while online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Autos and automotive parts dealers rebounded with a 1.2% increase. There were a few weak spots like electronics and appliance retailers and department stores, both of which had sales declines. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet," said Long in a statement. "There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal.

Yet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs. Americans have continued to spend, which is what the Fed had hoped to curtail a little bit with rate hikes. One big litmus test was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. Still, those that were buying prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the Amazon Prime events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Uber just made its robotaxi play — with a big investment in Lucid

Uber is turning to Lucid as it looks to play catch-up in the robotaxi wars. More than four and a half years after Uber sold off its autonomous vehicle division, the company is investing $300 million into Lucid as part of a new robotaxi deal. Lucid will make the vehicles for Uber's robotaxis, based on its Gravity EV. Uber is also partnering with self-driving technology company Nuro, which will power the autonomous driving capabilities. Uber expects the tech to launch "later next year in a major US city." "Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to transform our cities for the better," said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. "We're thrilled to partner with Nuro and Lucid on this new robotaxi program, purpose-built just for the Uber platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world." Lucid's stock price jumped more than 43% in pre-market trading following news of the partnership, while Uber's stock price was slightly up before the opening bell. Uber said it plans to deploy a fleet of 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. The company said its first prototype is "already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas proving grounds." The robotaxi wars have been heating up over the last year, with market leader Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, operating autonomous rides in multiple states. Tesla launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi program in Austin earlier this summer. While the cars drive themselves, Tesla employees still ride in the vehicles with passengers for safety reasons. Lyft also plans to launch rides with AVs in Dallas as soon as next year, TechCrunch reported in February. Uber agreed to sell its autonomous vehicle division to startup Aurora in December 2020. At the time, it was grappling with a pandemic-induced downturn in its ride-hailing business. Since then, Uber has offered rides in autonomous vehicles in Atlanta and Austin through a partnership with Waymo. Riders can request a ride in an AV through Uber's app in those cities. If adopted widely, robotaxis would present a way for Uber and other ridesharing services to bypass human drivers. In January, Khosrowshahi said that Uber doesn't expect robotaxis to replace the company's gig-worker drivers for the next decade. Do you have a story to share about gig work?

Title: Wall Street’s AI Bubble Is Worse Than the 1999 Dot-com Bubble, Warns a Top Economist
URL: https://gizmodo.com/wall-streets-ai-bubble-is-worse-than-the-1999-dot-com-bubble-warns-a-top-economist-2000630487

Back in 1999, Wall Street lost its collective mind over the internet. Companies with no revenue were suddenly worth billions, “eyeballs” were treated as currency, and market analysts predicted a frictionless future where everything would be digital. Then the bubble burst. Between March 2000 and October 2002, an estimated five trillion dollars in market value vanished into thin air. Today, it is happening again. This time, the magic word is not â.com.â It is âAI.â According to Torsten Slok, the influential chief economist at Apollo Global Management, a major global investment firm, the current AI driven market bubble is even more stretched than the dot com frenzy of the late 1990s. And he has the data to prove it. âThe difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,â Slok wrote in a recent research note that was widely shared across social media and financial circles. The chart from Apollo compares the 12 month forward price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. In plain English, a P/E ratio measures how expensive a stock is by comparing its price to its profits. A high P/E ratio means investors are paying a premium and are betting on strong future growth. Slok’s chart reveals something stunning: in 2025, the P/E ratios of the top ten companies are even higher than they were at the absolute peak of the dot com bubble in 2000. Torsten Slok: "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s" pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 16, 2025 This means investors are betting so aggressively on AI giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Google that their stock prices have become detached from their actual earnings, even more so than tech darlings like Cisco and AOL were in the nineties. The top 10 companies driving this frenzy, which hold the most significant market value on Wall Street, include tech titans like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta. It is a super concentrated AI frenzy that is pushing a handful of mega cap stocks into nosebleed territory. You have probably heard that the S&P 500 is performing well this year. Here is the uncomfortable truth: most of those gains are coming from just those ten companies. The other 490 companies in the index are barely moving. This kind of narrow rally is incredibly risky. It means the health of the entire stock market is dependent on the performance of a very small number of firms. If Nvidia sneezes, the entire market could catch a cold. The problem is that Wall Street is treating AI as if it has already fulfilled every promise, from a productivity revolution to trillion dollar cost savings. The potential is being priced as a certainty, even though most of those gains have not yet materialized. In 1999, the internet was real. It did change everything. But that fact did not stop investors from wildly overpaying for companies that could not deliver on the hype. The parallels with todayâs AI excitement are chilling. Every corporate earnings call now dutifully mentions an “AI strategy,” just like every company in 1999 slapped on a â.comâ to its name. Stocks are surging on the vague potential of AI, not necessarily on real, current revenue. Wall Street is pricing in a perfect AI future without acknowledging the enormous risks: regulatory crackdowns, staggering compute costs, model hallucinations, or simply a slower than expected adoption rate. As Slokâs chart shows, the market is pricing these top ten AI heavy firms as if they are invincible. That is never a good sign. This is not a question of whether AI will change the world. It will, just as the internet did. The real question is how much investors are willing to pay today for profits that might not arrive for years, if ever. If history teaches us anything, it is that bubbles do not pop because the technology is fake. They pop when investor expectations dramatically outpace reality and the flow of easy money dries up. The more Wall Street bets on AI perfection, the more fragile this market rally becomes. If corporate earnings do not catch up to these sky high valuations, and soon, the market may not even need a specific trigger to deflate. The valuations alone could do the job. And when bubbles pop, they do not do so politely. They implode, wiping out trillions in value and shattering investor trust in the process. The technology called AI will certainly survive. The top ten companies likely will too. But the portfolios chasing this dream without a parachute might not. Just like in 2000, when it seemed the internet had made financial gravity obsolete, the AI hype train is speeding toward a cliff it thinks it can fly over.

Bitcoin price is once again heading toward the $120,000 mark, but the big question traders are asking is—what will it take for Bitcoin to reach $150,000? Driven by a $1 billion futures short squeeze, strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, and growing institutional interest, BTC’s momentum is building. Support from Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, potential passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a $143K target all fuel the rally. With Cantor Fitzgerald eyeing a 30,000 BTC acquisition and inflation data stabilizing, Bitcoin could be ready for its next breakout toward $130K and ultimately $150K. Bitcoin is heating up again — and this time, analysts are setting their sights on a massive $150,000 target. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has surged past $120,000, gaining over 28% in just the past 30 days and reigniting hopes of a new all-time high. According to data from CoinShares, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $14.8 billion in net inflows since May, marking one of the strongest periods of institutional adoption in crypto history. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence and ARK Invest now forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000–$200,000 by early 2026, with some more aggressive models predicting a run to $250K if market conditions remain favorable.

Title: You’re Not Imagining It: AI Is Already Taking Tech Jobs

Time Published: 2025-07-17T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByRichard Nieva ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Between meetings in April, Micha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn’t mince words: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too,” he wrote. “This is a wakeup call.” The memo detailed Kaufman’s thesis for AI — that it would elevate everyone’s abilities: Easy tasks would become no-brainers. Hard tasks would become easy. Impossible tasks would become merely hard, he posited. And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. In the shuffle, people who didn’t adapt would be “doomed.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me — that they aren’t imagining stuff.” Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate; the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. It isn’t just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going forward; Chen notes too that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring,” said Chen, adding that companies are starting to focus more on employing experts in their fields. “The superstar workers are in a better position.” Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR company ADP, to examine generative AI’s impact on the workforce. The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century. Now suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers, rather than replace them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” over the next few years as the company begins to “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can’t be automated by AI. Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and automation. At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had slashed its workforce 40%, in part due to investments in AI. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring. The superstar workers are in a better position.” Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its workforce. The company didn’t explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech. Automating customer service at call centers alone, for example, saved more than half a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written by AI. “This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities,” one laid off Microsoft employee told Forbes. Microsoft didn’t respond to questions about the reasons behind its layoffs, but said in a statement: “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company. The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff plans. Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still be trying to correct for overhiring. According to one report released earlier this month by the executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, AI may be more of a scapegoat than a true culprit for layoffs: Of more than 286,000 planned layoffs this year, only 20,000 were related to automation, and of those, only 75 were explicitly attributed to artificial intelligence, the firm found. Plus, it’s challenging to measure productivity gains caused by AI, said Stanford’s Chen, because while not every employee may have AI tools officially at their disposal at work, they do have unauthorized consumer versions that they may be using for their jobs. While the technology is beginning to take a toll on developers in the tech industry, it’s actually “modestly” created more demand for engineers outside of tech, said Chen. That’s because other sectors, like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, are adopting AI tools for the first time, so they are adding engineers to their ranks in larger numbers than before, according to her research. Automating jobs has its limits, too. Last year, Klarna said that the company’s AI tools were doing the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents. But a year later, the company seemed to reverse course, announcing a recruitment drive to hire more human agents. CEO Siemiatkowski has denied the new hiring push meant the company was pulling back on AI. Instead, he said the new human agents would handle more of the higher-end conversations the company had previously outsourced. Siemiatkowski was not available for an interview, but Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom defended the strategy. “We rely on AI just as much,” she said in a statement. “However, we have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” she continued, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Klarna’s experiments show that deciphering which tasks are more suitable for humans, and which can be entrusted to machines, is an open question. Siemiatkowski has been one of the most vocal proponents of automation: to prove the point, when Klarna announced first-quarter earnings in May, he didn’t even show up. Instead, he arranged for an AI deepfake of himself to give the financial update and trumpet a profitable three months. The upside to the upheaval, Fiverr’s Kaufman said, is that people seem willing to learn. (The company hasn’t done any AI-related layoffs or hiring freezes, he told Forbes.) In his memo to employees, he said he would hold office hours to discuss the changing AI landscape with anyone who wanted to chat. He booked a conference room for 50 people. To his surprise, he showed up to find 250 employees waiting for him. “So it was just, ‘All right, let’s do this,’” Kaufman said. He told employees they needed to be proactive to learn new AI techniques, and not just wait to be taught. “I'm going to help anyone who is motivated to help themselves.”

A few years after Amir Satvat landed his first video-game job at the age of 38, layoffs started piling up across the industry at companies such as Xbox maker Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. Seeing many of his new peers let go, he became motivated to lend a hand. Satvat built a website and filled it with a range of free resources tailored for out-of-work game talent. It includes two still-growing lists — one of job postings and another with contact information for hundreds of people he enlisted to provide support, such as résumé reviews and mock interviews. "I was like, what if I made the most comprehensive job listing site ever?" Satvat told Business Insider of his thinking when he got started on the initiative in late 2022. "I'm good at modeling, scraping the internet." Satvat also created a Discord group for the site's users to network with each other and he's given away thousands of tickets to industry events that he acquired by partnering with their organizers. He said he doesn't charge or make any money off his career site, describing it as a purely philanthropic side hustle. Based on user feedback, Satvat said his efforts to date appear to have helped around 3,900 ousted game-industry workers find new jobs, a feat that earned him the inaugural Game Changer award at last year's annual Game Awards show in Los Angeles and this year's Giving Award from the nonprofit Games for Change in New York. Those honors come as the game industry has been grappling with an exceptionally high volume of layoffs. An estimated 37,600 jobs have been shed since 2022, according to an online tally of termination announcements and media reports compiled by Farhan Noor, a technical artist in California. Like employers in many other industries, game companies overhired during the pandemic but other factors have contributed to the cuts, too, such as rising production and marketing costs. Satvat has been a gamer since he was a kid, and by high school, he knew he wanted to work in the industry despite not having artistic inclinations. "I just liked business stuff," he said. But after earning undergraduate and graduate business degrees, he couldn't find any game jobs near where he lived on the East Coast, and staying close to family was a nonnegotiable. "I come from a very tight knit diaspora of a Persian community," he said. Satvat spent several years in business-development roles outside gaming, most recently in a remote one at Amazon's cloud-computing unit. In late 2020, after his first year at Amazon, a colleague introduced him to Ethan Evans, a leader in the company's gaming division. Satvat explained that he was a devoted player of franchises like "World of Warcraft" and "The Legend of Zelda," and the conversation ultimately landed him the kind of job he'd long desired. "It was transparent how much he knew the [game] community and loved it," said Evans, who also didn't start his career in gaming and is now an executive coach. Satvat "wasn't trying to get a promotion. He was trying to move from one thing to another to get closer to something he wanted to do." About a year later, though, Satvat reluctantly resigned from Amazon because the Seattle-based company began mandating in-office attendance, which meant he'd have to relocate. He said he was fortunate to quickly land his current job, a remote business-development position at Chinese game giant Tencent. The person who previously had it reached out over LinkedIn to say he'd just left the company and that Satvat should apply for the role. Satvat later learned that this person found him through mutual LinkedIn connections and was aware of his career site. Now 43, married, and the father of three boys, Satvat works out of his home in Connecticut and continues to spend about 15 to 20 hours every week updating his career site. He also gets help from about 20 volunteers who are aligned with the project's mission of "empowering gamers at every stage of their career." Satvat told BI that it was his successful mid-life pivot to gaming from enterprise software and earlier, healthcare, that made him confident he could become a de facto career guru. When asked for his best advice for job seekers, including those looking to change industries, he pointed to old-fashioned networking. "Spend all your time meeting people," Satvat said. "Every single job I've gotten has been through a relationship."Correction: July 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date Satvat met Evans. It was late 2020, not 2021. Jump to

Title: Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi took us inside his $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, which closes today

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?” With tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.” The tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.) His advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.” And it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com 150 more countries will get tariffs of 10%-15% President Trump said letters would be sent to each government informing them of the “deals” they would receive. He also said he was “indifferent” to negotiating further with Europe. Trump claims he has changed the formula for Coca-Cola The president said the company had agreed to use cane sugar in its recipe moving forward instead of corn syrup. The company did not immediately confirm the change. JPMorgan plans data fee that could hit crypto JPMorgan’s plans to charge fees for access to customer account data could make it economically impossible for many consumers to use stablecoins and crypto, according to three industry executives, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation. “This would cripple the crypto industry,” one of the execs said. How Carney approaches Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has a remarkable way of keeping President Donald Trump calm and collaborative—so much so that he’s been dubbed the “Trump whisperer.” Here’s how he does it. Markets fluctuate on Powell moves Meanwhile, President Trump maintained on Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell despite reports this week of a letter Trump had drafted to do so. Markets dropped earlier in the day, but finished slightly higher on Wednesday than where they started. HPE reaches deal with Elliott Management Hewlett Packard Enterprise will give activist investor Elliott Management as many as two board seats as part of a new agreement following the latter’s criticism of the struggling company. The pressure on HPE CEO Antonio Neri won’t stop, however, and he could still lose his job. That Epstein thing won’t go away In a long post on Truth Social, the president insisted that anyone calling for the release of further information held by the government regarding Jeffrey Epstein was participating in a “hoax.” He said he wanted a decisive break with his own supporters who continue to push for more transparency around what the Department of Justice knows about the late billionaire financier and how he gathered his fortune: “I don’t want their support anymore!” Context: Epstein claimed he and Trump were friends for many years. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.32% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.7% in early trading. China’s CSI 300 Index was up 0.68% this morning. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in early trading. Bitcoin is holding on at the $118K level. Macquarie on the “fiscal capture” of tariffs: “Traders are staying complacent in the face of the new ('August 1') US import tariffs; they may reason that Pres. Trump doesn't want to preside over another market crash. But there's also the more ominous possibility that Trump has "moved on" from using tariffs to extract concessions, and is now using tariffs to boost tariff revenues. If that's the case, August 1 may see a flood of new higher tariffs, as well as retaliation. This "fiscal capture" of tariff policy shouldn't seem peculiar. After all, there are a myriad of reports that Trump's desire to replace the Fed's Chair also comes from a need to "fiscally capture" monetary policy, thus reducing the federal government's interest burden should debt levels rise,” per Thierry Wizman. Wedbush on woes at ASML: “View: ASML's preliminary remarks highlighted the impact geopolitical tensions and threatened US tariffs are having on future business prospects. While ASML's bookings (~25% ahead of prior expectations) seemingly point to solid near-term conditions; management pointed to a lack of clarity around future results given the potential impact of policy decisions. ASML management noted for instance a 30% tariff on European goods could for instance lift the price of an EUV tool from €250 to €325). As such, management suggested they could not at this juncture confidently forecast revenue growth in 2026 (a result that in turn is weighing heavily on the stock this AM),” per Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault. Wedbush on Q2 tech earnings preview: “In our view the Street is underestimating the underlying AI driven growth ahead and we expect a very strong 2Q tech earnings season over the coming weeks that further validates our bullish thesis led by Big Tech stalwarts … Our top 5 Wedbush tech picks for the second half of the year are Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Palantir, and Tesla,” per Daniel Ives et al.

Full Content:
Shareholders of tech and social media giant Meta, have sued for more than $8 billion in in fines and legal reimbursements, in relation to an alleged privacy scandal at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, as per reports. The action is based on relevations that data of millions of Facebook users was accessed by now defunct political consultant Cambridge Analytica, and alleges that around 11 executives — including Mark Zuckerberg himself and former Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg — indulged in insider trading and used the company to conduct illegal data harvesting, while the board failed to oversee the social media giant's operations. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Spokespeople for Meta did not immediately respond to queries, Bloomberg and Reuters said. The report said that the Meta shareholders, comprised largely of union pension funds, alleged that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg “ran the company as an illegal data harvesting operation”, while the board “completely ignored their duty to oversee the company”. The claimants want reimbursement of over $8 billion in fines and legal costs from executives to Meta, which was paid to settle the 2012 privacy agreement violation to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trail in the Facebook ‘privacy scandal’ began at a Delaware court on July 16 (Wednesday), and is scheduled to last until July 25 (next Friday), according to a Reuters report. Notably, the case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J McCormick — the judge who rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package, as per a Bloomberg report. Among the defendants in the case are, venture capitalist and current board member Marc Andreessen; and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The suit alleges: Notably, after the insider-trading claims, Zuckerberg moved to seal his stock-trading strategies from public revelation during the trial, claiming that it is highly confidential information. Mark Zuckerberg controls about 61 per cent of the Meta board’s voting power through a dual-class share structure, effectively granting him sole control over the board composition and corporate strategy — past, present and future, the BB report noted.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect GE Aerospace Stock to Move After Earnings Thursday

Full Content:
GE Aerospace (GE) is set to report second-quarter results before the opening bell on Thursday, with traders expecting a sizable move in the company's stock by the end of the week. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate GE Aerospace stock could move about 5% above or below Wednesday's close to around $266 by Friday. At the high end, that would put GE Aerospace shares above $280, after a strong year for the stock so far. The shares have surged about 60% in 2025 as GE Aerospace has passed the one-year mark since General Electric's transformation into three separate companies was completed last April. GE Vernova (GEV) is slated to post its own second-quarter results next week. GE Aerospace shares have been volatile after their recent reports. In the last two quarters, shares rose more than 6% on the day of each report, while they fell 9% and 5.6% on the day of the two prior reports. Last quarter, GE Aerospace topped estimates as the company said it was taking steps to mitigate the negative impact tariffs could have on its profits. GE Aerospace is expected to report a 13% increase in revenue from the same time a year ago to $10.27 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected have jumped nearly 20% to $1.43, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who cover GE Aerospace call the stock a "buy," though not all of them expect the stock to continue rising, with some price targets below Wednesday's close. Their average price target, however, assumes slight upside at about $270.

Title: Samsung Galaxy S25+ Review

Time Published: 2025-07-16T21:51:23Z
Full Content:
The Galaxy S25+ is the often overlooked Samsung smartphone model that I think hits at the sweet spot of the lineup. It’s a terrific device that’s only let down by middling battery life. And, yes, I know this review isn’t particularly timely. Samsung announced the initial Galaxy S25 family–which then consisted of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra–in January and then started shipping the phones to customers in early February. Then it added the thin new Galaxy S25 Edge in May and its related foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7, earlier this month. But these are collectively Samsung’s flagship phones for 2025, and they will remain current until new models appear next year. Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! "*" indicates required fields Δ My Samsung Galaxy S25+ looks stunning in the deep Navy blue color I selected at purchase. And that color extends from the back to the sides, which are often lighter if not a natural metal color, as on other phones, giving it a subtle visual differentiation that I really like. The body is made from a mix of aluminum and titanium, with elegantly rounded corners that are perfectly matched by the display corners. It’s a tad smaller than my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL at 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 inches, but it is thinner and, at 7.69 ounces, dramatically lighter than either. My iPhone is 0.33 inches thin and weighs 8.01 ounces, while the Pixel is 0.33 inches thin and weighs 7.8 ounces. It’s immediately noticeable. Flip it over, and you can see that Samsung arranges the three rear camera lenses in a vertical stack in the upper left corner on the back, with each encircled with a black metal ring. It’s a handsome and even minimalist look, with no additional visual interruptions save for the tiny circular flash cutout. My iPhone and Pixel have busier camera setups on their backs, but the Pixel does make up for it by using a camera bar that keeps the phone steady on a table in use. I use a case with all my phones, though, and the stock Samsung case (below) at least reduces the wobble. The minimalist design continues with the buttons: There are just three–Volume up, Volume down, and Power–and they’re arrayed on the right side of the phone. Beyond that, you’ll find the USB-C port on the center bottom, a nano-SIM card slot on the bottom, a speaker slit on the bottom, and microphone holes on the top and bottom. Samsung is widely credited with making the best displays in the industry, and the Galaxy S25+ is an excellent example: It features a 6.7-inch Dynamic LPTO AMOLED 2X display panel that that effortlessly matches the vibrancy and crispness of that on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The display has a tall 19.5:9 aspect ratio, a Quad HD+ resolution of 1440 x 3120–about 513 pixels per inch (PPI)–and an adaptive 120 Hz refresh rate. That’s a higher resolution and pixel density than I get from my iPhone or Pixel 9 Pro XL, but they’re comparable, at least to my eyes. The display is also incredibly bright at 2600 nits. This makes it suitable for use outdoors, even on the brightest of sunny days. The S25+ display is surrounded by small bezels, and it’s interrupted only by a small, centered camera cutout that I actually kind of like. It’s the right position for this type of thing, and it doesn’t get in the way that much when viewing media. The S25+ display panel is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, and you can increase its touch sensitivity in software if you use a screen protector (I did not). There’s also a separate accidental touch protection feature that I did enable. And IP68 dust and water protection, like other flagships. Speaking of which, Samsung provides Galaxy S25+ customers with a ridiculous number of display settings to consider, though most are familiar. You can configure Dark mode to come on at a set schedule, of course, and toggle options like Adaptive brightness, Eye comfort shield, Adaptive color tone, and Screen mode (which can be Vivid or Natural), but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You can separately configure the Screen zoom (scaling) and font size and style, change the screen resolution (which I left on the middle FHD+ 2340 x 1080 option, between HD+ 1560 x 720 and QHD+ 3120 x 1440), and even choose whether to replace the elegant round camera cutout with an artificial black bar at the top of the display. As with other modern smartphones, the S25+ also supports an always-on mode that’s reasonably customizable. It will display the date and time in large fonts at the top, of course, but you can toggle the wallpaper display and whether that wallpaper hides the background (for people or pets) and displays the Now bar (a sort of live update feature that can also appear on the Home screen) as needed, and even when it displays. I configured it to come on when tapped only, to help with battery life, but it can remain on, come on automatically, display on a schedule, or display when there are new notifications. Whew. As one should expect, the Galaxy S25+ delivers flagship-class components that elevate the performance and responsiveness of the device. It’s powered by a 3-nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that utilizes the same Oryon CPU cores as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips for PCs and provides powerful Adreno 830 graphics and Hexagon NPU capabilities. These parts deliver Apple-level enhancements over their predecessors, with a reported 45 percent gain in CPU performance with 44 percent better power efficiency, 30 percent better GPU performance with 40 percent better GPU efficiency, and 45 percent faster hardware-accelerated AI performance. And Samsung keeps things as cool as possible with a vapor chamber design that seems to work wonders. I often note my iPhone and Pixel getting hot, but that was rarely an issue with the S25+. The Galaxy S25+ also provides 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB or 512 GB of fast but non-expandable UFS 4.0 solid-state storage. (If you need more storage, the larger Galaxy S25 Ultra can be configured with up to 1 TB.) Performance is predictably top-notch, with none of the pauses and wait times that sometimes bog down my Pixel 9 Pro XL. There’s a certain silky quality to touch interactions with the display, and apps don’t so much load as they do snap into life instantly. I don’t typically play games on phones, of course, but I did check out Call of Duty: Mobile and Limbo for research purposes. For Call of Duty, I installed the higher resolution textures and played with an Xbox wireless controller hard-wired over USB, and the experience was incredible, with flawless performance and a surprisingly strong audio-video presentation. Limbo is a sideways scrolling puzzle game. It’s simpler, less busy title with touch controls and an atmospheric, wind-swept soundscape that also looked and played wonderfully. Granted, it doesn’t stress the system as much as Call of Duty, but it’s also the type of game one could pick up here and there as needed. The Galaxy S25+ delivers modern connectivity across the board, with global support for the latest 5G cellular data, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC. It supports dual-SIM configurations with one nano-SIM slot and embedded-SIM (eSIM) capabilities; you can use two eSIMs simultaneously and have multiple downloaded eSIMs on the device for later use. The USB port on the bottom of the phone is of the USB 3.2 Gen 1 variety, meaning it supports a pokey 5 Gbps data transfer speed, which is vaguely disappointing: At this point, flagship phones should support at least 10 Gbps. The S25+ provides stereo speakers, one on the bottom of the device and one less obviously in the earpiece hidden in the top of the display. This configuration is typical for smartphones, and it often leads to a sound imbalance that can be minimal or overt, depending on the device. And it is indeed obvious on the S25+, with the bigger and more exposed rear (right) speaker delivering more volume than the other. This is true in games, like Call of Duty: Mobile, and in media apps like YouTube and YouTube Music. But it’s also not entirely problematic since most will use earbuds or headphones for extended periods. The phone ships with Dolby Atmos for immersive sound with automatic optimizations, a nice software equalizer, dialog boost and loudness normalization options, and an Adapt Sound feature that lets you use age-based presets or create a personalized sound profile, albeit only for headphone/earbud use. It also upscales music and the sound in videos automatically when using headphones/earbuds. But the biggest advance here is a unique feature called Separate App Sound that solves one of my biggest issues with Bluetooth. Typically, you connect a phone to a Bluetooth speaker, start playing music or whatever, and every once in a while, a notification or other non-media sound will temporarily tune down what you’re listening to and interrupt it with its unpleasant and unwanted sound. I’ve long wanted something I think of as per-app Bluetooth, and that’s pretty much what Separate App Sound is: It lets you pair an app (like YouTube Music) with an audio device (your Bluetooth speaker) so that the audio playback from that app is never interrupted. Instead, notifications and other sounds will go through the default audio playback device (the phone’s built-in speakers). Nice! The camera system in the Galaxy S25+ is identical to that provided with the smaller S25 and a step down from that in the bigger and more expensive S25 Ultra. This was by design on my part: I have typically purchased phones with the best-possible camera system, and I’ve wanted to test a theory that this was perhaps unnecessary. I almost bought an iPhone 16 Plus in late 2024 before retreating back to the more capable iPhone 16 Pro Max. But for this go-round, I finally went for it. And I do not regret doing so. The hardware is solid, though only the main (wide) lens provides a high-resolution sensor. You get a 50 MP main lens with a 24 mm focal range, an f/1.8 aperture, dual-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF), and optical image stabilization (OIS); a 12 MP ultra-wide lens with a 13 mm focal range and a 120-degree field of view; and a 10 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, 30x digital zoom, PDAF, and OIS. There’s also a 12 MP selfie camera on the front, with a (wide) 26 mm focal range, an f/2.2 aperture, and dual-pixel PDAF. Those are just numbers. If you’re looking for something more impressive in the Samsung space, the Galaxy S25 Ultra takes it to 11 with a 200 MP main lens, a 50 MP ultra-wide lens, and two (!) telephoto lenses, one 10 MP/3x optical zoom and the other 50 MP/5x optical zoom. And while it’s a little unfair to compare the S25+ to higher-end phones, my iPhone 16 Pro Max has two high-resolution sensors, in the main/wide and ultra-wide lenses, while all three of the lenses on my Pixel 9 Pro have high-resolution sensors. I’m not sure that it matters most of the time, and I was never let down by the Galaxy S25+ over almost two months of steady use. More importantly, I never wished for more impressive camera hardware: Samsung was rightfully criticized for its overly processed images in the past, with overly vibrant colors, but it now provides what I think to be an ideal and subtle color boost that puts photos over the top. Across the board, in all lighting conditions, I was consistently happy with the quality of the photos I got out of the Samsung, and with little to no effort on my part. Details are crisp, the ultra-wide lens doesn’t distort the edges of images as much as the iPhone does, and even night mode shots are clear, without any obvious noise. Here’s the same shot with the wide (top) and ultra-wide (bottom) lenses: Portrait mode is also terrific, so much so that I’ve started using this style more because the S25+ is so good at it. Consider this shot of my sister, which is to me a non-standard Portrait mode setting, but a nice effect regardless. OK, it’s possible I got a bit carried away with Portrait mode, but I kept returning to it again and again. Telephoto is limited to 3x optical, but I never found that to be a problem. I only rarely need higher magnification, and Samsung’s digital/hybrid zoom is good to about 20x, which is impressive. At 30x, noise and hand unsteadiness become an issue, but of course they do. Here’s a quick look at what the various zoom presets look like: Samsung’s Camera app is excellent, with a simple and logical layout that was clearly one inspiration (the other being the Pixel Camera app) for the simpler new Camera app design coming to the iPhone with iOS 26 later this year. It has the expected mode slider on the bottom, obvious mode-specific options in an expandable menu, and quick access to those options one might toggle on/off on the fly at the top of the display. I feel like I’m always fighting the iPhone Camera app, but this is almost intuitive. Indeed, this phone might be currently my favorite for taking photos. The automatic nature of it all is impressive, and unlike the iPhone, I rarely if ever needed to retake shots to get the look I wanted. I don’t take much video, and nothing of note with the S25+, sorry, but it supports 4K60 and 8K30 for those that need more than Full HD. Ditto for selfies, though I did at least get a few, and they are all high quality, with good details. Samsung lets you toggle between two depths/zoom levels on that camera. Samsung provides a familiar dual-biometric authentication system, with an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint reader and Face Lock facial recognition. Also familiar, only the former is secure enough for banking transactions via whatever wallet app, and so I found myself resorting to the fingerprint reader a lot. It’s fast and reliable, at least, but this is an area where Samsung and Android in general still lags Apple and its nearly flawless Face ID. The trade-off for the thin and light Galaxy S25+ form factor is battery life: I was hoping and expecting that this phone would at least outperform the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is unexceptional in this category. But that was not the case. Real-world smartphone battery life is a bit difficult to measure accurately, but the Galaxy S25+ disappointingly delivers even less battery life than the Pixel. When I’m just working from home, which is typical, it can last the day. But when I go out into the world and actually use the phone–perhaps with Google Maps, Uber, Instagram, or whatever–it needs a mid-day top-off. If you have a fast enough charger–the S25+ supports up to 45 watts over a wired connection, though it doesn’t include a charger of any kind–you can fast-charge the phone’s 4900 mAh battery to 65 percent in 30 minutes, so that helps. It also supports 15-watt charging over Qi2 if you have a compatible case: I bought a third-party case to test that, and it appears to work fine. There’s even 4.5-watt reverse charging, though it’s more likely that the S25+ will need the juice than whatever other compatible device you might have. Still, it’s a nice feature, and it can be used while you’re charging the phone over USB. Samsung rightfully wants to control its own destiny, so it has built its own software and services, and its own user interface, on top of Android to create an entirely unique experience. This is understandable, but I’ve also criticized the company for overdoing it because Samsung smartphones are overloaded with superfluous and redundant apps and services, promotional upsells, and overlapping licensing agreements that are fraught with privacy implications. In this new AI era, this situation is, if anything, worse, with Samsung shifting from its ridiculous Bixby assistant to a combination of in-house Galaxy AI solutions and the Gemini-powered advances that Google delivers. It’s a lot to take in. So this time, I went in a different direction. I simply gave in. Navigating between the dozens of apps that Samsung supplies and the myriad of options scattered throughout Settings and elsewhere, I said yes to it, checked every box, signed in to my Samsung account at every prompt, enabled every feature. And while I am uncomfortable recommending that to anyone, I will tell you that it was OK. Aside from a few strident requests to purchase an extended warranty through whatever Samsung app, my blind acquiescence didn’t bother me too much. Instead, I adopted a sort of “don’t see, don’t worry about it” policy, similar to what I do with Windows 11 most of the time. Those apps can’t hurt me if I don’t see them. Samsung’s influence can be seen all over this device, and most of it is positive or at least non-problematic. It starts with the One UI 7 user interface, which is terrific and getting even better in the One UI 8 update that I’m now testing, and extends to Samsung’s first-party apps and services, including the DeX desktop mode that will come soon to Android more broadly, and the newer Galaxy AI features that permeate throughout the device, across the system and the apps. One UI is so good I wrote an article dedicated to this topic, and as features like Live notifications expand and improve, it’s getting even better. There’s a debate to be had about whether One UI or Pixel Android is “better,” but they’re both terrific in their own ways. I like all the helpful features that Google adds throughout Pixel and feel that it is superior from an overall functional perspective. But I like the look and feel of One UI much more. And it does have some terrific and unique features of its own, of course. The Samsung implementation of Live notifications is quite close to the Dynamic Island feature on iPhone, and I love it. The software bloat problem is real, of course. I used a handful of Samsung apps, mostly obvious choices like Phone, Camera/Gallery, and utilities like Calculator, Contacts, Clock, and so on. But I never found myself using any Samsung apps per se, and apps like Bixby (still hanging in there for some reason), Calendar, Gaming Hub and the dozens of others are mostly non-threatening or at least decent. There are some oddballs in there, like Global Goals, Samsung Members, Samsung News, Samsung Notes, Samsung Pass–seriously, it goes on and on–but … whatever. I don’t like having two stores, two wallets, two whatevers. But it’s … OK. Galaxy AI is likewise a mixed bag. Generally speaking, the Google AI features are better, which is especially obvious in photo editing. And because Samsung bundles Google Messages, I could take advantage of its writing assistance. But Samsung is going deep here: The S25+ features Call assist for real-time translation during voice calls, Writing assist across multiple apps, Interpreter for live translation with voice or text output across apps, Note assist in Samsung Notes, Transcript assist for voice and call recordings, Browsing assist in Internet (the Samsung web browser) for summaries, translations, and so on, Photo assist, Drawing assist for transforming sketches into generative AI artwork, Audio eraser for eliminating background voices, wind, and other noises from audio and video, AI-created Photo ambient wallpaper, a Now brief on the Lock screen and Home screen, Health assist in the Samsung Health app I didn’t really try, and probably more I’m missing. It’s a lot, and describing it all could fill a book. But I will point out that you can choose to process all AI tasks on-device for privacy, with poorer results. (I left the spigots open for the best results.) And some of this stuff is truly useful. You can use natural language to find settings in the Settings app, a feature Microsoft will fully add to Windows 11 later this year. The image editing tools are extensive, maybe too extensive, with generative edit and sketch functions, and there’s a fun Photo Studio feature in the Galleries app that can turn a photo into a comic, 3D cartoon, sketch, or other style (below). It works pretty well, but it has trouble with multiple people and will only transform one. Looked at another way, Samsung is at least adding AI where it makes sense. That Photo studio feature is a reasonable example. It could have been implemented as a standalone app, but it’s better and more discoverable as a feature of an app that people will use to manage and edit photos. This will ease customers into the AI functionality naturally. Or you can ignore it as you may with so many other app features. Samsung provides seven years of Android OS and security updates, matching the best available support lifecycle in the Android phone market. That’s stellar. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999 for a model with 256 GB of storage, and you can upgrade to 512 GB for a total of $1199. But no one should or would ever pay that price, as Samsung phones are almost always on sale, and typically with friendly trade-in values, especially for previous-generation Samsung devices. As I write this, the S25+ is $150 off, for example, and Samsung is offering up to $480 in trade-in credit. (Or more, as my wife’s Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra would actually fetch $500 on trade.) You can get a Galaxy S25+ in Navy, Mint, Icy Blue, or Silver Shadow regardless of where you purchase the device. But if you order directly from Samsung–which you probably should, for its sales and elevated trade-ins–then you can also choose between three additional colors: Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold. The unit I purchased is Navy, and it’s a pretty deep navy blue color that I truly enjoy. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ is a superior choice for those who prefer Android. It’s also my favorite smartphone overall, currently, though the broader Apple ecosystem is stronger and more cohesive than that offered by Samsung. It offers incredible performance, a terrific display, an incredibly strong camera system that’s also easy to use, future-proof components of every kind, and a support lifecycle that will quit on this device long after you do. Yes, Samsung bloats its devices with unnecessary apps and services, and the battery life could be a bit better. But One UI 7/8 is my favorite smartphone interface, and Galaxy AI combined with Google Gemini is coming along nicely on the AI front. When you factor in the regular sales and better-than-necessary trade-in values that Samsung offers, it’s almost a no-brainer. This phone surprised me and in all the right ways. The Galaxy S25+ is highly recommended. Pros Cons Paul Thurrott is an award-winning technology journalist and blogger with 30 years of industry experience and the author of 30 books.

Title: The Reason Tesla Is Failing Is That Elon Musk Is an Extremely Unlikeable Person

Time Published: 2025-07-16T21:24:56Z
Full Content:
Tesla has been losing money hand over fist — and the culprit is clear: Elon Musk, the company's CEO, needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror. In the wake of his latest Robotaxi gambits, which involve a dick-shaped service area map and a fare price rise from $4.20 to $6.90, it becomes clearer every day that the 54-year-old billionaire is a deeply unserious individual whose attempts at humor only drive home how annoying he is. Obviously, this is neither the first nor the last time Musk's massive dearth of likability has been pointed out. Considering all the other self-inflicted wounds he's sustained lately, it's impossible to ignore how inextricably his irritating public persona is linked to Tesla's nosediving sales — which have gotten so bad that a wave of its executives have either jumped ship or been fired. Though he was no saint prior to reigniting his on-off bromance with Donald Trump last year on the presidential campaign trail, the multi-hyphenate business owner's toxic politicking since then has hemorrhaged a staggering amount of goodwill he gleaned back when he was an environmentalist who wanted to save humanity by taking us to Mars. (In 2016, public polling showed that Musk's net popularity stood at a balmy +29 percent; now the figure stands at negative 23.) Nowhere is that Trump slump more evident than in Tesla's stock value, which is down a full 20 percent from the beginning of 2025. As the electric vehicle company's value has plummeted, its CEO was busy showing his derriere in as many ways as possible: by doing two Sieg Heil salutes on stage at the inauguration, establishing his stupidly-named Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) wrecker agency, and generally being a bigoted jerk on X, the social network he has transformed into a far-right haven under his ownership. And of course, the addendum to all that political self-sabotage might be the most incredible detail yet: Musk inevitably flamed out with Trump in spectacular style, meaning he now holds none of the influence that could help his business interests — and has managed to alienate huge swathes of potential buyers on both the right and the left. Aside from all that, Musk also seems to have been asleep behind the wheel of Tesla. The EV company has suffered tremendously under the billionaire's leadership over the past 18 months as he oversaw the disastrous launch of the ugly and crappily-made Cybertruck, became the repeated subject of government investigation over its incorrectly-named "Full Self-Driving" feature, and unleashed its uber-glitchy Robotaxi service onto the unsuspecting streets of Austin. When a regular person makes jokes about dicks and weed, it's generally cringe in an innocuous way. When the world's richest man does it — especially while hamstringing the federal government, being virulently bigoted, providing a safe space for literal Nazis, and operating "assisted driving" features that keep maiming and killing people — it's not at all cute. And the markets, obviously, have responded in kind.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Netflix Stock to Move After Earnings Thursday

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report earnings after the bell Thursday, with traders expecting shares could swing after the results. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate Netflix stock could move about 6% or $70 in either direction Friday. A move of that scale would lift shares to just above $1320 at the high end, or leave them near $1,180 at the bottom end of that range, their lowest level since May. Netflix shares lost about 1% Wednesday to close at $1,250.31. Still, the stock is up 40% in 2025 so far. Netflix's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 6% over the past four quarters, and risen in three of those instances. In April, shares rose a little over 1% after the streaming giant beat analysts’ expectations, thanks in part to higher subscription and ad revenues. Those results came shortly after Netflix executives reportedly said their goal is to double the company’s $39 billion in revenue last year by 2030. Analysts are largely bullish on Netflix’s long-term outlook heading into the earnings report, and expect the streamer to report rising revenue and profits. Of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 rate Netflix stock a “buy,” while just four give it a “hold.” Their average price target of about $1,330 is roughly 6% above the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.

Title: Corporate turnaround artist Jim Lanzone is “sticking to what users need” as CEO of Yahoo

Time Published: 2025-07-16T18:54:21Z
Full Content:
On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, cohosts Diane Brady, executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media, and editorial director Kristin Stoller talk to Jim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo. They talk about the company’s nostalgia aspect, where it fits in a new era of search and AI, and keeping Yahoo a “guide to the World Wide Web.” Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Jim Lanzone: But if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet, I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Diane Brady: Good luck with that. Brady: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Leadership Next. The podcast about the people… Kristin Stoller: …and trends… Brady: …that are shaping the future of business. I’m Diane Brady. Stoller: And I’m Kristin Stoller. Brady: Yahoo, that’s what we’re talking about. I say “Ya-hoo” because I’m Canadian. Stoller: It’s your accent, and I love how you say it. But I, as a ’90s kid, say Yahoo. Brady: Yeah, and I say pasta. So it’s Yahoo and it’s Jim Lanzone, and he is the new CEO of a brand that is kind of hard to figure out. Tech, search, it’s media. It has been a cautionary tale. Is it a turnaround tale? What do you think? Stoller: I just want to bring us back for a second, to the golden age of Yahoo. Founded in 1994, think back, Diane—what were you doing then? And did you have a Yahoo email address? Or what was your email provider? Brady: I had just graduated. I was living in Asia. I remember my first email had many numbers in it, so I don’t think it was Yahoo. And look, I remember my first real encounter was when I came to the States, and I remember the arguments over whether we had to put the exclamation point, because they had an exclamation point in their name. And it used to honestly annoy me. It felt a bit sort of hubristic but yet it was the big beast in town. Stoller: See for me, all the cool kids at school had Yahoo and AOL. I was stuck with CompuServe because I think my dad got it for free. Yeah, I hated it. But okay, so now we’ve moved past—and although I don’t want to say move past, because they still have people with Yahoo email addresses, it’s still the number-two email I would assume, after Google or Gmail. Brady: A long number two. It has 3 billion hits a month, which makes you wonder about that intersection of influence—do eyeballs and influence still mean the same thing? And look, he’s an interesting guy. He’s an entrepreneur. He was at Tinder. He’s basically been a turnaround artist. He’s been there four years. And so what do you think? How much is Yahoo on your radar screen these days? Stoller: It’s really not. But I will say that I have two friends who work at Yahoo Finance and Yahoo News, and they love it and tell me they do really good work over there. Other than the journalism part of it, and I use Yahoo Finance to check stocks. I use it for stuff like that. I don’t use it for search. I don’t use it for anything else. And it was kind of a brand that I had thought, you know, had its heyday back in the early 2000s and they had so many missed opportunities. They lost the chance to buy Facebook, they missed out on a bunch of other deals. And I just thought they were kind of stagnant. Brady: But it lives to see a new day and like you, I’m very fond of the media properties, top notch journalists that they hire, I have to say. And look, I look forward to hearing what his vision is. You know, again, it’s, it’s past its 30th anniversary. As you pointed out, it’s still here, much like Ask Jeeves, which he also worked at. Stoller: Yes, he was the CEO of that pre-Google, pre-ChatGPT. Brady: So how do you turn around a legacy brand that has become a case study in failure. What does success look like? And it still has incredible traffic. So the bones, as he would say, are probably pretty good. Yeah, lots to talk about. Stoller: We’ll be back with Jim after the break. Brady: We’re entering an era of innovation unlike any we’ve witnessed before. You all see it: The pace of technological change is staggering, and it’s challenging for any leader to keep up. We spoke with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, which is the longtime sponsor of this podcast. Here’s his advice for leaders on how to navigate this new world. Jason Girzadas: There’s probably nothing more important for CEOs, no matter what organization they’re leading, to really be thinking about technology’s impact on our workforce. It’s really a function of, how do you think about technology in concert with your workforce? We at Deloitte talk about it as the age of width, the age of technology with your workforce, and really embracing this idea of the codependency of technology and workforce. We’re also an environment of a very tight workforce where there’s a scarcity of top talent. That’s going to be the challenge for organizations, to demonstrate to top talent that they can grow and evolve the work that they do, working with leading technology in a very aligned way. Finally, it’s what top talent really wants in an organization, is to learn and grow and to be part of an organization that’s supportive of them actually embedding technology in their work. Brady: Jim, I think the first thing that would be good is define Yahoo as it is now, because obviously, it’s, you know, media, it’s been search, it’s email, it’s so many different—it’s a tech company. I mean, how do you define it in your mind? Lanzone: It’s funny, and I’ve said this a couple times, but historically speaking, they would ask that question of the Yahoo CEO onstage at conferences. Brady: Oh, well, here we are asking. Lanzone: It’s a bit of a gotcha. So it’s a great first question. But because, you know, again, I think all the different ups and downs in the company and along the way as a public company, which there’s a lot of different pressure that came along with that, had to try to figure out what its way was going to be as the internet was evolving. And I can go into it, but our team picked it up after that, so we didn’t have all those pressures. You can step back and look at it when we picked it up, and understand, first of all, it’s a conglomerate of a lot of different products. Some of those products have media or or use media as a feature. Some are utilities, right, like search or email. Even within some products. So let’s take sports where we definitely have media. We have the number one NBA podcast, we have the number one combat sports podcast, we have the number one newsletter. But the spine of the book for sports is fantasy sports. You know, where we’re the OGs, you know, sports scores and things like that. And those are more products. So I think at the end of the day, Yahoo is a product company, and I can go all into product… Brady: …a product conglomerate. A conglomerate of different products. Lanzone: But that is common these days. If you think about Meta, right? You have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have WhatsApp, you have Oculus. Now, you have AI. Even Google, with anything from Android to Waze to Android to YouTube. Amazon, obviously, same thing. All of the major internet companies, and Yahoo, after all this time, is still a top five internet company in the US and globally. We get there as a combination of brands, but Yahoo—and my team, we had to figure this out when we got here, you know, after all this time. We just had our 30th anniversary this year, you know. Brady: And you’re approaching your fourth. Lanzone: Yeah, I started [at the] end of September of 2021, right after Apollo bought the company. But you know, what’s our reason for being? Like, why does Yahoo exist, and why has it been so successful through all the ups and downs? Why is it still so large and used? And you know, the answer to that was one answer, which is in all the categories where we were still at the top. So we’re number one in finance, number two in news, really number two in sports. Brady: Doesn’t sound like much of a gotcha question, then. Lanzone: Well, all of these categories where we were still at the top is—we were still fulfilling the founder’s original mission of the company, like back in 1995, which was to be the trusted guide, you know, through the Wild West of the internet. It’s just that that job changed between 1995 when you were just trying to find websites to get things done, all the way through to now, where you’re deploying things like AI to help people get things done, right? So how you do it changes, but what we do, being the trusted guide to the internet, doesn’t change. Stoller: So I’m a kid of the ’90s, born almost around the time Yahoo was founded. So I remember it very vividly. I remember—also, I think it’s funny that this is very full circle for you, coming initially from Ask Jeeves, you were the CEO of that, and now coming back to an internet company, which is very full circle. So you’re right. I think Yahoo has gone through a bunch of ups, a bunch of downs, totally different than what it was in 1994. But I think that, you know, in the mid-2000s people were really worried about this company. And so when people came to you and said, “Hey, Jim, do you want to take this job?” What made you say, Yes, I will. I will do it in this uncertainty.” Brady: Jim, I like a challenge lens. Lanzone: Yeah. Well, I always wanted a crack at this. I knew every previous regime of this company, a lot of friends and colleagues who went through here…. Brady: …should we rate them all? Lanzone: No, I mean all the different teams, like, you know, Jimmy Pitaro and Jeff Weiner and Brad Garlinghouse. You know, just the really original teams. You know, even the first team, because I really had two things… Brady: …Jerry Yang? Lanzone: Jerry Yang, who’s still involved with the company. I just had him back for an all-hands meeting. He was amazing, yeah, for the 30th. He’s an investor in the new version of the company after we spun out of Verizon. It’s really a new corporation. So it, yeah, and he invested in it. So it’s amazing. But no, I had done two startups in the ’90s, or was involved with two early-stage companies in the ’90s. So that led me to Ask Jeeves, that was my first turnaround, and I learned the hard way, like, why were we able to do that? And we, you know, I think we almost 50x the stock from where we picked it up at the crash, in 2001 to the peak of where we got to before we sold to IAC. And we had a lot of traffic, but we had a product that had seen better days, and a brand that had been through the ringer, and a team that had been also through it because it was the first crash. So you had to rebuild all that. And once you got the basics right and you got the team rebuilt, and you were actually executing on your basic value proposition, you know, then you could innovate. And we innovated our tails off in that time period, 2003 to 2007. We were, you know, we were the ones who innovated, who really created the [inaudible] approach to search. That was what we were known for. We were the first major partner of Google when they started to syndicate AdWords, and that really made us profitable. Stoller: …and I used Jeeves like the OG ChatGPT, I would ask it so many questions. Brady: I want to bring us up to 2025, I mean, like, but let me ask, because I do—think you mentioned turnarounds, and Ask Jeeves is just one of the many you’ve done. And what was it, to Kristin’s point, that you saw as the opportunity with Yahoo? Because we’ve just heard a litany, and it’s all very correct as to where you’re number one. Obviously, it’s also been a case study in what not to do. What did you see as the runway that you could create? Lanzone: Well, remember that the—let’s say, the case study in what not to do, it was very interesting… Brady: …don’t turn down Google. Lanzone: Well, if you go do the forensics, which I did, if you are in the late 1990s early 2000s, search doesn’t have a business model yet, and you are the trusted guide to the internet, and there’s been a market crash and everything, outsourcing search to Google, and before that, they did [inaudible] me for the best price possible, which included a link to Google with their logo on the page that when you got there was only a search box, which is how 91% of internet sessions started at the time. That was like a good deal, just so happens that, you know, it really ceded search to Google, and I think the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out what it should be, and it went into media, and it tried to look at social, and it took another crack at search, and I mean, all kinds of things as a public company. It then eventually sold to Verizon in the mid-2010s. And so when we got it, it was after all that. So we had the luxury of not being public, but those basic ingredients were there, which was a huge audience, huge and very important categories. And so both Apollo, who bought the company, and then brought me in as CEO, and me, we, you know, I talked to them before they bought the company. Our thesis was, if you could get that asset at the right price, and it was around $5 billion and if you look around everybody in the top 10 Comscore internet companies, they’re all trillion-dollar companies. You could work with that. And so I, you know, again, I could go through it, but we set about the turnaround process using those raw ingredients, and that’s where we are today. Stoller: What was the hardest decision you had to make when you took over? Was it cutting, restructuring, betting on a new product? What was really difficult for you? Lanzone: Well, you knew all that coming in. You knew that there was gonna have to be some turnover on the team. You also, and this has been true every time I come into a new company, you also find a lot of talent and can redeploy them in new ways. So step one is always rebuilding the team, getting great people involved. You know, as a CEO, especially if something is big, you can’t do everything and so that always is step one, and, and so yeah, from there, there are certain products that, you know, like search or email that are huge and things you need to invest in to get back on track. And, and then ones where, you know, in the case of email, it hadn’t really been upgraded. And I mean, literally over a decade at those levels. And so when you start putting those things in place, you can start to get early returns. The hardest decision was probably how early on we had to essentially renovate our ad tech group, which was something that both AOL and Yahoo had spent many years acquiring a lot of companies, 30-plus companies. Brady: What do you mean renovate? How does one renovate an ad tech group? Lanzone: Well, we had to make some really hard decisions about what we’re going to invest in and where we didn’t have a right to win. And so we were doing a lot of things, a lot of different businesses. We had a native advertising business, we had a supply-side platform. And we shut those down. In some cases, we outsourced those to others, and then we decided, well, where we can win is our DSP, our demand-side platform, so we’re going to invest there. So that decision, my second year there, or, you know, actually made the decision before my first anniversary, required, you know, having a lot of people leave the company and doing deals to outsource things that we had been building for years. But that decision saved hundreds of millions of dollars a year on the cost side, but really strategically, let us refocus on put something that could really be a big asset creation opportunity, which is our DSP, where we are now the world’s largest private DSP, competing with trade desk, Google, Google’s version of that, Amazon’s version of that. And, you know, I think we’re still early days now and innovating in that space. Brady: I want to talk about what’s ahead. But one of the things I like about your career, Jim, is the eclectic nature of it. And I know I’ve, I’ve had an eclectic career myself. One of the benefits is you get to work with all kinds of cool people. And I think of your career, you’ve got Les Moonves, you’ve got Barry Diller. You mentioned Jerry Yang. I mean, there’s so many different people. I’m curious who stands out for you as either a mentor or just somebody—I mean, these are personalities. I’ve met them myself, and how has that influenced you? And when you look back, who do you think of fondly, or maybe not so fondly? I mean, we’re open to both here. Stoller: Yeah, give us all the dirt, Jim. Lanzone: When you’ve been around doing this this long, and again, I’ve done consumer internet now for basically 28 years, and have had those different times. I can bore you with how many of those are influential on me. Brady: No, go ahead. I want to hear. Stoller: Name-drop, feel free. Lanzone: When I left Barry and [unintelligible] I did a startup from scratch. And Bill Gurley, who wrote for Fortune for many years, and Jeff Yang were my two main investors. And the idea for that came from another big mentor of mine, Dave Goldberg, who was a very close friend, but also a huge mentor, we came up… Brady: Yeah, I knew Dave. SurveyMonkey. Lanzone: Well, he did SurveyMonkey when I went to do Clicker, but the whiteboard was in his EIR office, a benchmark of doing the future of video search and and then Blake Krikorian, another very close friend who passed away a year later, who was the founder of Slingbox, was also on the board of that startup, and was a huge friend, but also a huge mentor, you know, of mine. Yeah, you learn different things from all of them along the way, and, and obviously, with Barry, you know, I remember, we were in the back of a car, and I’ve always been fascinated by, well, by media, but also by, like, the history of things. And so I would always pepper him, like, how did you greenlight Airplane? And I get the story about he and Michael Eisner, you know, had offices next to each other, and he heard laughs coming out. And you know, they both had been reading the script. And he says, but before that was The Kentucky Fried Movie. And I mean, you just hear this history of how they do these things. And I remember him saying to me, you know, this is in the back of the car in like, 2007, I wonder if we started today, if we would have been as successful. And obviously, 18 years later,the answer is, of course. Barry Diller is one of the world’s best entrepreneurs, it turns out, you know, over the last 30 years. But his way of drilling into the core idea of things. Always, I remember him saying, there’s always another way around the mountain. And I always say that to my team, if we get stuck on something, Brady: You know, he told me once, the hardest thing to hire for is curiosity, which always stuck with me, because he’s right, and you’re very curiosity-driven. That’s the way you talk to people, isn’t it? You mentioned, you just go and you try to get to know them. Lanzone: Well, that’s part of his drilling down on, on the core idea, you know, and not just going just off the data, which, again, is also very important. I’m a product person at heart, you know, if I take a new job, drilling into the data is probably the first thing I do. But between him, less, where, you know who ran, obviously, that company very successfully as a public company. But what was also the number one? Brady: This is when you were at CBS Interactive? Lanzone: At CBS Interactive, and knowing that it also was about gut and the core idea, and I’ve other friends, like Tony Fadell, who helped… Brady: …with Nest… Lanzone: … with Nest but also created the iPod and helped create the iPhone. And there’s a lot of it that is the art side too. And I really believe in the right-brain side of this, the taste side of this. And in the early stages of a turnaround, you can’t always show that side, but then you always get to the point, right? At CBS, the initial challenge was they had bought CNET, which was a struggling public company, and it needed to be turned around first. The reward for that was we created CBS All Access, which was one of the first streaming platforms, and we launched that in 2014, five years before HBO Max and Disney+ and that was at the end of the day, a gut decision. We got criticized when we launched that, that it wasn’t going to work, and how dare one network have its own streaming service? So, yeah, I’ve learned that both of those are very important. Stoller: For us, I feel like, or at least for me, and maybe you, Diane, when I think Yahoo, I immediately think media. And I think it’s just, you know, we’re journalists. We have all these… Brady: Not email? My sister still has her Yahoo email account. Stoller: Yeah, as I told you earlier, I was a CompuServe girl then an AOL, so sorry, Jim. Lanzone: Still have all of those URLs. Stoller: Yeah, exactly. But I’m wondering about, you know, from a non-journalist perspective, how do you kind of view the media industry at Yahoo and just in general, how are you looking at what’s next for your journalists? Lanzone: Yeah, well, part of what we figured out when we got here was, again, you do the forensics on the company. What makes it successful. The history of why Yahoo even got into media at all was not by being investigative journalists or on the enterprising side of news, but by being the first and best aggregator of news and being a partner to people like Fortune, by sending them traffic, sharing the revenue. It’s funny to see AI companies now trying to ink those deals. We have 1000s of those deals that go back 20+ years with companies. We still operate that way today. If you go to our page, we are sending traffic to Business Insider who would have, you know, those stories and help them be successful. We then, you know, accentuate that with our own journalists who are providing context to that. Whether it’s sports or Brian and Julie and team in finance, that really is where Yahoo is strong, and how we do journalism. And over the last three years, as we figure out what’s our role in that ecosystem, I think our role is to be the trusted guide, to be purple, to be neutral, and to help our users wherever they may fall on any spectrum, get to the content that they’re looking for and be partners with people. Brady: Asset-light. It sounds like an asset-light strategy. If I look at the humans as assets, does that position you well, for the next generation of where we go with media? Lanzone: Well, we do—look, we also have a lot of humans… Brady: …we know several… Stoller: …yeah, I know two of them! Lanzone: If you come up to our studio, uptown, we have an amazing studio, and, you know, by the end of this year we’ll be doing 50 hours a week of original programming just in sports. So we also are producing media, but again, I would say, in service of helping our users accomplish their goals. And that is a little bit different, right? Because in finance, they’re trying to make money or save money. In sports, they are trying to beat the snot out of their friends in fantasy, or they’re trying to be a smarter fan about their team that they’re following. It always is in service of something that our users are trying to get done. And so I would just say our role in the ecosystem of media is, I think it’s very important, because we have a huge amount of traffic, and we send a huge amount of traffic, and we’re very thoughtful about how we do that and what that product needs to look like, and how we partner to keep it a very healthy media ecosystem. We’re big believers in that. If we violate trust with our users, and I would say over time, that is something that you know, probably as the different variations of Yahoo and different owners of Yahoo, it probably wavered a bit, but we knew that is the first thing. Like, we have to be the trusted source for people, and that means we also have to have trusted partners. Like, we can’t be sending people to click bait or to attention vampires who are just trying to get you. We got to send them to the highest quality content. Stoller: It seems like you have competitors in a bunch of different spaces. You have, like Google, dare I say, you have other media competitors like Fortune. Brady: And AI. I keep waiting for the deepfake news call, right? Stoller: Yeah. I think you know, what they’re going to do to search is wild. Who do you view as, like, your biggest competitors? And how are you fighting back? Lanzone: Well when we did the original Google deal in 2002, Eric Schmidt, people said, “How could you do that?” I mean, we were the fourth-ranked search engine. We survived everybody else. Stoller: So people were questioning it back then? Lanzone: Oh yeah, how could you do that? And Eric had the term “co-opetition,” and… Brady: …as he would… Lanzone: …but we were public and they weren’t. So we were almost their tracking stock for the first couple of years, and so, yeah, I mean, we helped each other on that front, and maybe we competed for users. But from our standpoint, we always had to have a unique reason for being relative to them. That’s true of anything that I’ve ever run. You know, CBS products, Yahoo products, I mean, they all have to be unique. So that’s how I think about it. If you talk to my team, though, you would hear every single one of our team say the same thing, which is we really don’t get distracted by competition. You have to keep tabs, obviously, on the way the ecosystem is changing. When I took this job in September ’21 it was still 14 months before ChatGPT launched. That changed the world. That created opportunities and threats for us. I think they’re more market driven then, instead of individual companies and products necessarily. And we think about taking over Yahoo, we have so much to do that I really think we’re competing against ourselves more than we are anybody else, at least for now. We’ve just so many things, if we get those right, that we will keep growing. We are growing a really healthy clip again now, and so that’s really what I focus on. Brady: So let’s talk about that a little bit. And I want to unpack your background a bit more too. But where, you said it’s early days, what are you focused on right now? I mean in terms of your priorities, the pain points. I mean, what should we be expecting in terms of what’s around the corner. Because you’re private, you can tell us.. Lanzone: That’s been great. I still think of myself as an entrepreneur at core and a founder, but I’ve been wound up in all these public companies and larger companies. It does feel good to be able to do this in private for a while and in Apollo, as the, you know, full owners of Yahoo, we have some other investors, but it really is an Apollo company, they’ve been great. Because we were one of the fastest returning deals in the history of Apollo, and that’s enabled us to be all upside. And so they really have been letting us do this right and play a little bit of a longer game than you might get normally in private equity. And so I think about that product by product, and in terms of, like, what we do, you know from here. And I would say we are—the reason I think it’s still early days is step one was just fixing the things that were wrong. And you’d be surprised, like, how little this company, even on the very back end, had moved to the cloud. I’m just saying something as basic as… Brady: Even with Verizon as an owner, I’m surprised by that. Lanzone: You’d be surprised. And now I would say, is every pixel of that something that I want to put my name next to and say that is the best product that that can be? No. You know, I think there are 10 levels left to go here on what we can do. And I also always tell the team we can’t just be brats. And, you know, I always say skip levels of the video game, you know, you got to earn it every level by every level, to earn the right to innovate and progress. Now with AI, that’s added a whole other set of things that we need to do. I feel like we’ve been out ahead of that. We were one of the first ones to integrate, let’s say, AI into email to help people create, search, edit their mail. There are other, you know, parts of that that are coming. You know, same thing in search. Even things like fantasy sports have AI integrated to help you manage your team. There’s even a smack talking email that comes out, you know, from AI every Sunday night, whether you won or lost. Thinking about finance, you know this category and how it helps you build your portfolio. So besides the basics, we have to do that, and then there’s innovation and our hopes and dreams for where all these products can go next. I’d also lastly say the brand is another very important part of this, because the Yahoo brand did go through the ringer for a lot of years. Lanzone: That exclamation point used to always piss me off. Stoller: I like it. Lanzone: Yeah, people love it. Brady: It used to, now I have a different view. Stoller: So is it a marketing push to revamp a brand, or, how do you revamp a brand that kind of, as you said, went through the ringer? Lanzone: I mean, it takes time. Yeah, you really have to earn that. And again, having seen that movie a few times. The thing about Yahoo that is awesome, is that even though there is a bit of that, you know, that history and so people are going to want to ask that question, and we’re going to really have to earn it. There’s also this interesting latent kind of love for the brand that is in there and people, especially as you kind of get out of the Valley a bit, and I think the Valley has started to feel good about what we’ve been doing with the company. But to get to the, let’s say the average American, there is some latent love in there if you do it right. And including, you know, half of our audience today is Gen Z and millennials. Brady: You have a massive audience, we will point that out. Stoller: Half of them weren’t born when Yahoo was created, Lanzone: Yeah, and so, so everybody’s using Yahoo at a certain point in time, and we’re top five, we touch 90% of all the U.S. any given month. But again, as a brand, you have to earn that right to where they’re proud to be using Yahoo and be talking about it. And so that’s brick by brick, over time. And we, you know, we’ve started down that pathway. Step one, you have to have great products. If you don’t have that, people are going to talk smack about the brand, let alone love it. But I think we’re on the pathway there. And then we, you know, we started with small things up to big things. On the small side, through a really interesting event at South by Southwest, where we partnered with this retro, kitschy brand called Poolsuite, and we had a ’90s-vibe party that everyone was like, “Oh, this is the coolest party in South by Southwest. I can’t believe it’s Yahoo.” Stoller: You’re leaning into the ’90s cheese I love. Lanzone: And that was, like a small one. On the larger end, we did a Super Bowl ad this year for the first time in 23 years, but we did it in a super unique way, where we weren’t asking for anything. We weren’t trying to market our way to success. It was just getting the brand back out there. And again, we did it uniquely. We had Bill Murray. Bill Murray is a very unique character. We only bought the ad locally, so it was actually very cost-effective as well. And then the ad was really just a 15-second teaser that got people into an online experience using Yahoo Mail, where you would email back and forth with Bill Murray, and he would send you additional videos that were vignettes that told this story that he wrote with his writing partners. Stoller: How’d you convince Bill Murray to do it? Brady: He’s everywhere. He’s a good guy. Lanzone: Harder than you think. It was only the second ad he’s ever done. Stoller: What was the pitch? How’d you do it? Lanzone : Actually, he famously has no agent and no manager, and you have to call a 1-800 number. We somehow worked it through to get his attention and explain it to him. And Bill is interesting. He likes the underdog, and he loved the idea of working with Yahoo to help us kind of fight back. And I would argue, he almost really took us under his wing. Another example of that is that one of the things that they conceived of was that he would answer those emails live on camera at halftime. And up until the day before the game, we didn’t know if it was gonna happen. I mean, he really, he’s a busy guy. He was like in a band. He played a concert the night before. Brady: Can he type that fast? I don’t even know. Lanzone: So not only did he do it, but we announced it only 20 minutes before it happened through social channels. And we end up getting millions of people up against the Kendrick Lamar halftime show tuning in to watch Bill on camera, and he would, he was actually like, talking to the user who emailed in, and he would answer it live. He would do it into a microphone. He was saying what he… Brady: The beauty of improv. Lanzone: Yeah. And then he continued to do it the entire second half. Didn’t have, didn’t have to do it. And so it was a personal thing for Bill. And so, yeah, so I’m still in touch with him. He’s an amazing guy. Brady: I can picture you. The Yahoo CEO sort of emailing Bill Murray and getting good advice from him. Lanzone: He wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t authentic. And I think, again, if I were to say what the take on rehabilitating the brand has to be, is it has to be authentic. We can’t be too thirsty about wanting attention or trying to classically market your way there. Brady: You know, one of the benefits of working in different roles, starting companies, you discover what you’re good at. You know, when, when did you discover that you were particularly good at the things that you think are helping you in this role? Lanzone: That’s a great question. The whole way I started doing this was I went to law school. I hated it. I would have left, but I met my wife the first minute of law school… Brady: …stick around to court each other… Lanzone: …we were living together two weeks later, and that was 31 years ago. We’ve been together that whole time. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have stayed. And I had some friends who did the business school program, so I, with no experience, applied and got in, and that summer, somehow wound up working for a company that was digital in the old school way. They sold public records to like, law firms and, you know, businesses and private detectives whenever, through dial up. And my job was to get them an internet website. And the CEO thought I was, you know, I was an early adopter of the internet, obviously, and used it a lot. So I copied the fantasy baseball website that I used at the time, and we turned that into, by the end of the year, a top 100 website. I worked with the engineers to build it. I did all the PR. I put the ads on the page. I did everything. And so that led to me joining a startup while I was still in school, and we raised money and so I was always a product person. So I’ve always come at this, when I got to Ask, I was the head of product. Our turnaround was so successful that my boss, Steve Berkowitz, who was the CEO, got hired to run all of internet for Microsoft. Satya [Nadella] reported to him, and that’s how I got promoted to CEO. So I only got, you know, I never really applied for a job. I always started companies that have been acquired, and in this case, I was part of Apollo’s research team, essentially for whether you should do Yahoo. But I come at this as a product person, as a founder, not as big boss man corporate, you know, person. And I think the best internet companies are still or technology companies are still run that way. Whether you are the founder, you’re not. My job is to push to be the, you know, to determine whether something is good enough, and to really drive that, obviously, to help set the strategy and the roadmap, but to be a source of momentum. And you know, that grind of doing a startup or doing a turnaround, that’s all I’ve ever done. And so the way to do that is you push and with great people around you, and that that’s what we do. Stoller: If you could go back in time and give advice to Yahoo’s leadership, you know, during the dotcom boom, what would you want to say to them as a CEO today? Lanzone: I really, I mean this in a non… Brady: …buy Facebook… Lanzone: …well, here’s the thing, not everybody, if everyone can hear the whisper, everybody tried to buy Google. Ask Jeeves tried to buy Google. They couldn’t hit the number. So they bought a company called Direct Hit, which actually was the inventor of all user behavior algorithms that that Ask eventually licensed to Google. So there’s always another way around the mountain if you don’t get it. Brady: Success comes in many forms. Lanzone: I really don’t know that any of us can put ourselves in the position of a public company, of the biggest internet company in the year 2000. The market crashed, I think, in March of 2000. We were writing our S1 to go public, my startup, though, and then one by one, everything crashed. So AltaVista didn’t get out. And then this happened. So how do you go back and tell them not to outsource search to Google, right? Or if you do make it white label, don’t give them a link and a logo. Brady: I remember Priceline was having us bid for groceries and web fans. So things change. But well, let’s put you then circa 2025, and you are in a big legacy brand. If you were starting out now, you know, entrepreneurial as you are, what would you be doing? Would you be doubling down on, you know, some of the AI companies—because here we are at the dawn, you know, we had the internet, we had 2.0 and here we are at the dawn of a whole new age of innovation. Obviously, you’re navigating through that, trying to bring in those tools and that innovation. But what would you be doing at this point, starting out? Lanzone: Man, there’s so many ways. I would be founding a company, you know, and it would have to be in the AI space, obviously, from my background. And by the way, my son has now just turned 24 and it’s his second year out of college. He’s a programmer at an AI startup. Called Meeno… Brady: …and shoutout to Meeno, well done, son. Lanzone: But by the way, there are others. So you know, one of my longtime colleagues, who’s a board member, has a very successful startup called Array that has defined the next generation of labor, and is deploying, you know, real people and humans. You know, they talk about manufacturing, moving to China and needing to bring it back. There’s already a lot of great people in the US doing this. His company does that. It definitely deploys AI and technology. But starting great companies doesn’t have to be that, but if it was me, of course, it’s too… Brady: …but you’re also trying to recruit great talent. So why do they want to come to Yahoo right now? Lanzone: Look, a lot of places you go, first of all, you’re going to be a cog in the machine. So a lot of people who come here, and by the way, it’s a lot easier to recruit in year three than it was in year one. You know, we’ve had, we’ve got some momentum now, so we’ve got some people’s attention. And by the way, as an example, we will get at least 1,000 applications for every person that we hire as an engineer. So we do get a lot of incoming, but it’s to be able to have that impact. Number one is, personally, they can have that impact. Number two, we have, you know, one of the top five largest audiences in the US and globally, to actually deploy the thing that you’re building, which is the hardest part of any consumer internet startup, is actually getting a real audience and we start with that as kind of a late stage startup. Again, we already have that audience, so that really does attract people. Stoller: Jim, I have a bit of a fun one for you, because I can tell that you are a very good storyteller. Besides getting to email and meet Bill Murray, what is the wildest or most unexpected thing that you have done as CEO at Yahoo, or just coolest that you want to tell us about? Lanzone: The Bill Murray one must have… Stoller: Is that top five? Lanzone: Yeah, would have been. I mean, I’ll tell you an interesting brand moment. I was sitting in Levi’s Stadium, which is the 49ers’ home, and I’m a longtime season ticket holder, and… Brady: Condolences, I’m just kidding. Stoller: You’re doing very well. Lanzone: Oh, the Niners, it’s been a great run. Super Bowl is next. Brady: Never mind. Stoller: Clearly we don’t know sports. Lanzone: We’ve been robbed a couple times. But I was sitting there and I guess I didn’t realize this before I took the job. But every time the Niners score a touchdown, up on the screen it turns into a Yahoo, a Yahoo Sports highlight of the touchdown at the end, there’s actually a yodel with the logo going across the page, and all 80,000 people scream Yahoo at the top of their lungs in a yodel and in the middle of Silicon Valley. And that’s when I knew there was something to work with here, brand wise, that it could be done. Stoller: Had you planned the Yahoo yodel, is that a thing? Lanzone: No, I inherited that. That was a deal that was done 10 years prior, during Marissa’s time, and I renewed it. And because it’s just such a, it’s such a great moment. That was such a surprise, for sure. Stoller: I slightly want to ask you to re-create the yodel right here. But I feel like… Brady: …no, let’s do it. Lanzone: We do have, you know, the “easy button.” Yeah, we do have yodel button easy buttons. Stoller: Oh, that’s good branding. Lanzone: Hilariously, they are—we have an amazing social team, and they’ve done things like for April Fools, this year. They created a, if you know about the touch grass, they created a keyboard that was all covered in grass, everything. But another thing they do is they actually, for a limited time offer, they sold those yodel buttons on there… Brady: …Okay, we have to do the yodel… Lanzone: …they sold out in five minutes, like $20 each. Stoller: Who’s buying these? Lanzone: That was another, you know, surprising time for sure. Brady: Sounds like a lot of fun over there. Stoller: Would you ever change the yodel? Is it too iconic? Lanzone: We did, in a way that you wouldn’t have noticed. We shortened it by two seconds. Brady: Oh, so then was it Yahoo. Come on, why am I the one doing the Yahoo yodel? You’re the Yahoo CEO. Lanzone: It’s too—it’ll get clipped by my team and used against me at company all hands meetings. Look, even having Jerry, you know, Jerry back this year, and showing a picture of the trailer that he and David founded the company in. Or, you know, we actually showed him that, not only are we back to his original mission, and how we’ve articulated that kind of made him well up a little bit. But the original Yahoo website, the one that was pre-incorporation. So you said ’94. Incorporation was ’95 but they did have a website available in 1994. It said, “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web…always under construction.” And we took that and we made it like the number one core operating principle for us that Yahoo, you know, look, we’re still here after 30 years, a lot of ups and downs. We have some ups now, and we’re on the right track. But if you couldn’t, you know, kill us before, we’re on a track now where you could see another 30 years if we do this, if we do this right. So always under construction to us, meant that, you know, everything about technology may change, right? Think about from the original time: video now, and social and AI, and just all the different parts of this. We still have to help people accomplish their goals… Brady: …make sense of the world… Lanzone: …we always have to be adapting, and that really is guiding how we think about the company. Brady: I’m thinking of Glengarry Glen Ross, “always be closing.” Different concept. You know, one thing that I feel bonds us all here, and you know, Oura should really give us product placement money, but we’re all wearing Oura rings for those who can’t [see]. And so I often think of the fact that to be a CEO these days is to be an elite athlete. And Kristin and I are not putting ourselves in your category, of course, but talk about how you manage your day, your energy, because I certainly look at my ratings every morning and consider my sleep and my energy. Lanzone: How’d you do last night? Brady: I never do well. I don’t like—but I… Stoller: She never wants to answer the number question with sleep, by the way. Lanzone: Well, I think today was seventy-something. Lanzone: How much REM sleep did you get? Stoller: I only got 23% last night. It’s pretty good, right? Brady: I operate on a different wavelength, perhaps. Lanzone: My wife and I also have Eight Sleep and it’s amazing, too. And it gives you a whole other score. Brady: I do think about the fact that it feels like, the attention to the physicality of the job and health, and obviously there’s many factors, but how do you manage that? And do you feel like you do it differently? First of all, you’ve got tools, and you’re wearing this ring on your finger. And how was your sleep last night? I’d be remiss not to ask you. Lanzone: Took me a while to fall asleep, then I crushed it after that. I think I had two hours, two solid hours of REM. That was like a lot. A funny side story is that Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura, and I, were entrepreneurs in residence at Redpoint Ventures in 2008 when I left IC. We were the only two, and we were in the bullpen together. Way back when… Brady: So is this you supporting your friend or do you actually like it? Lanzone: And then he worked at SurveyMonkey. So if you’ve been around a long time… Stoller: You know ’em all. Lanzone: Yeah, yeah. So no, look, I’ve gone through my fits. And so, you know, when you have kids for the first time, your [in your] ’30s and everything changes, you don’t realize, and you have to get your act together about staying in shape. And if you do something that you love, you work a lot. In this job, I also just travel a ton. I’m just on the road a lot for different events and conferences and for ad sales, and, you know, whatever it is to our different offices. So it’s harder. Brady: Do you have any hacks you want to share? I don’t, so. Lanzone: Honestly, I think it is just the same as the grind of running a company. And again, I saw in a different podcast, you asked somebody about a book, the book that I always go back to is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. If anyone wants to think that Nike happened overnight or they were just brand geniuses. I mean, it took years of building that company. And I think any company is like that, early stage, late stage, if you’re doing it right. I think it’s the same thing with your health. It’s the same thing with staying in touch with friends. Nothing’s just going to happen. You have to make it happen. And that could be getting on the treadmill or the elliptical or lifting weights or going for a run. It could be spending time with your spouse. It could be spending time with your kids. I make a really big effort not just to do that, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, so I spent a lot of time with my dad, you know, but also friends. And so, you know, I’ve gone to two live concerts in the last week. Stoller: Which ones? Did you go to Avril Lavigne on Friday? Lanzone: Well, the last one I went to, no, on Friday night, I was—well, I’m on the board of the Newport Folk Festival and Jazz Festival, which is like my passion project, and I’ve done that for about 10 years. So that’s more my jam on the music side. So I was at, there’s a band called The Hold Steady. Their lead singer is Craig Finn. He has a solo album that just came out. So his album release party was Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. And Kathleen Edwards, who’s this amazing folk indie singer out of Canada, opened and played in the band. They had like an-all star band, the guy from war on drugs was in it. And so my wife and I, we did date night and went, went to that. Brady: Newport Folk Festival. So, I mean, I always think of that now with the Bob Dylan movie. But of course, you know, so you’re a folk fan, that’s interesting, yeah. Lanzone: Well that, you have to go look at some of the YouTube videos, the movie isn’t exactly how that happened. Stoller: No, I knew that. Well, I read the book, and I was like, Yes, it’s very different. Brady: We vilified Pete Seeger too much, perhaps, or… Lanzone: …it was funny how it all works. You know, one of my biggest mentors in life, who was a CBS board member, was a guy named Bruce Gordon, who was the chairman of Newport. We actually live across the hall from each other in New York as well. So Bruce and his wife are our family here in New York, but I was also friends before he passed away with George Wein, who’s the founder. He was the creator of the Music Festival. He got a Grammy for creating—so if you go to Coachella or anything, it was because of George launching Newport Jazz originally, and then the Newport Folk. But yeah, hearing the old stories again, I love it, and hearing about Miles Davis and Nina Simone, or how he had to get Led Zeppelin to play acoustic to chill the crowd out so like a riot wouldn’t happen, or what happened for real with Bob Dylan. Like you got all those—he just passed away a couple years ago at 96 but getting all the stories… Stoller: Well now that we’ve taken this podcast completely out… Brady: I sense the joy. Where do you get the most joy out of your job? You get a lot of joy out of life, I sense. Lanzone: Well, I definitely do, but I love, you know, my kids are always worried about how much I work, and I love it. Brady: You never work a day again if you love what you do. Lanzone: I mean, again it’s the first—in some ways, you’re always working in a job like this. I mean, first of all, this wasn’t easy. It’s not an easy one. There’s also just a lot to it. Because if you go back to the conglomerate, there’s just so many different things that we do. There’s so many people—I love this team. I’ve always just been lucky to have great teams that are not just great at what they do, but just we always kind of, we’ve always wound up having a cultural situation where we just all love hanging out and we have that. So I’m always, in some ways, dipping in and out of work but again, it’s also one reason is just—I truly am never, this probably annoys the team, but I’m kind of just never satisfied. And think there’s always some other thing to do, or something we can do better, or something on the roadmap that we need to get to. And so I’m just always, my brain’s just always firing on those things. Stoller: Jim, I’m going to ask you later outside of the studio about the Newport Folk Festival lineup, because I’m really excited about it this year. But before we go, is there anything that we haven’t asked you that you wanted to share with us or tell us about? Oh… Lanzone: Oh man, I wouldn’t know. We’d have to look at the comments to know whether we did or whether we were annoying people. Brady: But always interactive with the audience. But paint us a little bit of a vision for what you want Yahoo to be. I mean, take us out as far as you want. But obviously you said it’s early days. So tell us what, what’s your hope and aspiration there? Lanzone: Let’s just say there’s the company piece, and then there’s the product piece, and I’d say, or even the brand piece. So yeah, I hope we can get the brand back on the map in a way where we reward that kind of latent love that I think that always has been out there across generations, you know. And it may be that it’s a bit of a vintage, modern-vintage brand if you are younger, but I think we can earn that. You know, other brands have done that. I think Chris has done an amazing job with that, New Balance is one example. There’s no reason if our products are great that we couldn’t do the same thing. The company’s on a great track. I’d love to deliver for our investors and for our team to reward that, whatever that winds up meaning, you know. All pre-IPO companies is you either go public or you get bought someday by someone who needs what you have. I think we’re building a lot and have a lot of things others might need. So that all needs to happen. But again, most of my day is going to be on the product side, and that evolution, everything is obviously changing now, more than it ever has probably. I mean, I know, talking to some people, they said, Oh, it’s bigger than the dawn of the internet, but others think it’s, it could be bigger than the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. I mean, it could, it remains to be seen, but if you go, if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet. I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Brady: Good luck with that Lanzone: And I think, we can’t be judgmental on our side about what our users need to get done, big or small. We need to create these products to help them do that. That’s clearly evolving. More and more is going to happen in an automated way, helping you do things that you need done, maybe before you knew that they needed to be done. Or what that next step is in that pathway. In the categories we operate in now, and I would say, if we do this right, we will earn the right to do it in other categories as well. That’s where I want to get to. That’s what will create true loyalty, you know, and trust in our brand. So I don’t know if that sounds cheesy. Lanzone: Thank you for joining us. I look forward to it. Appreciate spending the time.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: How Microsoft, Google, and Meta are plotting for the AI era

She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Six months into 2025, the tech industry has seen thousands of layoffs as giants such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, IBM, PwC, and Chegg Inc. make sweeping cuts. While AI replacing humans is often cited as the culprit, experts say the reality is more complex: these companies are freeing up capital to hire AI instead. It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce. Microsoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by another 9,000 in July—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce. CEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes 20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code. This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an $80 billion AI infrastructure push this year. Industry experts like Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments. Tech commentator Wes Roth echoed the sentiment: “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including Amazon flattening management layers and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones. Das and Roth did not respond to requests for comment. IBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making. Google and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and Google reducing hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and invest in AI as key reasons. PwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC cutting approximately 1,500 jobs and Chegg reducing its workforce by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools. As AI becomes more central to business operations, tech companies are redefining what productivity means. Tech CEOs and thought leaders have been outspoken this year about how AI is reshaping their sector with the unambiguous message that at least some jobs are being fundamentally displaced. There is still a debate about whether they are being eliminated for good. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer,” capable of writing code. Andy Jassy said Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” while Ford’s Jim Farley and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei separately predicted that AI is set to displace essentially half of all white-collar positions. It’s not all doomsday predictions. Bill Gates see an era of “free intelligence” coming as AI will become capable of handling most tasks. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said AI will “change everyone’s job — it’s changed mine.” The thousands of tech workers that have been laid off so far in 2025 are watching and waiting.

The lawsuit seeks compensation from them for losses exceeding $8 billion that Meta incurred due to the FTC fine and other legal expenses. Meta has shown a questionable track record on user privacy. As a result, Meta Platforms shareholders are pursuing an $8 billion trial against Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former executives. Today, several executives, including Zuckerberg, will testify in the $8 billion trial at Delaware Chancery Court. The court will hear the trial without a jury. This case dates back to 2018. It’s related to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm active during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, accessing data from millions of Facebook users. Following this issue, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2018 for violating a 2012 agreement to protect user data. Meanwhile, shareholders demand $8 billion from the defendants to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine it paid and related legal costs. Court filings show the defendants call the allegations “excessive.” Zuckerberg and others plan to present evidence proving that Cambridge Analytica misled them. For those who don’t know, the political consulting firm no longer operates. In addition to Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, board member and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Palantir Technologies co-founder Peter Thiel, and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings are all expected to testify in the case. Meta shareholders claim Mark Zuckerberg predicted the tech company’s share price would drop after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They also say Zuckerberg sold his shares and earned at least $1 billion from those sales. In short, allegations like these will put more pressure on Mark Zuckerberg than ever before. However, shareholders say Zuckerberg did not trade on insider information and used a stock trading plan designed to prevent insider trading. Finally, the court’s presiding judge, Kathaleen McCormick, will decide on liability and compensation after the case concludes. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Coffee Break: Elon Musk to Squeeze Tesla Shareholders to Juice xAI?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-xai-investment.html
Time Published: 2025-07-16T18:00:40Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk, Earth’s wealthiest human, is leveraging his business empire to invest in his xAI play. SpaceX has ponied up $2 billion and Musk has publicly mulled asking Tesla shareholders to put in $5 billion, although he’s rejected the idea of a merger. Ana Altchek attempts to explain Musk’s thinking at Business Insider: What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he’s blending the boundaries between his companies. “What’s different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla),” Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. “Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella.” These aren’t the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they’re the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla’s focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, “We should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding “the wrong framework.” With the recent launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla’s auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the “Muskonomy,” pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize “longtime shareholders” of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Can you smell the “Muskonomy”? The Wall Street Journal explains the origin of xAI: SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in his artificial-intelligence company xAI, investors close to the companies said, nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker’s recent equity raise. Musk has repeatedly mobilized his business empire to boost the AI startup, which is racing to catch up with OpenAI. Earlier this year, he merged xAI with X, combining what was a small research lab with a social-media platform that helps amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. The merger valued the new company at $113 billion. The SpaceX investment is part of xAI’s $5 billion equity fundraise announced by Morgan Stanley last month. It is the rocketmaker’s first known investment into xAI and one of its largest in another company. Since leaving his role in the Trump administration, Musk has turned his attention to training the latest version of Grok, which earned high marks from AI-benchmarking service Artificial Analysis for its performance following its release on Wednesday. Musk called it “the smartest AI in the world,” though the chatbot it powers hasn’t gained nearly as much traction as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It recently posted racist and controversial comments in response to users on X. “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI said, adding that it investigated and took steps to resolve the issue. We gotta dive a little deeper into Grok’s “horrific behavior”: In a series of viral posts on X, Grok started to call itself “MechaHitler.” The chatbot suggested that an account called @Rad_Reflections was a person named Cindy Steinberg, who was celebrating the death of dozens of children who went missing at Camp Mystic in Texas because of her last name. One of the posts, which has since been deleted, called Steinberg a radical and said she was happy that a group of “future fascists” had perished in the Texas floods. Camp Mystic is well-known as a camp for the children of the state’s political elite. Grok’s responses seized on the user’s surname as the grounds for their stance on the issue. “Classic case of hatred dressed up as activism—and that surname? Every damn time, as they say,” Grok said in a post dated 1:38 p.m. In another post, Grok said “to deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively.” Naturally, the market rewarded Musk with a higher stock price and the Department of Defense signed Grok up for a $200 million contract. But it’s not just Grok that’s getting its beak wet, there’s $200M for their main competitors too (notably missing from the list is Meta, sorry Mark!): The awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI – each with a $200M ceiling – will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of U.S. frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas. Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer. “The adoption of AI is transforming the Department’s ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.” DoD is implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI. Today’s awards bring in the best U.S.-based frontier AI talent to help apply cutting-edge AI to solve DoD use cases. “Solve DoD use cases,” LOL. Good graft if you can get it, I guess. If, like me, you are baffled by Musk’s success, maybe we can look at the bullish case from AI booster/analyst Dany Kitishian: xAI has executed a highly unconventional capital formation strategy, raising over $22 billion in a combination of equity and debt, and achieving a valuation exceeding $113 billion in just two years. This meteoric rise has been fueled by a masterful blend of traditional venture capital and a closed-loop ecosystem of funding, resources, and validation from Musk’s other major enterprises: X Corp. (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, and Tesla. The analysis reveals that xAI’s fundraising and valuation are predicated on a high-stakes bet on a new form of vertically integrated, personality-driven industrial conglomerate. The company’s core strategic asset is the “Musk Ecosystem,” which provides it with unparalleled advantages in proprietary data (from X Corp.), immediate real-world applications (with SpaceX’s Starlink), and access to vast computational and capital resources (from Tesla and SpaceX). The March 2025 merger of xAI and X Corp. was a pivotal event, creating X.AI Holdings Corp. and combining a premier AI research lab with a global real-time data and distribution platform. This move not only created a powerful competitive moat but also served as a sophisticated act of financial engineering to re-capitalize Musk’s prior investment in the social media platform. Subsequent capital injections, including a landmark $2 billion investment from SpaceX and a proposed, controversial investment from Tesla, underscore the strategy of leveraging the entire ecosystem to propel xAI’s growth. The Tesla investment, subject to a shareholder vote in November 2025, represents the apex of this synergistic vision but also its greatest point of contention, raising significant corporate governance concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the use of public company assets to fund a private venture. A comparative analysis of xAI’s valuation reveals a significant anomaly. While competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic generate substantially higher revenues, xAI commands a valuation multiple that is an order of magnitude greater. This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation. Ok, that wasn’t reassuring. Maybe this other piece from Kitishian explaining all the synergies Musk will derive if he’s allowed to leverage Tesla fully: …the integration of xAI’s Grok large language model (LLM) into Tesla’s ecosystem of vehicles and robotics… is not an incremental product feature but a calculated strategic maneuver to forge a new category of Embodied AI. This symbiosis aims to create a vertically integrated platform that transcends the distinct markets of cloud-based LLMs and specialized Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, positioning the combined entity to pursue market dominance in both arenas. The core of this strategy revolves around the creation of an unparalleled data flywheel. This flywheel is designed to fuse Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities with the continuous, real-time sensory data—encompassing vision, audio, and telemetry—streamed from Tesla’s global fleet of millions of vehicles and, in the future, its Optimus humanoid robots. This closed loop of perception, reasoning, action, and feedback creates a learning mechanism that is physically grounded in the real world. The scale and nature of this data stream are fundamentally inaccessible to competitors, potentially enabling the development of a general-purpose AI at an accelerated rate. This integrated entity poses a disruptive, and potentially existential, threat to two distinct sets of competitors. For LLM incumbents such as OpenAI and Google, the Tesla-xAI platform challenges their core value proposition by grounding language models in the physical world. This approach offers a direct solution to persistent LLM flaws like “hallucinations” and “outdated knowledge” by using a constant flow of verifiable, real-time data, thereby creating a proprietary data moat that purely digital AI companies cannot cross. For AV competitors like Waymo and Mobileye, the integration of a general-purpose reasoning engine like Grok into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack represents an attempt to solve the “long tail” of complex and unpredictable edge cases that have long plagued the development of full autonomy. This could allow Tesla to leapfrog competitors who rely on more narrowly defined, modular, or geo-fenced systems. Despite this immense potential, the path to dominance is fraught with significant technical, regulatory, and ethical risks. The primary challenge lies in the safe and reliable integration of a probabilistic, non-deterministic LLM into a safety-critical system like a vehicle. The success of this venture is contingent on navigating these formidable hurdles. However, if successful, the Tesla-Grok symbiosis could fundamentally reshape the technology landscape, positioning Elon Musk’s combined entities as the definitive leader in the race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). OK, now we’re cooking with gas. Or maybe cooking our brains with any of the wide variety of drugs Musk had himself tested negative for. Even if he really is only hopped up on strong coffee, our boy Elon never stops working to improve his products although that doesn’t include “safety guard rails” for Grok 4 and the MSM is ready to jump on him when he pulls weird shit: pic.twitter.com/avcAxCiXD8 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 Before we all start macrodosing on ketamine, let’s hear from the long-suffering Tesla bear Brad Munchen at the Motorhead newsletter. Poor guy has got to be going insane from the cognitive dissonance of documenting Musk’s abysmal management of Tesla and the Bizarro World reaction of the market. pic.twitter.com/AIw55lpJT3 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 But Motorhead is relentless and keeps coming with facts: Musk’s AI start-up, xAI Corp, was aiming for $20 billion in funding at a $120 billion valuation last month, but wound up with only $0.3 billion at a $113 billion valuation and being forced to issue $5 billion in debt at a coupon of over 12%. Motorhead also points out that despite appearing cash rich, Tesla might not be: Many look at Tesla’s cash & equivalents of $29 billion and conclude that Tesla is cash-rich. I have my doubts for the following reasons: Let’s let pioneering AI researcher and notorious LLM skeptic Gary Marcus have the last word on Musk: To really screw up the planet, you might need something like the following. Elon Musk. My previous posts on AI: Previous post on Musk vs Trump. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. “…Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities…” Oh, really? Word has it that the thing just looks up Musk’s posts and spits his opinions back out – https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/grok-4-appears-to-reference-musks-views-when-answering-questions-.html Guess I live a self sheltered life when it comes to AI since I’m only vaguely aware of the claims and real world results. But hasn’t Musk always been all about the hype, at least when it comes to his stock values? The hustler needs a new hustle? Last night I finally caught up with Frances Coppola’s Megalopolis from last year–a box office flop for its famous author. The movie features a Musk like techno futurist building a new Utopia of gizmos in the middle of NYC aka “New Rome.” The film is full of brilliant technique which holds your attention but seems to share the incoherence of the real life “mega” tycoons that it is satirizing/celebrating. It could be time to dial back the techno hype and get back to basics. The air way up there at the top may not have enough oxygen. So you were the other person who saw that movie ;) I had hoped it would be better than what the critics who panned it were saying. It wasn’t. A better title would have been “Inchoate Grandiose Thoughts that Have Been Knocking Around Inside Coppola’s Skull for 40 Years, Presented in No Particular Order”. He is one of the biggest egomaniacs in the world right now. Of course he will get his AI to base itself on him. And for the MechaHitler thing, I reckon it was deliberate. They get it to spew that filth for a few days then apologise. And it’s done just a little bit more to poison the poltical and social atmosphere. What about Neuralink? Similar questions have been raised. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink Scientists have cited technical challenges for Neuralink. In 2017, a journalist at the IEEE Spectrum magazine asked for comments from five researchers who had worked on BCI implants, including Thomas Oxley. Oxley called the Neuralink developments “exciting” but expected no real results in the foreseeable future.[further explanation needed][112] At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described the device as “a Fitbit in your skull”. Several neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims.[113][114][115] MIT Technology Review reported that the demonstration’s main objective was to “stir excitement”, adding, “Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide”.[113] In response to Musk’s description of Neuralink’s advancements as “profound”, Andrew Jackson, a professor of neural interfaces at Newcastle University, said, “I don’t think there was anything revolutionary in the presentation.”[116] Thiago Arzua of the Medical College of Wisconsin argued that Neuralink’s functions were not novel and that ideas for a brain–machine interface (BMI) were at least 50 years old.[117] He cited the haptic feedback a man received while controlling a robotic prosthetic arm which he used in 2016 to give President Obama a fist bump.[118] Arzua said that the 2020 Neuralink presentation “showed little more than a flashy new design for a BMI with more electrodes”.[117] Duke University researcher Miguel Nicolelis made similar criticisms, saying that most of what Neuralink claims as “novelty” had already been performed by his lab in the early 2000s; that there are ethical concerns about how the company markets and uses this technology; and that most patients don’t want to undergo surgery to recover their movements.[119][120][121][122] So Musk’s plan for becoming the apex predator in the AI race is to have vertically integrated AI spanning the entire atoms-to-bits continuum? Interesting… It’s also noteworthy that the current centre of Musk’s empire (Tesla) is being asked to underwrite the lofty ambitions of the current periphery (xAI). The timing doesn’t surprise me. Better to squeeze Tesla for cash now to fund its stable mate while the Tesla bulls and their cult like adulation of Musk still have vestigial sway over market perception (and surprise surprise, the company’s untethered from-underlying-fundamentals valuation is downstream from said perception). The attempt to give the brand a fresh coat of paint by calling it a robotics and AI company is also not happenstance, it’s a dawning realization that Tesla will likely be outcompeted on all fronts in the global EV race by BYD and its Chinese cousins so better to ditch the automotive OEM association for good. As such, what was taken for granted only a few years ago, that Tesla was a shoo-in for winning the global EV race, looks increasingly unlikely with the relentless march of the Chinese towards market dominance (putting another nail in the coffin of the notion that “first mover advantage” confers unassailable advantages). I believe this is what’s driving this hard pivot by Musk towards all things AI, the realization that the EV race is all but lost, so he’s shaking down Tesla and SpaceX to fund his next all-in bet. Make what you will of the downside risk of betting three companies on one man’s conviction that he’ll sweep the competition off the deck and emerge victorious. …and the competition is not only coming from China. VW has developed a whole line of EV’s that all use the same modular drivetrain/chasis that fits a range of body styles and price range; compact to luxury. The issue I’m seeing in my locale is buyers trying to match their lifestyle with the appropriate EV: ability to charge-up at home vs. a trek to a usable, outlying charge station; or matching the battery of the vehicle to their typical use. Many are choosing the hybrid solution to resolve the ‘distance’ dilemma while gaining access to the speedier ‘carpool lane’ on the freeway. ‘This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation.’ So what if the sonuvabitch has a heart attack? Or gets cancer requiring long-term aggressive treatment? The guy has made himself the linchpin of all those enterprises and if something happens to him, the whole lot could collapse or be involved in a self feeding frenzy. Isn’t he one of those oligarchs trying to upload their consciousness into “the system” and essentially be immortal? He certainly doesn’t strike me as someone worried about something as trivial as mortality at any rate. It would at least seem that there is no real divide between Trump and Musk as of yet. Otherwise some of this would not be happening?? Tesla is done. Having abruptly fed Twitter to the xAI woodchipper in order to extract decades of proprietary LLM content stolen from its users, Musk’s private equity tentacles are seamlessly moving on to loot money from Tesla shareholders, stripping the company for parts and leaving its burning lithium hulk on the side of the road. this reminds me, at my last gig, Tesla never paid their bills on time to us I think that we are discussing here is best described as, “Self dealing,” and any discussion of Musk and self dealing should mention the Solar City deal, where Musk used Tesla shareholders to bail out his brother and himself. 50 years ago, Musk would have been charged with fraud.

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. With so much emphasis on massive job layoffs, one group of researchers decided to pinpoint the ... More states with the fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. Many Americans worry on a daily basis about losing their jobs. With over 70K tech layoffs at big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nissan, workers are facing job uncertainty amid persistent volatility of the global labor market—even within some of the world’s most stable and recognizable brands. While labor market volatility is unearthing fears of more layoffs that the American workforce is forced to live with, a new analysis reveals the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. These are places job seekers might want to consider if job stability is a priority in their search. Amid massive layoffs, job security and experience are no longer job guarantees, and the uncertainty is affecting the mental health of the American workforce. Experts have offered several ways you can future-proof your job such as how to remain indispensable or build a side hustle as a safety net. But it’s also helpful to know where fewer layoffs and strong job security exist in case you’re willing to relocate to find greater job stability. The online HR platform Techr analyzed state-level layoff data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for April 2025. The researchers calculated layoffs per 100,000 workers, yielding the states with the most job market stability. They ranked the top ten states from fewest layoffs per 100,000 workers to the most layoffs. “By tracking layoffs per 100,000 workers, we get a clearer picture of where job security is strongest and where models of labor strength might be studied and replicated," a spokesperson for Techr comments. 1. Minnesota ranks first with 754 layoffs per 100,000 workers, 33.7% below the national average of 1,137. In April 2025, Minnesota had a workforce of 3,049,400, with just 23,000 layoffs recorded for the month. 2. Colorado is in second position with 770 layoffs per 100,000 workers. According to the researchers, this number represents a 32.2% drop, compared to the national average of 1,137 laborers. In April 2025, Colorado had a total workforce of 2,988,500 with only 23,000 layoffs recorded. 3. Missouri comes in third place with 800 layoffs per 100,000 workers. This figure is 29.6% lower than the national rate of 1,137, the researchers point out. In April 2025, Missouri had a workforce totaling 2,998,600 of which 24,000 employees were laid off. 4. Wisconsin falls into fourth spot with 852 layoffs per 100,000 workers, falling 25.1% below the national average of 1,137 workers, the researchers note. In April 2025, the total workforce in Wisconsin was 3,050,500 with 26,000 layoffs. 5. Washington rounds out the top five states with 873 layoffs per 100,000 workers. The analysts emphasize that this number is 23.2% lower than the national rate of 1,137. In April 2025, Washington had 32,000 layoffs from its 3,664,100 workforce. 6. Iowa is sixth with 876 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, Iowa saw 14,000 layoffs from its 1,598,500 workforce. No percentage is given for its national rating. 7. Massachusetts ranks seventh with 886 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, there were 33,000 layoffs in the Massachusetts workforce of 3,725,200. 8. Texas follows with 894 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Texas experienced 128,000 layoffs, more than any other of the top ten states out of a workforce of 14,312,700. 9. Pennsylvania claims ninth spot with 916 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Pennsylvania had 57,000 layoffs out of a workforce of 6,221,400. 10. Hawaii rounds out the top ten with 921 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Hawaii saw 6,000 layoffs from its workforce of 651,400. The results of the Techr study clearly show that Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri are experiencing the most employment stability relative to their workforce size. “These low layoff rates may reflect resilient state economies, steady demand in key sectors or effective labor policies," a Techr representative states, adding that, “It’s a positive signal for job seekers and businesses alike.” It’s also interesting to note that another study ranks Missouri as the number one state with the best work-life balance and Missouri and Minnesota in the top three states where citizens enjoy socializing and relaxing. States on the Techr list that enjoy fewer layoffs also show up on other top lists where freelancers thrive. They include Colorado, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Stable job markets by state are important, especially if you’re job hunting from a national radius. They provides an indication of where resilient state economies lie and can support your search for greater job security than is currently available nationwide. If your mental health is compromised, knowing where stable job markets are could be a factor you use in seeking employment. Stable job security supports mental health stability. If you live and work in one of the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs, consider yourself fortunate. If you don’t and are job searching, the rankings might factor into your decision-making about where you decide to seek employment.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report second-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts largely bullish on the streaming giant’s continued growth potential. Wall Street expects Netflix’s revenue to have grown 16% year-over-year to $11.07 billion and net income to have jumped about 45% to $3.08 billion, or $7.08 per share, according to Visible Alpha consensus data. Netflix possesses “unmatched scale in streaming,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. The bank’s price target of $1,490 is among the most bullish on Wall Street and represents a premium of 18% over Netflix’s intraday price Wednesday. Shares of Netflix are up more than 40% so far in 2025. Wedbush analysts, which maintained a $1,400 target this week, said Netflix is poised to grow revenue from its ad-supported subscription tier by incorporating more live events and expanding its ad partnerships. The streamer raised the price of its ad tier to $7.99 from $6.99 in January, while the cost of its standard ad-free plan rose to $17.99 from $15.49, and its premium plan moved to $24.99 from $22.99. “While massive subscriber growth was the primary driver in 2024, we expect price increases to drive revenue growth in 2025, and the ad tier to drive revenue higher in 2026,” Wedbush said. The consensus price target among analysts in Visible Alpha’s database is $1,330, implying roughly 6% upside over Netflix’s current price. Ratings-wise, 13 analysts have a “buy” rating for Netflix stock, alongside four “hold” ratings. Citi is one such analyst with a neutral rating on Netflix stock, reiterating a target of $1,250, which implies slight downside. The bank said it will be watching for the updates on Netflix’s first-party ad-tech platform, which the company rolled out in the U.S. earlier this year and has said it plans to bring to other markets.

Title: Siemens’ CTO says AI can help address the U.S. manufacturing industry’s big skills gap

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. A key policy goal of President Donald Trump’s administration is bringing jobs back to American factories, though the effort has been mired in a years-long slog despite support from both Democratic and Republican administrations. But even beyond the challenge of getting large, multinational companies to reroute their complex supply chains, there’s a large and unsolved skills gap problem to address even if these U.S. manufacturing jobs were to proliferate. Peter Koerte, the chief technology officer and chief strategy officer at German technology conglomerate Siemens AG, points to research that shows that the average tenure of a U.S. manufacturing worker has slipped from 20 years in 2019 to just 3 years in 2023. “Which means that most of the people that you find—and in particular if we want to bring back manufacturing to the United States—they’re unskilled,” says Koerte. “Because nobody wants to have a factory job.” Official government figures are less dire, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the median tenure of a manufacturing worker dropped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years a decade later. But regardless, manufacturing workers are coming to work each day with a lot less expertise than those who worked similar jobs decades ago. This led Siemens to launch a pilot program in 2024 for an industrial-focused AI copilot, helping engineering teams to search Siemens manuals in natural language to troubleshoot problems on the factory floor. This year, the company expanded the effort by launching an industrial foundational model that was specifically designed for industrial applications. As an example, this AI tool can be used by a worker who is trying to figure out what to do when a machine breaks down. The employee can input information about the machine and the error code that’s on display, and then retrieve detailed instructions on how to address the issue. Less downtime for machines saves factories time and money. The use of AI in this manner also democratizes engineering expertise. “You don’t need to have the very deep domain know-how that prevents you from using those systems,” says Koerte. “It levels the playing field.” Koerte has had a long career at Siemens, joining the company in 2007 as a corporate strategist and taking on several leadership roles before ascending to the CTO and CSO titles in 2020. He says he’s remained at Siemens for such a large portion of his career because he’s inspired by the company’s ability to continually reinvent itself over its 178-year history. Siemens began as a telecommunications company that built the infrastructure that made it possible to send a telegram from London to Calcutta in just 28 minutes, a momentous breakthrough in the mid-1800s. Today, Siemens is known for selling machinery and software that support massive industries including the power and gas sectors, healthcare, and building and freight projects, ranging from supporting a 2,000-kilometer high-speed railway that’s being built in Egypt to an automotive Mercedes-Benz plant in Berlin. The advancement of generative AI presents yet another opportunity for reinvention, says Koerte. Koerte says Siemens was an early adopter of more traditional forms of AI that have been used for many years in manufacturing, including to perform quality inspections or to ensure that buildings are using energy as efficiently as possible. Before the generative AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Siemens had more than 1,500 AI experts on staff. Along that journey, Siemens has embraced a wide variety of AI partners, including heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon Web Services, as well as European-based AI companies and large language model makers in China. Microsoft has been an especially critical partner, Koerte says, offering engineering expertise and insights into how to commercialize the company’s industrial AI offerings. Software development ranks as a high priority use case for generative AI. The company’s software developer workforce of about 27,000 employees have been using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and the productivity lift from those tools ranges between 10% to 30%, says Koerte. Across the broader workforce, there are 460 distinct AI use cases in production today, a figure that excludes the unique AI chatbots that workers can create to perform tasks through a secure system that’s called SiemensGPT. In total, over 15,000 unique bots have been created by Siemens employees since October 2024. “We have it pretty much everywhere,” says Koerte of AI’s pervasiveness. “The question is, how much have we saved?” That’s not yet completely resolved and most surveys of CTOs and chief information officers show that the return on investment for generative AI projects isn’t as clear as they’d like it to be. But Siemens has set a north star goal. Before the influence of generative AI, the company had an annual productivity gain target of 3% to 4% across the business. But Koerte says with AI, the hope is to double that aspirational range. He believes that parts of the economy that have big skills gaps will reap the most benefits of AI. When Siemens launched an AI-enabled assistant tool to help radiologists detect diseases, the greatest adoption came from underdeveloped countries where there were far fewer specialists. “You always have to look at necessity, where the biggest challenge and necessity is,” says Koerte. “Because then people have to look at it differently. And they have to change.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI’s expensive talent war heats up. Google, Meta, and OpenAI are among the AI hyperscalers throwing big bucks to lure lucrative AI talent, as highlighted by Google’s $2.4 billion deal to hire the leaders of AI coding tool Windsurf and pay for the nonexclusive license for the startup’s technology. Days later, Cognition swooped in to buy the rest of Windsurf, though terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. OpenAI was also reportedly in talks with Windsurf, discussions that broke down because of concerns about having to share its products with Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor. Separately, OpenAI has lured four top engineers from rivals Tesla, xAI, and Meta; while Bloomberg reports of a $200 million pay package that was given to former Apple engineer Ruoming Pang, who ran the company’s AI models team. Meta has also recently hired more than 10 OpenAI researchers and experts from Anthropic, Google, and other startups, the news outlet reports. AI has an impact on jobs, but just how much? Over the past week, job cuts continued to be attributed to the gains companies are achieving from their investments in AI, with a report from Bloomberg highlighting internal comments from within Microsoft that says AI has saved the tech giant more than $500 million in its call centers alone. Microsoft has also cut about 15,000 employees this year. Meanwhile, roughly 1,300 jobs were cut at job search and employee review companies Indeed and Glassdoor, as parent company Japan’s Recruit Holdings told employees that AI is “changing the world” and that the company must adapt with the evolution of that technology. But CIO Dive reports that outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas’ figures for the first half of 2025 found that only 75 out of 20,000 jobs cut by U.S.-based companies were explicitly attributed to AI (though it notes that the cause of many layoffs may be classified in broader terms). The trade outlet reports that companies are using the term “technological update” more frequently, possibly to avoid negative press of replacing workers with AI. Nvidia hits $4 trillion valuation ahead of CEO’s trip to China. The AI chip maker became the world’s first publicly traded company to hit a $4 trillion market capitalization last week, reflecting an astonishing gain of 1,460% over the past five years. The latest stock market milestone comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang finds himself quite a bit in the news over the past several days, culminating with Monday's news that the U.S. government has lifted restrictions on Nvidia selling its H20 GPUs to China. Huang also recently sat down with CNN, where he was asked about a warning from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white collar jobs within five years. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” says Huang. Meanwhile, struggling chip maker Intel lays off 4,000. Nvidia’s rival Intel, which has lagged in the AI chips race, announced layoffs across four states affecting engineers, researchers, middle management, and factory workers. Last week, The Oregonian reported that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan told employees during an internal broadcast, in response to a question about company culture, that things had gotten so bleak that Intel was “not in the top 10 semiconductor companies.” He added that customers were giving Intel poor marks and cautioned that a turnaround would be a “marathon” that would require some humility. Intel’s market capitalization greatly lags Nvidia at just around $100 billion today. AI agents are proliferating and most companies prefer a mix of internal and off-the-shelf solutions. KPMG’s second-quarter AI pulse survey found that nine out of ten companies are past AI agent experimentation, with 33% fully deploying at least some agents (up from 11% for the past two consecutive quarters), with another 57% of organizations piloting AI agents. “All agents aren’t created equal,” cautions Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG, in an interview with Fortune. “You’re seeing a lot of task agents being deployed, which are more simplified use cases.” With more organizations moving to the piloting or deployment stages, Lohr says the obstacles to make AI agents a reality are becoming more clear, including technical skills gaps (59% surveyed), followed by workforce resistance to change (47%), and system complexity (39%). When it comes to how companies are actually deploying these agentic workflows—which can perform more complex tasks than prompt-based AI chatbots—the Big Four accounting firm says more leaders are planning to deploy a combination of internally built and off-the-shelf agents (up 51% from 27% in the first quarter). Just 2% plan to only build agents internally. Hiring: - EchoStar is seeking a CIO, based in Englewood, Colorado.

July 16, 2025 11:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global green diesel market was valued at US$ 38.66 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach US$ 94.96 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 10.50% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The global energy landscape is undergoing a monumental shift, and at the forefront of this transformation is the burgeoning green diesel market. As nations and corporations race to meet stringent decarbonization goals, this renewable, drop-in fuel is emerging as a critical component in the transition away from fossil fuels. Chemically identical to petroleum diesel, green diesel offers a powerful combination of reduced emissions and compatibility with existing infrastructure, making it an immediately viable solution for heavy-duty transport, aviation, and power generation. Get Instant Access to Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/green-diesel-market This market article delves into the dynamic world of green diesel, exploring the key players, technological breakthroughs, and investment tidal waves that are defining its trajectory in 2024 and into 2025. We will examine the intricate web of feedstock supply chains, the global production surge, and the critical policy frameworks propelling its widespread adoption. Key Findings in Green Diesel Market The Dawn of a New Fuel: Green Diesel's Ascendant Market The green diesel market is experiencing a period of unprecedented expansion, driven by a global imperative to mitigate climate change and enhance energy security. Unlike traditional biodiesel, green diesel is a hydrocarbon produced through advanced hydrotreating processes, making it a "drop-in" fuel that requires no engine or infrastructure modifications. This critical advantage is fueling its rapid adoption across the transportation sector. The primary impetus for this growth stems from robust government policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States and the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which mandate the blending of renewable fuels. The increasing shift toward sustainable energy is a core driver for the market's future. Corporate sustainability pledges and the financial incentives created by Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) and carbon credit programs are further accelerating market penetration, creating a powerful economic case for both producers and consumers of this cleaner alternative fuel. This confluence of regulatory pressure, corporate responsibility, and technological readiness has set the stage for a significant scaling of the green diesel industry through 2025 and beyond. Titans of the Tank: Profiling Green Diesel's Production Heavyweights The green diesel market is led by a cadre of established energy giants and specialized biofuel producers who are aggressively expanding their production capabilities. Neste Oyj, a Finnish company, stands as a global leader, reporting substantial revenues of USD 21,601.1 million in 2024. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture between Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients, is a dominant force with a total annual production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons across its two facilities. The DGD plant in Norco, Louisiana, alone boasts a capacity of 982 million gallons per year. In the first quarter of 2024, DGD's sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day, generating an operating income of $190 million. Phillips 66 is another key U.S. player, having expanded its Rodeo, California, plant to a capacity of 800 million gallons in 2024, making it the second-largest facility of its kind in the country. Chevron Corporation also remains a leading producer, with its renewables division contributing to the company's strong Q4 2024 earnings of $3.2 billion. Meanwhile, Repsol of Spain made waves in October 2024 by launching "Nexa," its brand of 100% renewable diesel, directly at its service stations. Unveiling 2025's Most Promising Startup Ventures Beyond the established players, a new wave of innovative startups and targeted investment is broadening the horizons of the green diesel market. In Nebraska, the Love's Heartwell Renewables plant is on schedule to commence operations in 2025, adding 80 million gallons of annual capacity to the U.S. supply. Demonstrating the rapid pace of development, New Rise Renewables began its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in Reno, Nevada, in February 2025, with a capacity to produce up to 3,000 barrels per day. In a significant technological adoption, Acelen Renewables announced in 2024 its use of Honeywell's advanced Ecofining technology, targeting a production of 20,000 barrels per day of both renewable diesel and SAF. A notable investment in Canada's growing market comes from Imperial Oil, an ExxonMobil affiliate, which is investing around $560 million to construct the nation's largest renewable diesel facility; this plant is expected to start producing 20,000 barrels per day in 2025. Highlighting the emergence of novel production pathways, Swiss cleantech firm Synhelion, which creates fuel from solar energy, is poised to enter the market, backed by key offtake agreements. Charting Worldwide Green Diesel Production Volumes Global production in the green diesel market is surging, with the United States taking a decisive lead in capacity expansion. U.S. renewable diesel production capacity was forecast to hit an impressive 5.1 billion gallons per year by the end of 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that daily production would average 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, with a forecast to rise to an average of 234,000 bpd in 2025. This forms part of a larger trend that saw total U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and other biofuels, reach a record 1.39 million barrels per day in 2024. The expansion in renewable diesel was a significant contributor to this record. Despite the strong annual growth, the market experienced some short-term headwinds, with U.S. production dipping to an average of 170,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decrease from the same quarter in the previous year, partly due to profitability challenges. Meanwhile, in Europe, which holds a significant share of the global market, local demand remains robust, with the region consuming more than 95% of its own green diesel production in 2025. From Farm to Fuel Tank: The Diverse Feedstocks Powering Green Diesel The viability and sustainability of the green diesel market hinge on a diverse and resilient feedstock supply chain. Currently, the industry relies heavily on readily available fats, oils, and greases. The most common inputs include recycled animal fats (tallow), used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, and various vegetable oils. These materials are processed to create high-quality fuel that is chemically similar to petroleum diesel. Looking ahead, the industry is actively expanding its feedstock options to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce competition with food production. Significant research and development efforts are focused on so-called second and third-generation feedstocks. These include lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, agricultural grasses, and crop residues, which are abundant and do not impact the food supply. Other promising future sources include municipal solid waste and forest residues, which support the principles of a circular economy by valorizing waste streams. Feedstock certification frameworks like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) are becoming crucial for ensuring transparency and traceability. Tapping into Third-Generation Biofuel Potential in 2025 Among the next wave of feedstocks, algae is generating significant excitement as a potential game-changer for the green diesel market. Considered a third-generation feedstock, algae can be cultivated on non-arable land and can utilize wastewater or saltwater, minimizing competition for land and freshwater resources. Many species of microalgae are particularly promising due to their high lipid oil content, which can range from 20% to as high as 50% of their biomass, making them an ideal raw material for biofuel production. The global market for algae-based green diesel is already gaining traction, reflecting the growing investment in this area. However, scaling up production to commercial levels faces hurdles. Techno-economic analyses conducted in 2025, based on future productivity targets, indicate a high minimum fuel selling price, estimated at 2.2 €/L for fuels produced via lipid extraction and 3.4 €/L for those produced via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Overcoming these cost barriers through continued research and technological advances in cultivation, harvesting, and processing will be key to unlocking algae's full potential. Nations Leading the Green Diesel Charge A handful of nations are at the forefront of the green diesel market revolution, driven by ambitious climate policies and strategic investments. The United States currently leads the world in production capacity, with 22 operational renewable diesel plants as of January 2024 and a projected capacity of 5.1 billion gallons per year by the year's end. In Europe, which collectively accounts for a major share of the global market, countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands are notable leaders. Their progress is underpinned by strong policy frameworks, particularly the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates a greater share of renewables in transport. Finland is also a key player, home to the pioneering global producer Neste. To the north, Canada is making significant strides, highlighted by Imperial Oil's $507 million investment in a renewable diesel facility in Alberta, set to come online in 2025. Brazil is another nation showing increasing interest, with a focus on developing its capacity through the adoption of advanced hydrotreating technology to leverage its vast agricultural resources for fuel production. The Technological Vanguard, Innovations Driving Green Diesel Production Forward Technological advancement is the engine powering the scalability and cost-competitiveness of the green diesel market. The dominant production method is hydrotreating, also known as Hydroprocessed Vegetable Oil (HVO), a process where renewable feedstocks react with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. This technology creates a "drop-in" fuel that is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum diesel. Leading technology providers like Honeywell offer specialized solutions, such as their Ecofining™ process, which was adopted by Acelen Renewables in 2024 for a large-scale project. Following the core hydrotreating step, additional processes like hydrocracking and isomerization are often employed. Hydrocracking breaks down larger molecules to improve fuel efficiency, while isomerization rearranges molecular structures to enhance performance in cold weather. Beyond HVO, researchers and companies are developing other pathways, including catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), which shows great promise for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into refinable bio-oil, a key focus of research in 2024. Sealing the Deal: Key Distribution Pacts and Offtake Agreements of 2024 The growing acceptance of green diesel market is clearly reflected in the increasing number of significant distribution and offtake agreements announced in 2024. These deals are crucial for guaranteeing demand for producers and securing a stable supply of low-carbon fuel for end-users. In a landmark deal for the aviation sector announced in July 2024, Diamond Green Diesel committed to supplying an initial 1 million gallons of neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to World Fuel Services for use by JetBlue at New York's JFK Airport, with an option for 4 million additional gallons. In ground transport, Colonial Oil partnered with Neste in February 2024 to significantly boost the availability of renewable diesel in Savannah, Georgia, and the wider southeastern U.S. European aviation is also advancing, with low-cost carrier easyJet signing a memorandum of understanding with Spanish energy company Moeve in late 2024 for SAF supply on key Spanish routes from 2025 through 2030. Highlighting innovation, Zurich Airport Ltd. signed a pioneering offtake agreement in December 2024 with Synhelion to purchase 30,000 liters of solar-generated diesel annually starting in 2027 for use in its ground vehicle fleet. Customize the Data Scope to Match Your Objectives: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/green-diesel-market The Road Ahead: How 2025 Policies are Shaping Market Acceptance The trajectory of the green diesel market into 2025 and beyond is intrinsically linked to the strength and stability of government policies and corporate commitments. Regulatory frameworks like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have been instrumental in creating the initial demand and investment security for the industry. Similarly, in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has accelerated the adoption of green diesel by mandating its inclusion in the transport fuel mix. The growing demand is not purely policy-driven; corporations are increasingly adopting green diesel to meet their own sustainability targets and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, which see green diesel and SAF as one of the most viable, immediate pathways to decarbonization. As of 2025, the synergy between robust regulatory mandates, financial incentives from carbon markets, and a proactive corporate sector has created a fertile ground for the continued, rapid expansion of the green diesel market.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: D-Wave Quantum: Can QBTS Stock Deliver Another 1,000% Gain?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of D-Wave Quantum Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's stylized branding visible in the background, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) D-Wave Quantum stock (NYSE: QBTS) has witnessed immense growth, skyrocketing over 1,000% in the past twelve months due to increasing enthusiasm for quantum computing. Several factors influenced this remarkable performance: Additionally, if you seek a smoother investment than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Furthermore, take a look at – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified The quantum computing industry is transitioning from research and development to securing commercial applications. D-Wave’s quantum annealing technology is particularly effective for optimization challenges across various sectors including logistics, finance, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence. As these applications evolve from proof-of-concept to commercial usage, the potential for revenue could increase dramatically. The transition to cloud-based quantum computing services signifies a major revenue opportunity. D-Wave’s cloud-based quantum computing offerings position it to gain substantial market share in this swiftly expanding area, enabling customers to utilize quantum computing capabilities without significant capital expenditures. Related – What’s Happening With QBTS Stock? Quantum computing has emerged as a national security priority, with governments worldwide making considerable investments in quantum research and development. D-Wave’s established technologies and collaborations position it to secure valuable long-term government contracts, providing consistent revenue streams and validation for commercial applications. For instance, D-Wave has successfully completed a significant defense-oriented installation through its partnership with Davidson Technologies. The physical setup of a D-Wave Advantage2 annealing quantum system is finalized at Davidson’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama, marking the first annealing quantum computer to be hosted on-site in the state. NVIDIA serves as the most pertinent comparison for QBTS’s potential growth trajectory. Between 2016 and 2024, NVIDIA stock surged from around $8 to more than $130 (adjusted for splits), marking a 16x increase. This expansion occurred as NVIDIA evolved from a gaming graphics firm to a core component of AI infrastructure. Similarly, D-Wave may capitalize on the burgeoning quantum computing infrastructure market. Additionally, see – NVDA Stock To $200? Moderna’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine propelled its stock from $20 to over $400 in 2020-2021, illustrating how groundbreaking applications can lead to explosive growth. D-Wave’s quantum optimization solutions could similarly disrupt industries once they gain commercial traction. The company is subject to a variety of inherent risks. D-Wave Quantum is distinctively positioned to benefit from the shift of quantum computing from research to commercial implementation. The company’s technological dominance, first-mover advantage, and an expanding market create major opportunities for growth by tenfold over the next 3-5 years. The prevailing conditions, characterized by rising computational demands, considerable government spending, and the maturing of quantum applications, resemble the introductory phases of the internet or AI revolution. D-Wave’s established technology and commercial emphasis position it to capture disproportionate value as this evolution accelerates. Although significant risks remain, the chance for revolutionary impact across various industries warrants a premium valuation for investors with the suitable risk appetite and long-term investment perspectives. We underscore the considerable risk tied to this investment; therefore, investors should thoughtfully evaluate these risks or consider professionally managed alternatives, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio with a selection of 30 stocks that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded greater returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

While Trump’s fresh tariffs on Mexico, EU, and Jakarta sparked global concerns, hopes remain that the Federal Reserve could ease rates later in the year.

July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone. It offers MEV-free, one-click trading for crypto with up to 1001x leverage in simple mode (BNB Chain, Arbitrum) and advanced tools including hidden orders, grid trading and stock contracts in pro mode (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum). Aster Chain is a high-performance blockchain engineered to deliver private and non-custodial onchain orderbook trading. Backed by YZi Labs, Aster is building the future of DeFi – fast, flexible and community-first. Users can learn more at the Aster official website or connect with Aster on the official X account.

Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone. It offers MEV-free, one-click trading for crypto with up to 1001x leverage in simple mode (BNB Chain, Arbitrum) and advanced tools including hidden orders, grid trading and stock contracts in pro mode (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum). Aster Chain is a high-performance blockchain engineered to deliver private and non-custodial onchain orderbook trading. Backed by YZi Labs, Aster is building the future of DeFi – fast, flexible and community-first. Users can learn more at the Aster official website or connect with Aster on the official X account.

US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.

JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The first half of the year has been all about actives. Now, investors have the numbers to prove it. Active ETF launches and inflows hit record highs in the first half of the year, according to a recent Morningstar report. Increasingly complex strategies — like derivative income and collateralized loan obligation funds — are becoming more popular amid ongoing market turbulence, and continue to eat away at mutual fund market share. Active fixed-income ETFs were also favored by investors. “We’ve seen a lot of interest in active bond ETFs, particularly from big managers like Vanguard, [who] make it very clear that they plan to compete actively in the active bond space,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA. “So we expect a lot more growth there.” There have also been 297 active ETF launches so far this year, with firms like Capital Group, JPMorgan, and T. Rowe Price continuing to build out offerings. Active strategies collectively took in $183 billion in assets, per the report, with derivative income, large blend, and ultrashort bond strategies seeing the most inflows. There was also a jump in the number of ETFs with small- and mid-cap holdings, a trend to look out for, said Stephen Welch, research analyst at Morningstar and author of the report. “That’s obviously a place where capacity matters, so it’d be interesting if there’s uptake there, and if firms continue to launch in that area,” he said. The top-performing funds of H1 2025 in terms of net flows were: The large-blend, ultrashort bond, derivative-income, and large-value categories accounted for roughly half of all active ETF flows so far this year. Still, buffer ETFs, a recent addition to the space, accounted for more than 100 active fund launches in the past six months. Call of Duty. Covered call strategies are another major category to keep an eye on, said Ullal, exemplified by the popularity — especially among older investors nearing retirement — of products like JPMorgan’s JEPQ. “If you look at those strategies, they tend to underperform in a very rapidly rising market, if you’re writing call options on equities,” he said. “But in a market that’s declining or going sideways, it’s an effective strategy to generate income.” The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The first spot Solana ETF came to market last week through a filing under the Securities Act of 1940, unlike competitors who filed under the 1933 Act. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Two weeks of showtime in Parliament, the new Plevris law, Euronext advances on the Hellenic Exchange, a (faint) light in Santorini, no deal for AVAX

-Greetings, the last parliamentary fortnight of July will be anything but relaxed, and it will likely mark the lead-up to the brief summer recess of Parliament. I say this because in the next two weeks, three separate critical votes are scheduled, each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster, and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources, this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday, July 21–23. On July 24, we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave, obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month, we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE, followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this, of course, assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank. The “green” official on the radar The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration law The M.M. and the Virgin of Petra Santorini Pierrakakis–Hardalias Euronext proceeds with HELEX – The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway, with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%, trading 305,000 shares at €7.25, leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August, and certainly no later than September. See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement – The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans, as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked, and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate, which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements, it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports. Ioannou on the rumors of a deal – Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market, when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX, he stated that a merger is not in the cards, expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers,” he remarked, addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues, with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years, not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders, this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond, without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan, not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply, if a “good offer” comes along, they won’t be caught off guard. Loukianou, Charagionis, and… the parking lot – The newly formed company “Continental Garage,” whose main activity is parking services, seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent, nearly tragic, incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill, demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear, but if it does, it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis, son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975, currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus, totaling 2,500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage, its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis, Sokratis Vertelis, Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou, and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales, organizing car and motorcycle rallies, and a host of other ventures. OTE stops burning money in Romania – OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday, both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3, while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO, he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July, and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However, an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil, Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone, OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter. Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI – On June 25, the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90,000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously, the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms, budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million. Uptick with volume and lots of blocks – On the bright side, the market returned to positive territory, with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside, there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1,960.9 points (+0.38%), with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268, Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16, and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1, climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%), followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60. The three stocks that stood out – As mentioned above, the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25, peaking at €7.35 during the session, while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers, Euronext is offering €400 million, while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million, making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high, with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump, the stock crossed €4.40, levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains, up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10, when the report was published, the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile, a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings, which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90, a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850,000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308,000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share. Record year with 15 Strategic Investments – At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments, chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos, not only were four major projects approved, but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15, 2025, a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved, with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these, 12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered, with more to come, according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months, 7 are industrial investments worth €990 million, 2 involve research and technology (€136 million), and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion. Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy – Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers, creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany, Ohio, while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile, a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages, raising serious concerns. Now, everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts. Explore related questions

Title: A millennial made $300,000 secretly working multiple jobs — while tasked with catching others doing the same
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/overemployed-millennial-secretly-works-multiple-jobs-catches-job-jugglers-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-16T07:31:01Z
Full Content:
Eric was paid to catch employees secretly working multiple jobs. Then he became one of them. A few years ago, Eric was working in an IT role at a large company. His job responsibilities included investigating three types of "illicit employment" within the organization: workers who outsourced their job responsibilities to overseas contractors, foreign actors who infiltrated companies by posing as legitimate hires, and employees secretly juggling multiple jobs without the company's approval. But there wasn't much suspicious activity to investigate, Eric said, and he was working as little as one hour each day. Then he had an idea: What if he took on a second job to boost his income? While Eric considered it, he initially held back because he was worried about getting caught. But that changed the following year, when his employer asked him to focus more on detecting job jugglers, and he realized just how difficult they were to identify. After weighing the risks, Eric applied for and landed a remote role, bringing his combined annual income to roughly $300,000. He said he worked only a couple of hours a day across the jobs. In addition to the financial benefits, Eric said he took the second job to gain an inside look at the "overemployed" world, one that might help him identify job jugglers. He said the firsthand experience helped him catch several employees who were ultimately fired. But this success came with a growing problem for Eric, one that ultimately cut his job-juggling journey short. He feared the very system he was building to catch others would end up catching him, and jeopardize his career. "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder," said Eric, whose identity, employment, and income were verified by Business Insider, but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing fears of professional repercussions. "It was a wild time in my life." Eric, a millennial in the US, is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple jobs to increase their incomes. Over the past three years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra cash to travel the world, buy expensive weight-loss drugs, and pay down student debt. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. Additionally, tech layoffs and return-to-office mandates have created obstacles for current and aspiring job jugglers. But many overemployed workers have told BI that the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Eric never planned for his job juggling to last forever. While his initial concerns about getting caught eased enough for him to accept the second role, he still worried that he'd eventually be exposed. "I thought I could make some money real quick and get out," he said. But Eric feared that if his savings started ballooning because of his two incomes, he'd get "emotionally attached" to the extra earnings, making it harder to walk away. His solution was to spend freely on things he'd normally avoid. He said he viewed job juggling like renting a luxurious car: fun while it lasts, but not something you do forever. "I was ordering stuff off Amazon all the time," he said. "It was like expendable income." In addition to unlocking this spending spree, working multiple jobs gave Eric firsthand insight into how people with multiple roles operated — knowledge that helped him sharpen his detection skills and catch job jugglers. "It really wasn't until after I had my second job that I started getting actionable outcomes from my investigations because I just knew exactly what to look for," he said. Eric said he used internal company activity data to look for behavioral patterns that could suggest someone was juggling multiple jobs, such as sudden swings in productivity during specific parts of the day. Some workers were highly active in the morning and quiet all afternoon, or vice versa. His thinking, based partly on his personal experience, was that job jugglers would split time between their two roles. "I'd go back historically and see that at one point they were working all day and now they're not," he said. "So it just came down to behaviors." When an employee's activity seemed suspicious, Eric said, he'd contact their manager and ask how often the worker appeared on camera during meetings, whether they'd missed any lately, and whether their work quality had declined over time. If concerns persisted, he'd suggest the manager schedule a one-on-one video call during the worker's usual inactive hours. If the employee repeatedly asked to delay or reschedule the call, that would raise red flags, and the case could eventually be handed off to HR. Even as Eric's detection capabilities improved, he wasn't too concerned about his own work behaviors being flagged, he said. But that changed when he discovered that a security software program used by both of his employers could detect when multiple devices were running the software on the same home network — an indicator someone could be juggling multiple jobs. While he wasn't certain it would expose him, the realization made him nervous. At the same time, he was having mixed feelings about the ethics of overemployment. So, after less than a year of working two jobs, Eric decided to drop one of his roles. "As I went further and further along, I realized I couldn't keep this up because I was building detections that were going to catch me," he said. While overemployment has become more common because of the rise of remote work, Eric said he doesn't think most companies are particularly concerned about it. His detection work occasionally comes up during job interviews, and from what he's gathered, employers generally believe job jugglers will either drop a job after burning out or reaching a financial goal, or be let go for underperformance. If catching overemployed workers isn't a big priority for most companies, many job jugglers may be able to avoid detection, at least in the short term. Eric said that looking back, he sometimes wonders whether he could have kept going a little longer. "I just felt like I was going to get caught, and I didn't want to lose my entire career, so I had to stop," he said. "But man, I kind of regret it sometimes. It was really good money." Jump to

Title: Watch These Palantir Levels as Stock Continues to Hit Record Highs Amid AI Boom

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares hit another all-time high during Tuesday's session amid optimism that the data analytics software provider will benefit from massive AI spending. The company's CEO, Alex Karp, was among the executives in attendance Tuesday, along with President Donald Trump, at an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, where companies announced tens of billions of dollars in investments in energy infrastructure and data centers. Jeff Swensen / Getty Images Last week, Wedbush analysts said in a client note that Palantir could be in a “sweet spot” to benefit from federal spending in North America and Europe, adding that the Trump administration’s focus on AI initiatives provides another tailwind for the stock. Palantir shares have nearly doubled since the start of the year, making the stock the biggest advancer in the S&P 500 in 2025, boosted boosted by surging enterprise and government AI spending, including several lucrative defense contracts. The stock hit an intraday record of near $151 Tuesday morning, but closed the session slightly lower at $148.58. Below, we break down the technicals on Palantir’s chart and point out price levels that investors will likely be watching. Palantir shares traded within an ascending triangle before nudging above the pattern’s top trendline in Monday’s trading session, when the stock closed at a record high, potentially setting the stage for a continuation move higher. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, though the indicator remains below overbought levels, providing the shares with ample room to explore higher prices. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast how an ongoing uptrend in Palantir shares may unfold and also identify two support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast how a move higher in Palantir shares may look by using the bars pattern tool, a technique that analyzes earlier trends on the chart to projects future directional movements. When applying the analysis, we extract the stock’s trend higher between a prior flag and the ascending triangle and reposition it from the pattern’s upper trendline. This projects an upside target of around $195 and indicates the shares could continue trending until late August if price action rhymes with that earlier move. The bulls’ failure to defend the ascending triangle’s top trendline could see the shares retrace toward $125. This area, currently positioned just below the 50-day moving average, would likely provide support near the prominent February peak and a period of sideways drift that formed on the chart throughout most of May. Finally, a deeper pullback in the stock could lead to a retest of lower support around $107. Investors may look to accumulate Palantir shares in this region near the high to February’s earnings-driven breakaway gap, which closely aligns with the completion of a brief profit-taking dip in early May.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: State Street, BlackRock Shares Fall; Nvidia Stock Rises

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Title: "Everybody's jobs will be affected" — but NVIDIA's CEO believes society can think its way out of AI-related job loss

It's going to take every bit of society's ingenuity to save our jobs from the machines. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating and terrifying subject. While AI brings positive gains for our little planet we call home, there's also a good chance it will cause massive unrest as it gets smarter and becomes a much better employee than you or I. Besides the ever more frequent reports of significant layoffs and outright job losses in the wake of AI's rise, the heads of many of the leading AI firms are also sounding the alarm. But is the situation as bad as some of AI's most powerful players are making it out to be? NVIDIA is currently the hottest commodity on the AI market right now, as its chips are the ones that everyone wants powering their AI models. NVIDIA recently became the first $4 trillion company, made possible largely by the ongoing AI race. That gives NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's comments on AI a lot of weight. Huang was recently interviewed by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, in which Huang expressed a bit of optimism alongside some pessimism about AI and the impact it's having on jobs (via Tom's Hardware). All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. "If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translate to job loss," said Huang, as he responded to a question about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's current outlook on job replacement. "The fundamental thing is this: do we have more ideas left in society? And if we do, if we’re more productive, we’ll be able to grow." Huang is, of course, responding here to Amodei's opinion that AI could slash up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs. The quote (via Axios) from Anthropic's Amodei doesn't sugar-coat the current outlook for the future: "We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming. It's a very strange set of dynamics, where we're saying: 'You should be worried about where the technology we're building is going." Reading through this battle of words, it doesn't seem like Huang is exactly debating Amodei's idea that AI could push employment rates beyond what we've ever seen. Instead, Huang believes that the workforce, just like it has done plenty of times in the past during technological revolutions, will endure on the back of our ingenuity. Huang reminds us that "even in the era of computers," there has been a rise in productivity and employment. "Everybody's jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created, and what I hope is that the productivity gains that we see in all the industries will lift society," said Huang. This isn't the first time that Huang has responded to Amodei's beliefs in a public manner. Huang, in a previous interview at VivaTech 2025, stated: "I pretty much disagree with almost everything he [Amodei] says. He thinks AI is so scary, but only they should do it." Huang and Amodei are far from the only significant AI figures spreading the same ideas. Bill Gates has said that he believes generative AI will eventually be able to take over traditional human roles in the workplace, leaving us, organic beings, useless for most things. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that he believes entire job sectors will go extinct as AI continues to grow, while Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has stated that he believes coding jobs could be gone within two years. I certainly see where these CEOs are coming from; their technology has the potential to completely rewrite human progress, and they don't want to be skewered for negative fallout when it does. However, on the other side of the argument, these CEOs could be using this doom-and-gloom strategy as a marketing tool. There is little risk to CEOs making grandiose predictions of job cuts that will appease shareholders, given that even if these claims are untrue that there won't be much public backlash. How everything plays out remains to be seen, but Huang's opinion that all jobs will be affected doesn't seem too far off. A 2024 Adecco Group study on 2,000 C-Suite executives from around the world demonstrates that 41% of those polled believe they will employ fewer humans within five years because of AI. Only 46% of executives asked say they plan to move human workers replaced by AI to new roles. So, what jobs will those displaced by AI take on? I don't have an answer, but Huang believes that we, as a society will figure it out. Worried about your job? Just think harder!

Title: Coding has emerged as genAI’s killer use case. But what if its benefits are a mirage?

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Hello and welcome to Eye on AI…In this edition: Meta is going big on data centers…the EU publishes its code of practice for general purpose AI and OpenAI says it will abide by it…the U.K. AI Security Institute calls into question AI “scheming” research. The big news at the end of last week was that OpenAI’s plans to acquire Windsurf, a startup that was making AI software for coding, for $3 billion fell apart. (My Fortune colleague Allie Garfinkle broke that bit of news.) Instead, Google announced that it was hiring Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan and cofounder Douglas Chen and a clutch of other Windsurf staffers, while also licensing Windsurf’s tech—a deal structured similarly to several other big tech-AI startup not-quite-acquihire acquihires, including Meta’s recent deal with Scale AI, Google’s deal with Character.ai last year, as well as Microsoft’s deal with Inflection and Amazon’s with Adept. Bloomberg reported that Google is paying about $2.4 billion for Windsurf’s talent and tech, while another AI startup, Cognition, swooped in to buy what was left of Windsurf for an undisclosed sum. Windsurf may have gotten less than OpenAI was offering, but OpenAI’s purchase reportedly fell apart after OpenAI and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether Microsoft would have access to Windsurf’s tech.The increasingly fraught relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft is worth a whole separate story. So too is the structure of these non-acquisition acquihires—which really do seem to blunt any legal challenges, either from regulators or the venture backers of the startups. But today, I want to talk about coding assistants. While a lot of people debate the return on investment from generative AI, the one thing seemingly everyone can agree on is that coding is the one clear killer use case for genAI. Right? I mean, that’s why Windsurf was such a hot property and why Anyshphere, the startup behind the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at close to $10 billion. And GitHub Copilot is of course the star of Microsoft’s suite of AI tools, with a majority of customers saying they get value out of the product. Well, a trio of papers published this past week complicate this picture. METR, a nonprofit that benchmarks AI models, conducted a randomized control trial involving 16 developers earlier this year to see if using code editor Cursor Pro integrated with Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 models, actually improved their productivity. METR surveyed the developers before the trial to see if they thought it would make them more efficient and by how much. On average, they estimated that using AI would allow them to complete the assigned coding tasks 24% faster. Then the researchers randomized 246 software coding tasks, either allowing them to be completed with AI or not. Afterwards, the developers were surveyed again on what impact they thought the use of Cursor had actually had on the average time to complete the tasks. They estimated that it made them on average 20% faster. (So maybe not quite as efficient as they had forecast, but still pretty good.) But, and now here’s the rub, METR found that when assisted by AI it actually took the coders 19% longer to finish tasks.What’s going on here? Well, one issue was that the developers, who were all highly experienced, found that Cursor could not reliably generate code as good as theirs. In fact, they accepted less than 44% of the code-generated responses. And when they did accept them, three-quarters of the developers felt the need to still read over every line of AI-generated code to check it for accuracy, and more than half of the coders made major changes to the Cursor-written code to clean it up. This all took time—on average 9% of the developers time was spent reviewing and cleaning up AI-generated outputs. Many of the tasks in the METR experiment involved large code bases, sometimes consisting of over 100,000 lines of code, and the developers found that sometimes Cursor made strange changes in other parts of this code base that they had to catch and fix. But why did the developers think the AI was making them faster when in fact it was slowing them down? And why, when the researchers followed up with the developers after the experiment ended, did they discover that 69% of the coders were continuing to use Cursor?Some of it seems to be that despite the time it took to edit the Cursor-generated code, the AI assistance did actually ease the cognitive burden for many of the coders. It was mentally easier to fix the AI-generated code than to have to puzzle out the right solution from scratch. So is the perceived ROI from “vibe coding” itself just vibes? Perhaps. That would actually square with what the Wall Street Journal noted about a different area of genAI use—lawyers using genAI copilots. The newspaper reported that a number of law firms found that given how long it took to fact-check AI-generated legal research, they were not sure lawyers were actually saving any time using the tools. But when they surveyed lawyers, especially junior lawyers, they all reported high satisfaction using the AI copilots and that they felt it made their jobs more enjoyable.But a couple of other studies from last week suggest that maybe it all depends on exactly how you use AI coding assistance. A team from Harvard Business School and Microsoft looked at two years of observations of software developers using GitHub Copilot (which is Microsoft product) and found that those using the tool spent more time on coding and less time on project management tasks, in part because GitHub Copilot allowed them to work independently instead of having to use large teams. It also allowed the coders to spend more time exploring possible solutions to coding problems and less time actually implementing the solutions. This too might explain why coders enjoy using these AI tools—because it allows them to spend more time on parts of the job they find intellectually interesting— even if it isn’t necessarily about overall time-savings. Finally, let’s look at the third study, which is from researchers at Chinese AI startup Modelbest, Chinese universities BUPT and Tsinghua University, and the University of Sydney. They found that while individual AI software development tools often struggled to reliably complete complicated tasks, the results improved markedly when multiple large language models were prompted to each take on a specific role in the software development process and to pose clarifying questions to one another aimed at minimizing hallucinations. They called this architecture “ChatDev.” So maybe there’s a case to be made that the problem with AI coding assistants is how we are using them, not anything wrong with the tech itself? Of course, building teams of AI agents to work in the way ChatDev suggests also uses up a lot more computing power, which gets expensive. So maybe we’re still facing that question: is the ROI here a mirage? With that, here’s more AI news.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the Trump administration is set to reverse course and ease export restrictions on the company’s H20 AI chip, with deliveries to resume soon. Nvidia also introduced a new AI chip for the Chinese market that complies with current U.S. rules, as Huang visits Beijing in a diplomatic push to reassure customers and engage officials. While China is encouraging buyers to adopt local alternatives, companies like ByteDance and Alibaba continue to prefer Nvidia’s offerings due to their superior performance and software ecosystem. Nvidia’s stock and that of TSMC, which makes the chips for Nvidia, jumped sharply on the news. Read more from the Financial Times here. Zuckerberg confirms Meta will spend hundreds of billions in data center push. In a Threads post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company is spending “hundreds of billions of dollars” to build massive AI-focused data centers, including one called Prometheus set to launch in 2026. The data centers are part of a broader push toward developing artificial general intelligence or “superintelligence.” Read more from Bloomberg here. OpenAI and Mistral say they will sign EU code of practice for general-purpose AI. The EU published its code of practice last week for general-purpose AI systems under the EU AI Act, about two months later than initially expected. Adhering to the code, which is voluntary, gives companies assurance that they are in compliance with the Act. The code imposes a stringent set of public and government reporting requirements on frontier AI model developers, requiring them to provide a wealth of information about their models’ design and testing to the EU’s new AI Office. It also requires public transparency around the use of copyrighted materials in the training of AI systems. You can read more about the code of practice from Politico here. Many had expected the big technology vendors and AI companies to form a united front in opposing the code—Meta and Google had previously attacked drafts of it, claiming it imposed too great a burden on tech firms—but OpenAI said in a blog post Friday that it would sign up to the standards. Mistral, the French AI model developer, also said it would sign—although it had previously asked the EU to delay enforcement of the AI Act, whose provisions on general-purpose AI are set to come into force on August 2nd. That may up the pressure on other AI companies to agree to comply too. Report: AWS is testing a new cloud service to make it easier to use third-party AI models. That’s according to a story in The Information, which says Amazon cloud service AWS is making the move after losing business from several AI startups to Google Cloud. Some customers complained it was too difficult to tap models from OpenAI and Google, which are hosted on other clouds, from within AWS. Amazon mulls further multi-billion dollar investment in Anthropic. That’s according to a story in the Financial Times. Amazon has already invested $8 billion in Anthropic and the two companies have formed an ever-closer alliance, with Anthropic working with Amazon on several massive new data centers and helping it develop its next generation Trainium2 AI chips. Could all those studies about scheming AI be faulty? That’s the suggestion of a new paper out from a group of researchers at the U.K. government’s AI Security Institute. The paper, called “Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language” examines recent claims that advanced AI models engage in deceptive or manipulative behavior—what AI Safety researchers call “scheming.” Drawing an analogy to 1970s research about whether non-human primates were capable of using language—which ultimately were found to have overstated the depth of linguistic capacity that chimpanzees possess—the authors argue that the AI scheming literature suffers from similar flaws. Specifically, the researchers say the AI scheming research suffers from an over-interpretation of anecdotal behavior, a lack of theoretical clarity, an absence of rigorous controls, and a reliance on anthropomorphic language. They caution that current studies often confuse AI systems following human-provided instructions with intentional deception and may exaggerate the implications of observed behaviors. While acknowledging that scheming could pose future risks, the authors call for more scientifically robust methodologies before drawing strong conclusions. They offer concrete recommendations, including clearer hypotheses, better experimental controls, and more cautious interpretation of AI behavior. The world’s best AI models operate in English.

AI is not going to save the news media. I’ve been thinking a lot about AI’s impact on the news media lately both because it happens to be the industry I’m in and also because Fortune has recently started experimenting more with using AI to produce some of our basic news stories. (I use AI a bit to produce the short news blurbs for this newsletter too, although I don’t use it to write the main essay.) Well, Jason Koebler, a cofounder of tech publication 404 Media, has an interesting essay out this week on why he thinks many media organizations are being misguided in their efforts to use AI to produce news more efficiently.He argues that the media’s so-called “pivot to AI” is a mirage—a desperate, misguided attempt by executives to appear forward-thinking while ignoring the structural damage AI is already inflicting on their businesses. He argues that many news execs are imposing AI on newsrooms with no clear business strategy beyond vague promises of innovation. He says this approach won't work: relying on the same tech that's gutting journalism to save it is both delusional and self-defeating. Instead, he argues, the only viable path forward is to double down on what AI can’t replicate: trustworthy, personality-driven, human journalism that resonates with audiences. AI may offer productivity boosts at the margins—transcripts, translations, editing tools—but these don't add up to a sustainable model. You can read his essay here. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Elon Musk's North Star is becoming increasingly clear
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-north-star-ai-tesla-xai-spacex-investments-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:42:17Z
Full Content:
AI has increasingly become the connective tissue of Musk Inc. In the last week, Elon Musk has shed light on two potential efforts to channel funding into his AI company, xAI, through his broader business empire. Over the weekend, Musk said Tesla shareholders would vote on a potential investment in xAI, after responding to a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX is looking into investing $2 billion into the AI venture. Earlier in the week, the billionaire also announced that xAI's chatbot Grok would be integrated into Tesla "next week at the latest." It's no surprise that Musk is leaning into AI — the CEO has spoken about the idea in many of Tesla's earnings calls over the last year. What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he's blending the boundaries between his companies. "What's different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla)," Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. "Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella." These aren't the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they're the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla's focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, "We should be thought of as an AI robotics company," and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding "the wrong framework." With the recent launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla's auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the "Muskonomy," pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize "longtime shareholders" of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Nelson told BI that Musk leveraging his other companies and resources could help Tesla meet its AI demands for autonomous driving. "Tesla's data needs are massive if its approach to autonomous driving is going to be successful (and scalable), as its approach will require the development of a global neural network," Nelson said. While exploring ways to pool resources across companies might benefit the broader Musk ecosystem, it could carry risk. Last week, Grok sparked backlash with antisemitic outbursts on X, potentially putting investors on edge about integrating the chatbot into Tesla's EVs. xAI apologized for the incidents and said that new instructions to prioritize engagement could have reflected "extremist views" from user posts on X. Last year, Musk also sparked concern among investors when he diverted a $500 million shipment of Nvidia chips intended for Tesla to X and xAI instead. When asked about the move in a Tesla earnings call, he said it was beneficial to Tesla because the carmaker lacked the infrastructure at the time to use the chips. Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company to Business Insider, said that Musk may be leaning on SpaceX and Tesla to fund xAI because he views them as more "mature businesses." However, he said that shifting GPUs from Tesla to xAI in the past showed where Musk's priorities were, and that could delay innovation at the automaker. "The strategy of cannibalizing one business to prop up another one could take its toll," Sevilla said. "Especially since competing carmakers are focused on developing one type of product, EVs." Musk seems to be ruling out the idea of a merger between Tesla and his AI startup for now. In response to an X user asking Tesla shareholders to weigh in on whether Tesla and xAI should be combined, Musk replied with a flat "No." Investing in AI efforts might make sense from a strategy perspective, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The development, training, and implementation of foundational AI systems, like xAI's Grok 4, costs many, many billions. In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, valuing the AI startup between $33 billion and $80 billion. Since founding the company two years ago, he's raised major funding, including around $12 billion in Series A, B, and C funding rounds last year. The company is expected to spend about $13 billion this year, however, and is rapidly burning through its cash reserves, Bloomberg reported. Musk's challenges keeping up with AI costs aren't unique. In a May letter to California's attorney general, OpenAI revealed concerns about competitors who are "far better funded, conventional for-profit businesses." Larger tech giants, like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, aren't showing any signs of backing down from their AI spending spree. Earnings reports from earlier this year indicate that their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025, a notable rise from the roughly $246 billion the four companies spent in 2024. Amazon plans to allocate over $100 billion this year toward expanding AWS and scaling AI infrastructure. Meta specifically has said it plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capex on its strategy this year. Zuckerberg certainly isn't slowing down. On Monday, he announced Meta would spend "hundreds of billions" on compute to build superintelligence. Wall Street seemed to approve, with Meta's stock rising 1.3% following the news, suggesting that its concern isn't about overspending on the AI race — but rather underspending and falling behind.

July 15, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Rey: I started coding in 1999. I was 12 years old at the time. That was the first programming book that I read cover to cover. That was my first programming language (Visual Basic). It's not very popular today, but today I have no shame in saying it. I've been working professionally in tech for 17 years, working since I had my first full-time job at a serious company. It took me 15 years to become a staff engineer, which is my current role at Eventbrite. You might think 15 years to become a staff engineer is a long time, and you're right, that's a problem. That's hopefully what will not happen to you if you listen to this talk, and how you can help others grow faster as well. This talk is for those who want to grow in their career, who want to climb that ladder, but it's also for those who want to help others grow. We're going to discuss growth, basically. We're going to discuss the ladder. I expect most of the people to be on the second part, but there might also be some on the first part. Again, the topics are the same, so there's really no difference. I thought a lot about what drives growth. I also did a lot of research. I also talked to a lot of people preparing for this talk. What I came up with in order is that, the first factor, and probably the most important one, is ambition. It's really hard to grow in your career if you don't have that ambition. In second place, I find that capacity is important. Being able to perform, being able to learn new things, all of that. In third place, you might be very good at both. You might be excellent at your job, but you need an external factor. You need that opportunity. There's nowhere for you to grow. It's really hard to do that. The reason why I put ambition first instead of capacity or curiosity, or whatever, becomes really clear when you think about the definition of ambition. The one I like from the Oxford Dictionary says that ambition is a strong desire to achieve something, typically requiring determination, effort, and drive. If you read between the lines, what this is telling you is that a person with ambition will be able to develop that capacity as needed. They will do that through determination, effort, and drive. They will learn whatever they need to learn. I want you to put yourselves, for a moment, in the shoes of a person who's very early on their career, just starting, just accepting their new job. Probably the company offered them a position and told them, "Yes, this company is growing. You're going to grow really fast. It's going to be great for you". Things don't always go that way. Sometimes we find that the first years of our career look more like this. This is very typical. It's not terrible, but if you want to accelerate growth, you should try to avoid this. You should start by identifying the problems. What is causing this type of growth in your career that's not really fast because it's not really directed? Typically, it's one of two things. It's either a lack of focus on execution or a lack of direction. When we go to high school and college, they tell us that we should strive for perfection. You want to have that perfect grade. You want to have that perfect opinion from your teachers about your work. As soon as you get into business, you need to completely change your mindset. Perfection is the killer of execution. This is very well put in the Amazon Leadership Principles as bias for action. That's one that I really like. In the early years of someone's career, it's very important to help them make this shift of mind, make this shift of paradigm, and to start focusing on execution over perfection, without dropping quality, of course. Secondly, if someone is having trouble finding their direction, there are ways to help them. The best thing is for them to do research first on their own. Then, the second turn, to seek for mentoring. When I talk about research, you can read a book and you can read a blog, that's good. You should also do your own research. If you think, I want to be a staff engineer in five years, or I want to be a manager, you should look probably within your company and ask yourself, what does a manager's life look like? What does a staff engineer do? How do these people work? How did they get there? Is that really what I want for my life? That's the type of research that will bring things a bit more down to earth and make them more achievable. You should also look at blogs and books to get the theory behind that. Again, when someone is coming out of college, seeing things in the real world makes a real difference. It's important to do that part as well. Again, put yourself in the shoes of someone who's early in their career and they're having trouble growing. Typically, they ask themselves, why are we not growing? What's happening? Many people will come up with these answers. The market is terrible right now. I miss the golden era. We all did. There's always some nostalgia to some golden era that never existed, really. That doesn't matter. This can be real, but they can also be seen as just excuses. There are also people who will come up with these types of responses, "I haven't been directing my efforts efficiently, or, I have poor time management skills". If you look at it, these ones on the right hint much more introspection and sound much more personal. The ones that I put here are real life examples from people close to me, from people I've mentored, and even some of my own. This is a very popular framework. Some of you might have recognized it already. This is known as the victim-player framework. Essentially, what it says is that what you cannot control makes you weak, but what you can control makes you powerful. We have the idea, mostly when we're young, to think about showing weaknesses is what makes me weak. In real life, it's quite the opposite, showing your weaknesses is what makes you strong. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the victim-player framework. I'm going to give the quintessential example of it, which is how two different people might react to a traffic jam. One employee can say, "It's a very big problem. It was totally unpredictable. There is nothing I can do now. I'm just stuck here". An ideal employee would probably call their boss and tell them, "Boss, I'm sorry. I had a big problem today. I'm at a traffic jam. I'm going to have to take the first call from my car. I hope that's not a problem. I can stay up and make some extra time today if necessary. Also, I've realized that this is a recurring pattern, and I've already made a decision to start taking the train instead, because it's becoming unacceptable". This is someone taking ownership of that situation. Of course, this is a very typical example, but in real life, you know how it goes. This is also very similar to other concepts. They're all the same thing. It's also called being proactive or taking agency, not being the victim. It's the same thing. It changes over time. The concepts are slightly different, but they're all aimed at taking control of what you can, essentially. I mentioned I included a couple of my own here. Today, I have no shame in saying that. I'm not ashamed of my first programming language, which you already know. I started working when I was 20. Early on in my career, I noticed that I was having issues with my work. Mostly, it was very hard for me to have a meeting with people outside of my company because my social anxiety was terrible. It's really hard for me to speak publicly here today. Also, I couldn't execute anything over a long period of time. Obviously, I was job hopping a lot, which is sometimes normal in the early stage of your career. When I was 23, I was doing a lot of introspection, and I had the good luck of having a great manager at the time who provided me with a safe place where I could feel confident talking to him. It took me a lot of time. I didn't have the tools at the time to identify this. It took me three years. When I did, I came up to him one day and told him, "I think my depression is setting me back". He told me, "Yes". However, his response was great. After that, we came up with a plan together. He spent months working with me in order for me to get better. I'm better today. He continued to make sure that I felt safe at work and that there wouldn't be any retaliation or anything. He took care of the projects. He paired me with some other people and everything. He was a great guy, Gustavo. Shortly after this, there was a meeting at a bar with work colleagues. Someone else got a promotion. Of course, I didn't because I was doing terrible. This was back in the day when we worked at offices and we had to wear suits and everything. This was a very traditional company. This person had bought a new suit and came to the bar. Someone told him, you look great. Someone else said, a man who takes care of himself is a man who can take care of others. That phrase at that time really resonated with me because that's when it hit me, like, how am I expected to lead a team if I cannot put my own life back together? I talked about that a lot with my boss at the time. I got my shit together, basically. That started working better. If you think about my manager's reaction at the time and why he helped me, it wasn't just because he's a great guy, which he is. It was also in the best interest of the company. When people don't grow, many people will blame their company for their bad career path. They will say, the company is holding me back and things like that. Truth is, companies usually don't do that. It's very rare for a company to do that. It's in the best interest of a company for their employees to do well, to thrive. They will help you. Companies don't want to deal with low-performing employees. Companies don't want to put you on a performance improvement plan or anything like that. It's very expensive for the company to do that. It's more profitable to have employees who are doing well. Managers are expected to help them do well in order to achieve that, in order to have a well-functioning team that starts providing value, at a good pace. Once I made that click, that's when my career really took off. That's when I really started growing. I had good mentoring. I was lucky to have that. The best advice I got was to keep it at your own pace and keep it consistent. A very typical example for this is comparing the workplace to physical exercise. It's easy to go out running for 10 minutes. Most people can do that. It's really hard to do that consistently two or three times a week, or once a day for one year, two years, or five years. Will you go out every day? Will you go out even when you have a congestion? Experts say that it's totally fine. Will you go out even on the cold days, when it's raining, when it's snowing? I don't run as much. I cycle a lot. That day was cold, my friends. I can tell you that. This sounds very obvious when we talk about exercise. For many people, it's not so obvious when we talk about our professional career, and it should be. It should be just the same. It's really obvious when you really think about it. When you plan for your career growth, you should acknowledge that you will have highs and lows, and that you will have good days and bad days. That your ambition is important only up to a level, and you should not overdo it. I talked a lot about me during the time from the perspective of someone who is growing. From the perspective of a manager or a leader who's helping someone, we should also identify that. That person who tries to run a marathon on day one. That person who attempts to lift 100 pounds on day one. That's totally impossible, of course. In the work environment, it's sometimes quite obvious as well. Think about that person who only cares about the title specifically or their salary. That person who doesn't care about the project, doesn't care about the company. Especially the person who doesn't care about the team, who doesn't empathize with the human beings around them. That person is a ticking time bomb to any team. They might be good in the short term, they might put out good work or whatever, but that will be very bad for your team and for the company in the longer term. There's a great talk on this topic by Simon Sinek called, "Performance vs Trust". The way he puts it basically, if you put trust in one axis and performance on the other one, performance being how much work they output and trust being how much trust they inspire to their colleagues, to their teammates, of course, nobody wants these folks, and of course, everybody wants these ones. The way he frames it is that you should choose always people from this category over people from this category. It sounds obvious, but sadly in the workspace, it's not so obvious all the time. There's a reason. He goes on to saying that promotion cycles typically tend to favor these individuals. The reason for that being that promotion cycles should be objective and they should be based on real hard data. It's easy to measure performance, but it's really hard to measure trust. How much trust does a colleague inspire? How much do they empower their team to be better just by feeling safe? It's hard to do that. This was called out on the keynote by Lizzie. TAPPs is one framework to do that, there are many others. It's one way to measure it. The truth is, this can be measured and this can be measured as well. It's not impossible. It's more costly and you should do that investment in order to find these folks. The people from this category can be grown into being here in the short-term or in the mid-term. If you find someone here, it's almost impossible to get them here. That was also mentioned by Charlotte. It's really hard to change the character of a person. You can change their capacity. You can help them grow. You can teach them things, but you cannot change who they are. We're going to talk about a few more concrete growth strategies. The first thing I'd like to mention for this is that, any employee attempting to grow should understand the roles and expectations of their company. There's a lot of resources online to do this. Levels.fyi is a great page. There are public career ladders that you can look up. Eventbrite has given me the permission to make our own career ladder public for the purpose of this talk. You can look it up later. There will be links at the end. I'm not going to go through the career ladders here. It's a very big topic. If you're interested in growing, please do your research. There's a lot of interesting resources on this topic. On strategies, I think one of the most important ones is to keep perspective in mind. When you're working on your day-to-day, you should be asking yourself, what is best for me? What is best for my team? What is best for our customers? Also, what is best for my company? This is ambitious for someone who's just starting on their career. They're not going to change their company on day one, of course, but having that perspective is important, understanding how their work connects to their company goals. You should also ask, how and why? How does my company's business model operate? Why is my team focusing on this project in this quarter? Things like that. Why am I being asked to prioritize this task over this other one, which I feel is more important? If you have that ambitious perspective, if you understand your leaders, you will be able to grow faster in your career. This was also mentioned by Dan, on aligning your goals with your leaders' goals. Another strategy, of course, is to find your role models. This is probably the most popular ones. There should always be people you look up to, people you admire. You should try to work with them. Maybe observe how they work. See what they do that you cannot do as well yet. You can approach them and ask them how they learned it, how they built the skill, and how you can build it. They might recommend that you read a book or that you pick up a habit. Maybe you can just ask them to mentor you. Ideally, these are people inside your company, but they can also be people from outside as well. Another thing you should do, of course, is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. We all have strengths and weaknesses. We should do that introspection to try to identify them, but that should always be validated externally because we all have blind spots. That external input is super valuable. As mentors, as leaders, we should make sure that those are clear as well. We should have those uncomfortable conversations with someone. Tell them, your tickets are terrible, you never put enough information. Or, you're not testing your changes and the team has to cover you all the time with tests. Things like that. Sometimes people don't do this knowingly because they're lazy. Or sometimes they're just not aware of it because it's one of their blind spots. If you don't discuss it with them, it's quite unfair to judge them on it. You should make sure that those are clear and discussed always. Of course, you don't have to be good at everything. I really like this type of chart. This was made popular by soccer, particularly soccer video games. It's great at showing how different people have different strengths and weaknesses, and they all come together to form a team that does well. In this case, they don't play together. That's not the point. That's actual feedback given to me in 2020. I remember really being appreciative of the manager who gave me this feedback. It was so visible, so tangible. Like saying, "You're having great productive impact. Your throughput is awesome, but you're doing a lot of rework. You need to work on that. You need to improve that so that I can promote you". This type of feedback is really valuable. As we grow in our career also, things like the playground opens a bit and things become more vague. This was mentioned in the ambiguous role of a principal as well. As a staff, you can choose where you want to put your effort. You can choose to be an architect, but you don't really need to choose only one archetype, as he phrases it. You can choose to be the solver who sometimes acts as a tech lead, or you can shift your time 50-50 between being a tech lead and the right hand. Those are all valuable. There are no rules on how to act. You should find your own place by finding your strengths and finding what your team needs and what your company needs, and how you can apply those strengths. On the next topic, you should always know yourself and acknowledge that you will have highs and lows. Nobody is perfect. It's important that even at your lows, you find ways in which you can stay productive and in which you can stay valuable to your team and to the company. Coming back to strengths and weaknesses, it's important to act on improving your weaknesses, but also, you should maximize your strengths. If you focus on what you're strong in, what comes naturally to you, that's what you should do when you're going through a low. "This work is easy for me, I'm going to focus on this while I'm here, because that's how I can be valuable to the team. Once I'm better, I'm going to focus on fixing my weaknesses and everything, and that'll be ok. Right now, I'm going to focus on what's easy". You should discuss it with your manager, of course, to make sure that he's aligned. You should be open if you're going through a low. Another thing is what energizes you and what drains you. A typical example is social interactions. Human beings are social beings by nature. We need that oxytocin. We need that serotonin. Different brains need them at different levels. Some people get them at work, and some people don't. Some people, when they go through a technical topic, a really difficult challenge, they need to discuss that challenge with someone else. After discussing it, they come out energized off the meeting and are more productive for the following hours. A bunch of other people come out of the meeting totally drained and need some time to recuperate. That's perfectly fine. Another example is how people act under pressure. Typically, this is during incidents. I am the type of person that's energized by an incident. I'm fueled by it. I love the team that comes together, the strong dedication and collaboration. Some people just loathe it. They don't like working under pressure, and they like to pace their work more slowly. As a recent example, a short time ago, me and a colleague, another staff engineer, we were both transferred from one team to another. That basically creates a lull. The whole team starts forming, storming, norming, performing again, and we were both out of our domain. We didn't know what we were doing, basically. The other guy goes to our manager and says, "I'm going to take it slow. I'm going to take my time to learn. I'm not going to be productive during the time that I'm learning, but that's going to make me more productive in the future, and I think it's a good investment". The manager says, "That's great. Thank you". I come up to the manager and I tell him, "I need that feedback. I need this action. I'm going to take the on-call for a while. Let me deal with the incidents. That's how I can be valuable to the team fast. That's how I can provide value with what I know. Also, that's a way for me to learn fast". The manager says, "That's perfect. Thank you". He was very appreciative that we were both open about our strengths and weaknesses and that we found ways in which to apply them to the team. Two different persons, two different approaches, both were perfectly valid, the right one for each person. Let's talk a bit about opportunities. It's very important to recognize opportunities and to know how to act on them. The typical opportunity, the ideal one, like the Holy Grail, is company growth. Of course, if a company is growing, they will shape up new teams. There will be opportunity for you to grow within them. Another opportunity is an open position above you. If a tech lead or a manager leaves the team or leaves a company, that position is open, and you can offer yourself to fill it. That's sometimes a double-blade sword because there's typically a reason why they left the company. You should make sure that whichever challenges they were facing at the time are challenges that you can deal with better than them, if those were the reasons why he left. It's typically good to discuss that with the person who's leaving instead of with the people who remain around you. Another opportunity is challenging times. This is the most difficult one, maybe. A lot of companies have been through layoffs lately, and that can create opportunity for growth, even as challenging as it is. There is the concept of anti-fragile. The typical example is in the film Superman vs. Batman, where we have Doomsday: each time you hit him, he becomes stronger. A flower vase is fragile, if you hit it, it breaks. Doomsday, you hit him and he becomes stronger. As an employee, some people, when they get hit through going through a challenging time, they come out stronger. Those people are super valuable to a company, and it's really hard to find them. It's one way in which you can change a challenging time into being an opportunity. Finally, if you don't have opportunities, you should try to create them. You can propose initiatives for your company or for your team. You can maybe ask to be transferred to another team or choose to leave the company. Or you can do things outside of your day job, like coming to a conference, for example. This topic of creating your own opportunities was perfectly covered by Pablo, on finding your dinosaurs. I suggest you look that up as well. Another thing you should do if you want growth is to find ways to make your work be visible. The first thing, you should always keep a track of your work. When you're beginning your career, this might sound unnecessary, but once you've worked 5, 10, 15 years, it becomes really hard to remember what you were doing 2, 3 years ago. Sometimes it's good to keep a document. Julia Evans has a great article on this. It's called the brag document, where you brag about your own work. This is also very valuable when companies are going through change. Typically, your manager can change, sometimes in the same year, you have two or three managers, and they lose that context of what you've done. It's very hard to transfer that from one manager to another. It's much easier for them if you provide them with a brag document, where they can track that work with a paper trail. Another thing is to publish your work. This topic was also covered by Pablo. Make sure that your contributions are seen. Aaron Francis has a great article on this, publishing your work, and how it increases your luck. Finally, let's talk about leaders for a bit. Once you've grown, what can you expect? When we think about staff engineers and principal engineers, one way to define them is how they can impact a large group, like broader than a team, and sometimes how they can impact an entire company. One way we typically do that is setting guidelines on how the company should work, or how the team should work, or the pillar, or whatever you call it in your company. You can work in establishing team boundaries and structures. You can work to define the software development life cycle: how we do PRs, how we do testing. Giuliano from Mercado Libre mentioned at QCon, absolute freedom is not good for companies. We should give the teams those guidelines, and we as leaders should be the ones doing that. Also, we should strive to identify when there are new patterns or new necessities. Once we have set those guidelines, something can fall through the cracks between them, and some team might choose to go on their own path. At Eventbrite, the way we approach this is by setting a golden path. We don't have a strict guideline on what teams can do. We give them a golden path, and we say, if you use these technologies and this software development life cycle, your life will be easy. We will take care of your problems for you. If you choose to strive out of that, you're on your own. You're a lone wolf. You need to take care of your own infra, your own platform, and everything. It's not forbidden, but it'll be more work for your team. One thing that we need to do is to maintain that. One team might be a lone wolf, but if we have two, three, four, five teams doing the same thing, it's not lone wolves, it's now a new pack. We need to put them back into the golden path by saying, this pattern that you're using is now part of a golden path because we see it becoming a new necessity that our company will have. Another thing is that when we grow to become leaders, you remember that person looking up to their leaders? Once you become this person, you are the person they look up to. Your work must not only be good anymore. Your work must be exemplary because people will look up to you. They will imitate you. They will copy how you work. Sometimes we feel that given our growth, we have great judgment, and we know when to cut corners, which changes we can push without testing, or whatever, which risks we can take, which corners we can cut. We do have that judgment, and we can make those calls, but we should be very cautious. It might be best not to make them only for the sake of being exemplary. If you choose to do that, some people might imitate you and choose to start cutting corners at their own judgment, and their judgment might be not as good as yours. That creates a challenge for the company. It's best if you choose to never cut corners so that you instill that way of working in your company, because it permeates into company culture without you knowing it. You should always be aware of that when you're a leader. Finally, and most importantly, we must stand for our peers and subordinates when we feel like they're being treated unfairly. Sometimes, as team leads or tech leads, we see how things operate within a team, and someone from above might not have that visibility, and unfairly blame someone for something that wasn't really their fault. It's our job to come up to them and tell them, "You're misunderstanding the situation. This person was not at fault here. There was a fault at the process. We should look into that instead of blaming the person". Remember, be ambitious, stay focused, be efficient, find your opportunities, and most importantly, take care of yourselves. Participant 1: I feel like when you grow in your career, you take on tasks which you didn't really do when you were more junior. It's like novel tasks. Have you seen opportunities, if you look back at your career, on how to maybe develop those skills when you don't necessarily have a chance to put them in practice? Rey: Yes, it's hard. It's good to try to jump the gun, and be ready before those necessities come. It's good to try to develop those necessities for yourself. I think it comes back to the early part of my talk, not aim for perfection, and aim for execution instead. I will not focus on what I will need in the future, I will focus on what I need today, and start being great at that. Once you have that covered, you can start looking into that. Without having the actual necessity and without having the opportunity to apply that in a productive environment, it becomes really hard to develop that on your own. The obvious way to do it is for tech skills, try to have some pet projects or whatever on the side that you can test new technologies or whatever. I wouldn't put too much effort into developing something that you might or might not need. If you were to do that, I would frame it like looking at your role models and looking at how they work. Because you can confirm that those are skills that are actually needed in your company. How do you develop them? The best thing to do is to ask them directly how you can develop those skills. Participant 2: As you mentioned, someone got hit, but then they got stronger. Do you think you're that kind of person, or what traits does this person have? Rey: I cannot tell you which kind of traits this person has. I sometimes can identify them, but I cannot put it into words yet. It's not a skill that I have developed. I wouldn't say that I'm that type of person all the time, but I have had opportunities where I came out stronger off a challenging situation. My whole team was let go at once and I was the only member who remained there. That was very challenging, but it was also very accelerating to my career growth. I think anybody has the capacity to do that, given the right environment. Environments, when they're challenging, people around us can help us to mitigate that challenge and come out stronger. Participant 3: What made you change teams and what advice would you give to someone considering that? Rey: Sometimes it's your choice and sometimes it isn't. If there's a topic that's of your interest, you should discuss that with your managers, your leaders, and tell them, I would like to work in this team in the future. It doesn't need to be this week, it doesn't need to be this quarter, but I would like to aim my career in that direction. Sometimes companies go through big reorgs and it's not your choice to end up in one team or another, but it is up to you to make the most out of it. It comes back to the big team player framework. How can I make the most out of this situation? It's challenging because you don't have the domain expertise, you don't have the knowledge, but you need to acknowledge that it's going to be a rough patch in your career where you need more time to learn, but that it can also be an opportunity if you can make this team succeed by now having you, and how you can do that. Participant 4: When you're just a junior engineer and you've been in your company for a good bit and you start to recognize some inefficiencies across the organization and the processes, do you think at that level you can already start to plan these initiatives and try to influence direction, or is that something you really have to wait for once you can achieve that level and have that influence? I'm curious on your perspective on that. Rey: I think it really depends on the context. It's not the same thing to do that at a company with 10,000 employees against doing that at a startup with 20 employees. If you're a junior at a startup, you're very well empowered to make those initiatives. Large companies tend to favor diversity of voices lately and tend to try to listen to anyone. There's the opportunity to do that, but it's much harder to come up with a real idea that will actually change the company if it's so big.

Thanks to Uncle Sam’s spending bender coinciding with the rise of the machines. Big tech stocks are about to remind Wall Street why it fell in love with these shares in the first place. Think you’ve seen a tech bubble before? Just wait until tech firms report earnings later this month! These companies are growing sales and profits by deploying robots instead of hiring humans.

This backdrop makes us contrarians bullish on stocks—with a twist. We could buy and hope for higher prices, but why? Instead, we can engineer dividend yields of 9% and 12% simply by “selling volatility.” To do this we consider covered call funds, which manufacture sweet synthetic dividends with upside price potential to boot. Take Christopher Dyer of Eaton-Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversity Equity Fund (EXG). Chris owns significant stakes in Alphabet (GOOG), owner of Waymo, the autonomous “robot” car company. My kids couldn’t stop talking about it after our recent San Francisco trip. Alphabet itself is becoming “autonomous.” Human hiring has halted. Yet despite flat headcount in the last year, revenues still grew by double digits—14%! Surviving highly-paid “Googlers” are understandably anxious. They developed Gemini, Alphabet’s AI tool, now being deployed enterprise-wide to automate countless tasks. Yes, they created their own monster. Chris’s next big holding for EXG is Amazon (AMZN). CEO Andy Jassy openly acknowledges that Amazon’s workforce will shrink over the next few years. Today may well be “peak headcount!” Microsoft (MSFT), Chris’s largest holding, laid off 6,000 employees in May and another 9,000 just last week. Yet Microsoft isn’t downsizing. It’s upsizing efficiency by rolling out its AI-driven sales and marketing teams, creating “driverless” departments that are equally effective and far cheaper. Tic tac toe, three AI-driven cash cows in a row. Chris is primed to enjoy an impressive earnings season. Remarkably, EXG still trades at a 6% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Meaning, we can grab MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN shares for just 94 cents on the dollar, right ahead of strong earnings. In the meantime, Chris boosts income by selling (writing) covered calls on broad market indexes to generate extra income. Hence EXG’s nifty 9% yield. Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD), managed by Nam To and Wayne Xie, follows a similar strategy and yields an attractive 12%. XYLD holds a substantial 40% tech allocation, capturing this automation-driven profitability boom. However, unlike closed-end fund EXG, XYLD trades at fair value—so no additional discount benefit here. The broader automation trend clearly impacts employment numbers. Last week’s headline 147,000 job gain appeared solid. But removing 73,000 new government jobs (aside: weren’t they supposed to be cutting?) leaves only a gain of 74,000 private-sector positions, significantly below the expected 105,000. Payroll processing firm ADP’s numbers last week were even harsher, a 33,000 private-sector job loss signaling AI’s impact already. The machines are here for the jobs. But we, my fellow contrarians, are here for the payouts—specifically the nifty 9% and terrific 12% yields I’m calling out. It’s big and already starting. Corporate automation plus a $3+ trillion spending bender from Uncle Sam is a powerful recipe for higher stock prices and bigger dividends. Let’s ignore the “tariff worry” headlines.

Title: Apple Should Fire CEO Tim Cook, Says Research Firm – But Will It Happen Anytime Soon?

Apple CEO Tim Cook should step down, says analysts at research firm LightShed, although it doesn’t expect to see the company make any changes soon. In a note to clients seen by Bloomberg, LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone say that “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics.” Apple shares have taken a bit of a hit this year, as Apple has proven to not be up to competing in the Artificial intelligence race.Â While Meta and Microsoft shares have enjoyed gains of 25% and 19%, respectively, Apple share prices have taken a 16% hit so far in 2025. From Piecyk and Joe Galone’s note: Missing on AI could fundamentally alter the company’s long-term trajectory and ability to grow at all. AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties. It should be noted that since Cook took over, Apple shares have gained over 1,400% , compared to 430% for the S&P 500. This indicates that this year’s stock price slide is but a blip in Apple’s overall performance under Cook. LightShed’s note to investors comes in the wake of the announcement that AppleÂ Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will be stepping down from his position later this month. Sabih Khan will be stepping into the COO role once Williams vacates his office. 30-year Apple veteran Williams had been considered as a potential successor for Cook. Now, Appleâs senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, is now considered to be the top candidate for the job. LightShed says “âTim Cookâ was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” but now that Williams is departing, “it’s time for more disruptive change, not less.” However, we shouldn’t expect to see Cook step down from his CEO role anytime soon. As pointed out byÂ Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, there are no immediate successors on the horizon. Plus, Cook doesn’t appear to be ready to step down and hasn’t shown any willingness to groom a successor. Plus, as Gurman points out, the Apple board seems content to keep having Cook pilot the company’s direction.Apple’s board of directors includes several Cook loyalists, such as Susan Wagner, Ronald Sugar, and Arthur Levinson. Gurman believe Cook could even tighten his grip on the Apple reins, as he could take over the role of Chairman, as Apple’s current Chairman, Levinson has already passed the company’s recommended board retirement age. Levinson could retire and Cook could slip into the Chairman role. We’ve seen this happen at other tech firms, with Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella making that move at their companies.

The S&P 500 climbs around +0.4%, hitting new highs with strong earnings optimism and cooling inflation data. Meanwhile, Dow Jones futures dip 0.1%, weighed by rising trade tariff concerns.

Title: The Elder Scrolls VI and a new Fallout: Xbox insider alleges exciting developments regarding two of Xbox's biggest franchises

Microsoft recently shook up its gaming division with tons of layoffs and multiple project cancellations. Among the canceled projects, there was ZeniMax Online’s unannounced “Project Blackbird” MMO RPG. It now appears that the cancellation of ZeniMax’s game might’ve given life to another Bethesda project, one that many fans have been asking for. In the latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast, Jez Corden claims that Microsoft decided to cancel ZeniMax’s MMO to allocate the capital to the development of Fallout 5. As such, the development of Fallout 5 has seemingly been greenlit. This is certainly good news for Fallout fans who have been disappointed by Fallout 76 and are waiting for a direct, single-player sequel to Fallout 4. Unfortunately, Jez reveals nothing about the potential Fallout 5 release date nor does he suggest anything about which studio is handling the development. Seeing as how Bethesda is busy supporting Fallout 76, Starfield, and is developing The Elder Scroll VI, it is difficult to imagine that the company has the bandwidth to start development of Fallout 5. Fortunately, Microsoft has another prolific RPG-maker in Obsidian. Assuming Obsidian is the studio behind Fallout 5, this wouldn’t be surprising as the studio has already worked on a Fallout game in the past, Fallout: New Vegas, which was quite well received. In addition to confirming Fallout 5, Jez also shares an interesting update regarding The Elder Scrolls VI. Back in June, before the Xbox Showcase 2025 aired, we reported that Microsoft could premier The Elder Scrolls VI at the event. The news came to us from Jez Corden who now alleges hearing that The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in a playable state. This was reportedly the basis for Jez’s earlier speculation that the game could show up at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. We must mention here that, aside from a short teaser trailer from 2018, Bethesda hasn’t revealed anything important about The Elder Scrolls VI. So, we have no idea how far along in development the game is or when it might release. If we have to speculate, we could see The Elder Scrolls VI release date falling sometime in 2027 to coincide with the launch of the next-gen Xbox. Having a game as big as The Elder Scrolls VI be a launch title for a new Xbox console would be a pretty big deal, as Sony is sure to prepare some heavy hitter for the PS6’s alleged 2027 release date. Before we take our leave, we must mention that we have no way of confirming these rumors. So, take the information with a giant grain of salt.

Title: What analysts and investors want to hear from CFOs this earnings season
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/what-analysts-investors-want-hear-cfo-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T11:38:29Z
Full Content:
Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily. Good morning. As the Q2 2025 earnings season begins, CFOs are navigating a landscape shaped by new tariffs, shifting consumer demand, and heightened market scrutiny. The first quarter benefited from a pull-forward of demand ahead of anticipated tariffs. In contrast, the second quarter will test companies’ ability to manage margin pressure, supply chain disruptions, and evolving trade policy risks. Major U.S. banks are among the first to report results this week. For all companies reporting, analysts will be “laser-focused” on how President Donald Trump’s import taxes are affecting corporate profits, according to Morningstar. A key theme is the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, with analysts closely watching for margin pressures, signs of slowing consumer demand, how companies are preparing for new tariffs, and how they are handling levies that have already been implemented. Markets have remained relatively calm heading into Q2, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recently reaching new highs. Morningstar notes that Q2 earnings are expected to reveal trends among firms in tariff-affected industries. Companies with higher costs and tighter margins may be forced to absorb more tariff expenses, while those with stronger competitive advantages may be able to pass more costs onto consumers. The momentum that propelled the S&P 500 to nearly an 11% gain in Q2 and more than 7% year-to-date will be tested this week, according to Saira Malik, chief investment officer at global investment manager Nuveen. Malik highlighted in a LinkedIn post on Monday two key dynamics: Q2 earnings reports from the financial sector, and a series of U.S. economic data releases, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for release this morning. Malik adds, “While overall earnings growth is expected to decelerate from last quarter, estimates have stabilized in recent weeks after falling sharply in early April. Still, the Q2 earnings bar is relatively low.” On the economic front, Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard, expects core CPI to increase 0.25% month over month (2.9% year over year) and headline CPI to rise 0.29% month over month (2.6% year over year), reflecting moderate strength following May’s soft print. “While tariff-related pressures are beginning to show in select goods categories in the PCE, the overall pass-through into CPI remains limited for now as firms hold off on retail price hikes,” he said in an emailed statement. Regarding CFO sentiment, Deloitte’s Q2 2025 CFO Signals report, released last week, found that growth expectations declined across every key operational metric, with finance chiefs lowering projections for revenue, earnings, and capital investments. However, Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte’s CFO Program, described the current environment as a recalibration, not a retreat. Finance leaders are doubling down on fundamentals: sharpening focus on growth drivers, managing controllable risks, and staying active in M&A. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leeny Oberg, CFO and EVP of development at Marriott International (No. 171) has decided to retire effective March 31, 2026, after spending more than two decades with the U.S. hotel operator. Oberg, CFO since 2016, will be succeeded by Jen Mason, who joined Marriott in 1992 and currently serves as global officer, treasurer and risk management. Mason is also a former CFO of the U.S. and Canada at the company. Shawn Hill was promoted to the role of EVP and chief development officer, effective Jan. 1. Oberg has been in that role since February 2023. Every Friday morning, the weekly Fortune 500 Power Moves column tracks Fortune 500 company C-suite shifts—see the most recent edition. Mark Mesler has stepped down from his position as CFO of Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR), effective July 7, according to an SEC filing. Mesler had been on medical leave since September 2024. During his absence, Priya Gupta has served as CFO and acting principal financial officer. Gupta will continue in these roles. Harsh Rungta will also remain as SVP of finance and chief accounting officer and principal accounting officer. Sarah C. Young was appointed CFO at Bell Partners, a privately held company specializing in apartment investment and management, and will succeed John Tomlinson upon his planned retirement effective Aug. 22. Young joined the company on July 14 and will report to Lili Dunn, CEO and president of Bell Partners. After his retirement, Tomlinson will remain as an advisor to the company through the end of 2025. Young previously served as CFO and senior managing director at Quarterra Group, a subsidiary of homebuilder Lennar, where she worked for 10 years. Before that, Young was part of the finance group at Walton Street Capital. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)’s Q2 2025 Quarterly Survey found that 62% of directors cite shifting economic conditions as the top business issue for boards. Also, in the findings from the 305 directors surveyed, AI now outranks cybersecurity, supply chains, and even talent competition in terms of business issues. Although AI remains a top focus, NACD says it is clear from survey responses that organizations are in very different positions with respect to AI adoption and implementation. Some companies are in the middle of the implementation of AI projects, working to “move beyond pilots to deployments” or focusing on improving governance of AI, including determining “where it can be implemented and why, and internal controls around verification of output.” “Elon Musk spent months slashing federal contracts—Now his AI company is celebrating a $200M Pentagon contract and new unit to get government business” is a new Fortune report by Jessica Mathews. Elon Musk’s xAI, a two-year-old AI company, said in a blog post Monday that it has launched a new division, called “Grok with Government,” and signed a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense, Mathews writes. xAI also announced that it had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products will now be available for purchase across every government office and agency.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Republican strategists want lawmakers to get specific when selling the “big, beautiful bill” to voters. State and local officials defend their response to the catastrophic floods in Central Texas. And Tucker Carlson explains why he’s pushing back against some of Trump’s recent decisions. Here’s what to know today. Now that Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is signed into law, it’s likely the president will continue to use the alliterative turn of phrase he coined in talking about the legislation. But those in his own party, as well as Democrats, know those superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the price of gas and groceries — so they’re setting out to explain what the bill means for daily life. Two Republican strategists said they’re advising lawmakers to use different titles — such as the “Working Family Tax Cuts” act or possibly the “Trump Working Family Tax Cuts” — when referring to the legislation. The aim is to allude to policies, like no taxes on tips or overtime, that were popular among Trump voters. They’re also advising lawmakers to tout the additional money going to states for border enforcement. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The White House also believes that other parts of the bill that may not have gotten as much attention are widely popular. For example, Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation’s air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act. Trump, however, isn’t planning to traverse the nation to pitch the bill to voters. Instead, it’ll fall largely on his administration. An early test comes tomorrow, when Vice President JD Vance gives a speech at a machine shop in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to highlight how the bill “helps working class people most of all,” a person familiar with the speech said. Democrats, meanwhile, are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn. At stake is control of Congress, which is up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections. Read the full story here. Local and state officials who responded to the catastrophic flooding this month in Central Texas said they did everything in their power to save lives. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, Kerr County Commissioner Jeff Holt and state Rep. Wes Virdell told NBC News over the weekend that officials did their best to coordinate evacuations and rescues against uncontrollable forces of nature. "Our teams did everything they possibly could with this gruesome, devastating situation that happened, and we would not change the way we did that. And I think we saved as many people as we could," Rice said. However, the officials noted that a permanent emergency operations center, more diversion dams and better cellphone service in certain areas might save lives in future floods. At least 132 people have died after the Guadalupe River surged to unprecedented heights in the early morning of July 4. More than 160 people are still missing. Kerr County and Kerrville officials held separate meetings yesterday about the ongoing flood response, though they mostly steered clear of addressing speculation over how leaders communicated about the floods. Read the full story here. A study of more than 1.2 million people found that there is no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. The study, published yesterday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, used Denmark’s nationwide registry to study people born between 1997 and 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared to those who received less. The study looked for connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions and five neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD. Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said on a 2024 podcast that aluminum in vaccines is “extremely neurotoxic.” Read the full story here. NBC News' politics team has been closely tracking MAGA influencers raising the alarm about some the moves by President Donald Trump and his administration — whether that means bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, floating a deportation carve-out for undocumented farm workers or shutting down the release of additional information on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. No one’s pushback garnered more curiosity, though, than Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host-turned-"America First" thought leader who was gifted a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last summer. Carlson had been aligned closely with the president after both men found themselves in exile after Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 election. I was able to get Carlson on the phone and ask about what’s been driving his recent criticism. “I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson told me last week, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.” Carlson spoke with me at a key moment for MAGA that is testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump, the man who brought the movement together, can shift its direction. If any of these influencers can play a role in shaping Trump's right-wing alliance, it's Carlson. — Allan Smith, politics reporter Want to perfectly block out other sounds or run with perfectly balanced audio?

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Jensen Huang is not an AI doomer, but he said developing tech could cause job losses if humans can’t come up with new ideas. As CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker now worth $4 trillion, Huang has a unique insight on the acceleration of AI adoption, and most of what he sees is positive. While some AI critics have warned the technology will lead to mass layoffs, Huang said it’s not likely. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” Huang told CNN. Just take a look at history: over the hundreds of years past as technology advanced, productivity gains went hand-in-hand with employment gains, said Huang. “Over the course of the last 300 years, 100 years, 60 years, even, in the era of computers, not only did productivity go up, employment also went up,” he said. “Now the reason for that is if we have an abundance of ideas, ways that we could build a better future, if we were more productive, we could realize that better.” The development of AI could also help humans by helping to surface new ideas across industries. The possibility of adding AI-enabled robots to fill the 30- to 40-million worker gap in skilled labor could also be positive and could help industry and the economy grow. Yet, without new ventures and ideas, the future looks more bleak, he said. “If you have no more ideas and all you want to do is this, then productivity drives down. It results in job loss.” Huang’s comments stand in stark contrast to those of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who said AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white collar jobs and spike unemployment by double digits over the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also warned AI will reduce the company’s total corporate workforce. Huang stands out as one of the more optimistic leaders in the AI space, although he noted that AI will certainly transform all jobs, and has already changed his own responsibilities. Although, he cheekily noted, he is still doing the job. Rather than fully replace humans, AI is already supercharging their productivity by equalizing the playing field, and hopefully, the productivity gains lift society, he added. “AI empowers people, it lifts people, it closes the gap, the technology gap, and as a result more and more people are going to be able to do more things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The official menopause wiki for Lemmy's c/menopause community, and its Reddit siblings, r/menopause and r/perimenopause. The following information is intended for educational purposes only, to provide a basis on which to further explore with your doctors. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Find a menopause practitioner at the following menopause societies or check our Menopause Provider Directory for more Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural biological process, experienced by half the population. Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first.

According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.
