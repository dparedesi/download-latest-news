Title: Honeywell, Caterpillar CTOs say AI can ease labor, skills gaps in manufacturing

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Honeywell says that 20% of the company’s software code is written by GitHub Copilot and other AI-assistant coding tools. But, does that mean that the industrial giant’s embrace of AI has corresponded with a 20% reduction in that team’s workforce? No, according to Suresh Venkatarayalu, the chief technology officer and president of the company’s software-focused division, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. “What has changed is the type of developer skill sets,” said Venkatarayalu at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference held last week in Park City, Utah. With less time needed to write code, Honeywell’s software developers can perform more complex work, including spending more time in the field with customers to solve their system integration needs. For decades, the industrial sector has been embracing automation technologies that have made it easier to move goods across the factory floor, perform quality control inspections, and monitor machinery to predict when a fix may be in order before any breakdowns occur. Workers have also gotten more access to AI-enabled tools, helping recommend when supplies need reordering, predict demand from customers, and help handle repetitive back-office tasks. AI represents yet another new way to rethink manufacturing automation. Many are still early in their adoption journey, with only 29% using AI or machine learning at the factory or network level, and just one out of four having deployed generative AI at that scale, according to a survey of 600 executives from large manufacturing companies by consultancy Deloitte. Jaime Mineart, SVP and CTO of construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, joined Venkatarayalu during the panel discussion and shared leaders need to change how their workers engage with technology. That might include classes in prompt engineering, so they know how to get the most out of large language models, specialized training in how to work alongside robots, or lessons on how to glean insights from the data streaming from a more connected manufacturing ecosystem. “It’s huge change management,” Mineart said. The biggest challenges that they will need to solve will be related to both labor capability and labor availability, she added. Venkatarayalu sees things slightly differently. In the U.S. and other developed markets, he believes that there is a labor shortage. But in higher growth regions, the problem is more focused on the skills gap. “The only way to offset the labor shortage and a skills shortage is to augment with something, and that something is AI,” said Venkatarayalu. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers last year found that nearly 60% of manufacturers report that their inability to attract and retain employees is their top challenge. A separate study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute last year showed that 1.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs could go unfilled over a decade if the talent woes aren’t addressed. Meanwhile, the median tenure of a manufacturing worker has slipped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mineart said automation and AI can help move workers away from less safe, duller, and more repetitive tasks. “Those are jobs that robots, robotics, and technology can really do very, very well, alongside that human capability and that human creativity to get more productivity and safer work sites,” she said. Caterpillar and Honeywell share some similarities in that they are both over a century old and are on the Fortune 500 (Caterpillar at 64, Honeywell at 119). But their AI journeys are evolving in different ways. Honeywell, which is in the process of splitting itself into three different companies, has launched new generative AI features for customers including an AI assistant to automate tasks for operators and production workers and has inked partnerships with Google, Chevron, and Qualcomm to collaborate more on AI innovation. Caterpillar’s revenue is getting a boost from the data center boom that’s leading to stronger sales of the company’s generators. It has also pledged $100 million over the next five years to upskill workers on evolving technologies, including AI. “When you think about bringing manufacturing back into the United States, we have to reimagine how we are going to do that,” said Mineart. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Momentum continues to build for quantum. While the most promising advancements for quantum computing look to be at least a few years away, excitement for the developing field is accelerating as seen by a Wall Street Journal report last week that quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raised $1 billion from investors including BlackRock and Nvidia’s venture-capital arm to bring the company’s total valuation to $7 billion. There’s been quite a bit of funding action in the space in recent weeks, with Honeywell’s quantum computing company, Quantinuum, and Europe’s IQM Quantum Computers both disclosing funding rounds earlier this month. WSJ also separately reported on IBM’s efforts to lead in the space, which includes a partnership with chip maker AMD to develop “quantum-centric supercomputers.” Automation is more popular than augmentation for Anthropic’s Claude. Anthropic, the AI startup whose CEO warned that the technology could wipe out 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in five years, published a broad report this week that found that 77% of enterprises’ usage of Claude AI software was focused on automation, with just 12% for augmentation (which includes improved collaboration and learning). Peter McCrory, head of economics at Anthropic, told Bloomberg that it wasn’t clear whether the increase in automation was due to “new model capabilities that are expanding the set of things that get automated, or if it’s people being more comfortable with large language models and becoming more willing to delegate certain tasks to Claude.” As OpenAI spends big, questions begin to swirl on the startup’s monetization strategy. Wall Street cheered the news of Oracle’s $300 billion cloud deal last week, an OpenAI halo that’s also lifting the valuations of key investor Microsoft, AI chip maker Nvidia, and Broadcom, the latter seeing a stock pop after it was reported that OpenAI placed a $10 billion order for its custom AI chips. The thesis of all this investment is that enterprises and individual customers will spend on AI at exponentially higher rates than they are today, to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars that OpenAI is putting into AI infrastructure. That’s not necessarily a guarantee, with studies and surveys beginning to call into question the success of generative AI pilots and very few paying individual customers. While nearly two billion individuals use AI, only 3% of them are paying for premium services, which includes ChatGPT, according to a study by Menlo Ventures. AI skills are becoming a job requirement A report on the Group of 7 nations found that 78% of all tech roles now include at least some AI skills and that seven of the 10 fastest-growing tech roles are related to AI. The highest in-demand roles that saw the largest year-over-over growth are AI risk and governance specialist (234%), NLP engineer (186%), AL/ML engineer (145%), AI business consultant (134%), and AI infrastructure engineer (124%), according to a study published by the AI Workforce Consortium, a group of ten large employers that includes Google, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, and SAP. Beyond merely hiring new talent for those roles, AI Workforce Consortium is also advocating for more upskilling, saying that tech skills like prompt engineering, conversational AI, and generative AI require “immediate” intervention to cater to the job market demand. “I think there has been a gap, for quite some time, between higher education and corporations,” Fran Katsoudas, Cisco's chief people, policy and purpose officer, tells Fortune. Those gaps were initially focused on soft skills, including learning how to collaborate on a project or respectfully disagree. Now, corporations will need to take that same college-to-work skills gap playbook and apply it to AI. “Part of the challenge is when companies think about training or education, we make it very individualized,” adds Katsoudas. “Enterprise education has to be more team- and roll-based.” Courtesy of The AI Workforce Consortium Hiring: - Jefferson Center for Mental Health is seeking a CIO, based in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Title: End Quarterly Earnings Forecasts But Not Quarterly Reporting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2025/09/17/end-quarterly-earnings-forecasts-but-not-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T18:53:00Z

ByMichael Posner, Senior Contributor. President Donald Trump has proposed reducing the frequency of corporate financial reporting requirements from four reports a year to two. He made the same suggestion in 2018. Trump justifies this idea by saying, “This will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He is only half right: the reduced reporting will indeed save companies money. But at the same time, it will reduce transparency, denying investors, government regulators, and the public access to essential information that is of broad public concern. This is yet another example of the administration’s efforts to roll back data collection and dissemination on a wide range of topics. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required publicly traded companies to file quarterly financial reports since 1970. These reports provide a snapshot of financial performance, a collection of unaudited financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These numbers help investors assess a company's growth, profitability, and financial health. But in the wake of the president’s announcement, the SEC now says that it is prioritizing his proposal “to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.” This is the latest in a series of administration steps aimed at reducing government oversight of corporate actions. It’s important to separate the two different aspects of the corporate reporting process. The first is the role these reports play in generating data that investors use to make quarterly earnings forecasts. These forecasts reinforce the investment model for many on Wall Street, prioritizing the maximization of short-term shareholder profits at the expense of a company’s long-term value. Extending the reporting period from three to six months will do very little to correct this investor-driven short-termism, which disincentivizes C-suite executives who wish to invest in environmental and social safeguards. In 2018, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, which rightly called for the end to quarterly earnings forecasts. They wrote, “in our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.” But they also stressed that this “should not be misconstrued as opposition to quarterly and annual reporting.” Rather, they emphasized that, “[tr]ansparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets.” Dimon and Buffett are not alone in this assessment. FCLTGlobal, a non-profit that began as a joint initiative of BlackRock, McKinsey, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Fund, and others, also promotes longer-term thinking in finance. A report they published in 2017 argues that the publication of “[q]uarterly earnings remains essential in providing investors with the transparency they need and in keeping management teams accountable for their performance.” FCLTGlobal suggests that instead of reducing reporting requirements, companies should be encouraged to incorporate long-term goals in their public reporting and to discuss the progress they are making toward these goals each quarter. The second reason for doing these reports, called 10-Q filings, is to provide investors and the public with information on a range of topics that enhance corporate transparency and provide a measure of accountability. This is more important than ever in the current political moment, when the Trump administration is relaxing federal ethical standards and enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On their own, quarterly financial reports cannot reverse this current trend, but they can provide a hedge against the most egregious conduct. To paraphrase former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”10-Q reports are divided into two parts. The first includes financial statements, disclosures about market risks, analysis of the company’s financial situation by management, and discussion of its internal controls. These disclosures give individual and institutional investors the information they need to make informed investment decisions. The second part of these reports covers a range of other topics that helps investors and the public identify potential risks, such as whether there are legal or default proceedings pending against the company, or the unregistered sales of equity securities. Not surprisingly, this is information that company leaders often are not eager to disclose. Under the law, they must. This provides all of us with an important source of accountability. As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the President’s proposal is likely to meet resistance from investors. The Journal wrote, “Institutional investors such as pension funds and hedge funds typically crave more information on the companies they follow, not less.” And as T. Rowe Price has observed, even longer-term investors benefit from quarterly reports, “because these short-term progress reports increase our confidence in our ability to predict a company’s long-range outcome.” In an era of increasing corporate power and declining regulatory oversight, maintaining robust quarterly reporting requirements isn’t just good policy—it’s essential for market integrity and public accountability.

Title: Rick Rieder Overhauls BlackRock Bond Team as HPS Clout Grows

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is revamping its massive fixed-income division around new investment strategies and artificial intelligence, as the unit’s leveraged finance business moves under an executive team from the firm’s newly acquired HPS Investment Partners. The changes mark a new vision for the group and reflect the credit market’s “dramatic and transformative” evolution, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The move also underscores the growing clout of the private financing solutions group led by HPS’s top executives — a key business for the firm as it expands in private and alternative credit and competes with the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. BlackRock’s leveraged-finance business will remain under the stewardship of David Delbos and Mitch Garfin, but will be folded into the PFS business from global fixed income, according to the memo. The PFS franchise is overseen by Scott Kapnick, Scot French and Michael Patterson, the HPS leaders who completed the $12 billion sale of the private-credit specialist to BlackRock in July. A representative for the company declined to comment. It’s the latest move in a sweeping plan to re-wire BlackRock. Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink is staking a big part of his company’s future on private markets and his ability to combine them with the public stock and bond strategies and ETFs that have powered the firm’s rise. BlackRock has spent billions to become a major player in alternative and private assets and data, and the HPS purchase turned it into a private-credit behemoth nearly overnight. Rieder, who met last week with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the role of Federal Reserve chair, laid out new investment plans for BlackRock’s fixed-income group in the memo. It will build out core fixed-income portfolios and plans to develop a so-called core-plus-related solution that is “more powerful,” he said. As part of the changes, Rieder said Russ Brownback will become deputy CIO of global fixed income. David Rogal, meanwhile, has informed the company that he intends to explore opportunities outside the firm, Rieder said. Bank of America Corp.’s David Koh will join BlackRock in a newly created role as chief investment strategist, he added. Rieder’s group plans to start a fixed-income hedge fund dubbed TriaXial, he said. It also intends to develop a higher-income version of BINC, a popular active bond ETF with $12.3 billion in assets that Rieder manages. He is responsible for roughly $2.4 trillion in total, according to the firm’s website. “Technology will be a significant part of the work,” said Rieder. “The ability to use AI, machine learning and new data” will help develop new tools to improve investment returns. --With assistance from Laura Noonan and Jeremy Hill.

Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year. Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for. Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month. While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking. It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring. Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value. When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201). Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201). The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Listen to the Stepchange Show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome to the third episode of the Stepchange Show—where we explore the technologies and systems that have transformed human civilization. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, scroll a feed, or chat with your favorite AI, you’re touching an invisible, physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn’t in the sky. It is astonishingly physical—alive in over 12,000 buildings around the world, consuming almost five percent of U.S. electricity, and running through cables laid across the ocean floor. This is the story of data centers. From the humming punch-card rooms of the 1930s to the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and onward to the gigawatt-scale AI factories of today, data centers have quietly become the industrial engine of our era. Six companies—NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—now dominate global markets in part because they command this infrastructure, just as railroads, steel, and oil once defined the fortunes of the last century. Data centers are the machines behind the modern world. They shape commerce, media, communication, and now artificial intelligence, and raise profound questions about energy, water, and climate. Join us as we uncover the physical reality of our digital world.

Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:00): All right, Anay. Well, kids are in school. Anay Shah (00:00:04): Kids are in school. We survived the summer. I love how back to school kind of feels like the beginning of a new year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:11): It does. I always thought this time of year was the actual new year. Anay Shah (00:00:16): I like that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:28): Welcome to the third episode of the Step Change Show. We're here to cover the stories of human progress. We want to understand the technologies, systems, and infrastructure that shape our world. I'm Ben Eidelson, a co-founder of Step Change Ventures, a fund that invests in the companies that are accelerating today's biggest step changes. I'm based up in Seattle, Washington. Anay Shah (00:00:46): And I'm Anay Shah, fellow co-founder of Step Change Ventures, based in Los Angeles, California. Today we're going to be telling the story of the hyperscale-up of a recent infrastructure: the story of data centers. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, call a car to pick you up, or talk to what feels like a fully formed computational consciousness, you are touching an invisible physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn't in the sky. It lives somewhere very, very real. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:01:20): It lives in nearly 12,000 buildings worldwide, consuming almost 5% of electricity in the U.S. It also lives inside these garden-hose-sized cables that are laid across the darkest parts of the ocean floor. Today we are going to tell the story of this invisible infrastructure—a story that begins in the humming and clattering punch card rooms of the early 1900s, winds through the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and leads to the gigawatt-scale AI factories the size of Lower Manhattan that are being built today. Anay Shah (00:01:50): The U.S. stock market is worth around $60 trillion, made up of over 4,000 companies. But there are just six companies at the top—Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—that make up 30% of that market. They are today's railroads, steel, and oil companies, building the modern industrial engine of our time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:12): This is the story of data centers. But before we do, just one quick note: We have all of the research links and notes for this episode up at StepChangeShow. And if you are listening to this and you think of a friend or colleague who might enjoy it, please send it over their way. All of this is a new endeavor for us, and we appreciate it getting into the hands—or rather ears—of folks who may dig it. All right, so data centers. Anay Shah (00:02:36): So Ben, I was recently reading an article saying these new technologies are saving work for everyone nowadays. Pretty soon we'll have nothing to do at all. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:44): That's right. I think they were saying that we have some new electronic brain that's going to make most workers obsolete. Anay Shah (00:02:49): Right. But the CEO behind one of these technologies quickly countered, saying that it was a way to save time, not replace jobs. He said it was a small tool to help great minds benefit mankind. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:00): Was this the CEO of Anthropic, OpenAI, or maybe Google? Anay Shah (00:03:04): You might think so, but no. This was Thomas J. Watson Sr., the original leader of IBM. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:11): So, IBM, the computational powerhouse of the last century. Long before we had the Googles, Amazons, Metas, and Microsofts, there was Big Blue IBM. And long before IBM ever built an electronic computer, they were doing computation of a different sort. Anay Shah (00:03:32): And if you walked into a large company back in the 1930s, you might find yourself in one of their windowless rooms, humming and clattering like a small factory. There'd be long rows of metal cabinets, whirring gears, and clerks feeding stacks of stiff paper cards into these behemoth machines. Each card was a sliver of information: an employee's hours, an invoice, maybe a customer's address. But together, they formed the first centralized nerve center for corporate data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:05): And I think that's why we argue that those rooms, with those cards of information being processed on these devices that were doing computing, are the first real data centers. Anay Shah (00:04:17): That machine has quite an interesting history, born to solve a government problem: the problem of the U.S. census. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:26): It's wild. The 1880 census data was collected in 1880, and it took seven years before it was tabulated. They realized it just was not working at human computation scale anymore. Anay Shah (00:04:37): And so one man, Herman Hollerith, had an invention to solve this. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:42): He observed the way railroad conductors checked tickets, noting that these were papers with punched-out holes that ultimately stored and represented information. If you could build a machine that could count the number of punch holes, you could then do computation at scale without needing humans to count markdowns on a form. Anay Shah (00:05:05): That's right. These cards stored information, and then you could have machines compute off of them. The 1890 census was the machine's first big break. Even with a population 25% larger than the decade before, it was completed in two years instead of more than seven years, and it came $5 million under budget. That's not something a new technology could typically achieve for a government. So, fast forward to Watson. He sees the punch card machine and understands what it can do. By the mid-1920s, he's convinced. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:37): So by 1924, he rebranded the company International Business Machines. Anay Shah (00:05:42): A much more fitting name than CTR. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:47): Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. Anay Shah (00:05:50): "There is no limit for this tabulating business," he told his executives in 1927. He doubled down, selling off all the other less promising lines of business and pouring the company's resources into the tabulating division. They designed a proprietary 80-column IBM card that only worked on IBM machines, which became the IBM card—a sort of early-days lock-in where customers who wanted to use the machines had to buy the cards. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:22): Everyone obsesses over the Gillette razor blade business model, but the IBM card was not only how you did the computation, but it also stored information and became your record-keeping method inside businesses running on these IBM machines. Anay Shah (00:06:35): Once you put invoices, time cards, and all of that information onto the IBM card, you're not migrating it off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:41): It's on a piece of paper. Anay Shah (00:06:42): Yeah, that's right. So now you've produced a very steady stream of revenue alongside selling the tabulator machine. The timing for this was perfect. This is the late '20s, early '30s. The New Deal brought in a massive government focus around record-keeping. In 1935, the Social Security Administration signed a contract with IBM, requiring millions of their cards and machines to process benefits and print checks. One of their New York plants was soon printing 10 million cards per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:14): It's amazing. Anay Shah (00:07:15): And within a couple decades, most large companies had punch card rooms. They had various machines they used to sort, tabulate, and store financial information, payroll information, employee information, customer information—everything you could think of. In order to manage that, they'd hire clerks and technical specialists to operate and maintain it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:36): It's easy to take for granted, but this was the first time a company, its accounting, and its invoicing could be calculated at this scale. Think about what was going on in this era: companies were starting to scale in new ways. More global trade was also starting to happen. Thomas Watson Sr. ended up very interested in diplomacy, traveling around the world trying to preach that commerce across borders would create peace. Unfortunately, this backfired. He did a lot of commerce with Germany in the lead-up to the Holocaust, and there are many stories around IBM's computational power being used to help Germans with record-keeping. Ultimately, this product was foundational to so much of the scale of this era, including the scale of war. Every time there was a war or a big government project, regardless of which country was fighting, they needed IBM machines to do calculations. Anay Shah (00:08:34): This was the way to process and store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:38): But it was all still cards and mechanical switches, ultimately. Anay Shah (00:08:42): And rooms full of paper. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:44): Rooms of paper. So everyone was running on punch cards. What was this thing? What was this room? What should we call it? Anay Shah (00:08:50): This is where we're going to put our stake in the ground and say the earliest data centers came out of the IBM punch card data center. The easiest way to understand it is: it's a physical space or a collection of facilities designed to house and operate an organization's data and computing infrastructure. You can think of it as primarily storing information, computing information, and over time, connecting and allowing for the communication of information. At its basic core, a data center in the evolution we're going to talk about from the mid-1900s to the present day is the physical space around storage, computing, and connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:09:33): At this moment, IBM was already a growing company of import, right? Doing global international business. By 1945, they had around 25,000 employees and annual revenue of approximately $140 million. But something was about to change, and that was also coming out of the war. World War II was this big moment of government investment in R&D. One of the things they often found themselves doing was calculating artillery firing tables, which took into account the wind speed, weather, and all these different factors to figure out where they should shoot artillery. There were teams of human computers, clerks who were doing mechanical calculation to figure things out. But that was a bottleneck. So the army funded a team at the University of Pennsylvania to build the first real electronic computer, a machine that could crank through those calculations an order of magnitude faster. That became the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, also known as ENIAC. Anay Shah (00:10:33): This was all about math. It was focused on calculating numbers and producing mathematical results that would help them, in this case, be more efficient in war planning. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:44): Yeah, I mean, they didn't have the... Anay Shah (00:10:45): TI-83 or the games that go on it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:48): It, or the games that go on it. They didn't have Tetris. So they needed a calculator that could go faster than the people who were a bottleneck at this point. The ENIAC had no mechanical parts that slowed its operation. It took up nearly a 2,000-square-foot room, but it did operate over 1,000 times faster than any previous computational device. It could execute 5,000 additions per second. At this time, IBM, with its commercial product—the quickest punch card machine—could complete just four additions a second. So it wasn't an order of magnitude faster; it was three orders of magnitude faster. Anay Shah (00:11:25): Four additions per second to 5,000 additions per second. This seems like something mathematicians and CEOs privy to this would think, "Oh, I can see the future." But no. A distinguished Harvard mathematician dismissed the idea as foolishness, saying there would be no big market for computers. He believed that the country would need maybe half a dozen, mainly for military and scientific research. Our friend Thomas J. Watson Sr. said general-purpose computers had nothing whatsoever to do with IBM or IBM's mainline of equipment and profitability. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:11:59): But Watson's stubbornness to stay wedded to the past was only matched and maybe outdone by his son's stubbornness to push the company forward. Anay Shah (00:12:09): Runs in the family, but takes a different shape. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:12): This is a father-and-son story for the ages. Thomas Watson Jr. eventually fought in the war, came back, and was ready to take his seat as a leader inside IBM. He viewed electronics as the future of the company, and this became the intergenerational battle for the control of IBM. Thomas Watson Jr. saw that there was a future for the company in electronics and wanted to push it that way. Anay Shah (00:12:38): There's some interesting parent-child psychology where you can see him completely frustrated and angry that his father's not going to jump on what he thinks is very clearly the future. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:50): IBM did do a wartime project with Harvard mathematician Howard Aiken that was a kind of hybrid electromechanical vacuum-tube machine. They followed that with their first machine that they really wanted to demonstrate to the public after the war. This was called the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC). This was in 1948. They showed that in a Madison Avenue showroom, right in the middle of Manhattan, so that people could walk by and see this thing computing. Anay Shah (00:13:20): And to see this thing, these machines were still the size of rooms. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:13:25): And it was fast, not by today's standards, but by those days, it was very fast. It didn't have any memory in the sense that we were used to computers today having memory, but it had this punched paper tape as a form of storage. Despite Thomas Watson Sr. not liking this as the new business, he didn't mind the company getting some PR points for it. They'd send reporters down to watch the machine do computation. This is the moment when the press said, "Pretty soon no one's going to have a job to do as a result of this electronic brain." Anay Shah (00:13:54): The electronic brain that would displace workers. And so, in 1951, IBM's longtime customer, the U.S. Census Bureau, went with Univac instead of IBM tabulators for its next census. Thomas Watson Jr. recalls this moment, saying, "My God, Univac is smart enough to start taking all the civilian business away!" This is really what shakes IBM to once again reinvent itself. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:14:22): You go back to 1880, 1890. This whole invention was for the census problem. And that problem gets harder: more people, more things you want to know about people, and more factors you want to track. And so, that is actually a perfect test bed for computation at this time. Here comes the ENIAC team, now commercialized with Univac, and that wakes IBM right up. Anay Shah (00:14:41): And this company's been growing, right? IBM, in 1940, was doing about $45 million in revenue with 12,000 employees. And a decade later, they're doing $250 million in revenue with 30,000 employees. And if you're betting the company on a new direction, things could go south for a lot of people. It's a big responsibility for Watson Jr. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:02): And they pushed forward. And so, out of these early computer experiments, they finally built their first commercial product, which was the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine. This is the first real machine where they thought, "Hey, we're going to build more than one of these, and we're going to sell some of them. We're actually going to try and make this into a business, not just a research project." Anay Shah (00:15:20): And as we'll see with some of the companies closer to the present day, they had an installed base of customers; they had a sales machine. And so, they started this business line, and within five years, they had 85% of the computer market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:34): That's right. So, that team that invented the first vacuum tube computer in the ENIAC and then the Univac, they got outrun by the better commercial go-to-market sales machine that, if you remember, IBM was founded with. So, who was buying these things, and how many did they sell? Well, the 701 was still a pretty bespoke product. They sold 19. These were going to National Labs, the Weather Bureau, and a lot of aerospace firms that were doing a lot of calculations. And the whole business model was actually not around buying these machines; it was an extension of the tabulating business model that IBM had always had, where they wanted you to lease the machine, rent it, and buy punch cards. Anay Shah (00:16:08): We got hardware as a service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:10): Exactly. It was a beautiful business model. The era of the '50s for IBM was going from this research-centered product to what I'd consider their Model T. So, in this era, they built the first disk drive. They started using tape in addition to punch cards. They wrote Fortran, which is the first real kind of modern programming language where you could write words, and it would get translated into computer instructions by the end of the decade. In 1959, they launched the IBM 1401, which was available to thousands of companies. And they ended up selling around 12,000 of those machines. They exited the decade with a real... Anay Shah (00:16:45): computing business, and they're dominating the market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:48): So, that first machine shipped 19 systems. They had another machine that shipped 123. After that, they had the first transistorized Model T. The 1401 crossed over 10,000 units. From 1950 to 1962, IBM's revenue rose tenfold, from $260 million to $2.6 billion. And their headcount went from 30,000 employees to almost 130,000 employees. Woo! Anay Shah (00:17:12): And so, what else is happening right now? We're in the 1950s; World War II has ended. The Cold War is getting colder. And we find that the Soviet Union's long-range nuclear-armed bombers are able to cross the Arctic and reach American cities in a matter of hours. So, this makes the decision window to detect and intercept down to two minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:17:36): It's easy to forget, but the Cold War was primarily a technological arms race. Who's going to get there faster if something's going down? If the Soviet Union launches these bombers, how quickly can we respond, know about it, and then respond? And our Air Force and our defense systems were not designed for that speed. Anay Shah (00:17:53): Yeah, every threat forced a technology upgrade, forced our government to respond, to invest. We had a laboratory project at MIT that, in 1951, could process live radar data in real time, proving that automation could close this gap that we were seeing in national security. The challenge was: how do you take this radar research prototype and turn it into a 24/7 machine that can operate at government scale? And this is a moment that became the largest computing project to date. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:18:23): Thomas Watson Jr. saw this, and he knew that they needed to win this contract. IBM actually had a policy of essentially making only 1% profit on any defense work, which they kept throughout this. But they said this would push them to the future. And so, the contract awarded in 1954 became one of the largest contracts ever, worth more than $500 million in 1950s dollars. Around $5.5 billion in today's dollars. And so, how did it work? What did it do at full deployment when they got there in the 1960s? It was a network that spanned 27 different centers, where each center had a pair of special IBM computers designed for this. In case one of them was being serviced or down, the other one would become primary. So they built redundancy into the network. And the scale was unprecedented. In total, it was 56 computers. These were acre-sized floors, with multi-megawatt power draw to these systems. And they were connected—connected over early modems. This was the moment that really drove the production of the modem, where you could actually have data sent over telephone lines. And so, they would lease special lines between these centers. Anay Shah (00:19:32): And these centers have characteristics that we're going to talk about more. You have redundancy built into this; you have building-level scale; you've got multiple facilities networked together. These end up being a lot of the same characteristics that drive data center growth and evolution decades later. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:19:52): That's right. And I feel like there's the scale of it, but I think the connectivity of this system is the difference. You have storage; you have compute, which was happening; but now you had connection and communication, because you want this center over here to respond to information that was computed over there. And so, this moment in history—the SAGE system, I think—is the first real time that machines were communicating with each other. Pretty big moment. Anay Shah (00:20:17): So, once we're able to do this in government, it's going to catch the eyes of other industries. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:23): The airlines had seen the SAGE project take off, and they were sitting there with a new problem on their hands. This was the '60s. Air flight was booming, and the way that reservations got processed was absolutely insane. You would call your travel agent; your travel agent would call the airline; and the airline would have to run clerks around, pulling cards out to book a seat. Supposedly it took up to 90 minutes. Anay Shah (00:20:49): Well, you had to figure out who had the middle seat in Row 17. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:52): Who had the middle seat, exactly. Anay Shah (00:20:54): How were you going to figure that out without looking up the card? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:56): As American Airlines scaled to a real operational scale, it started to break down. So, they reached out to IBM, and they kicked off this project that would be known as Sabre. It was essentially a commercial version of the SAGE system. Two IBM mainframes were purpose-built, and would be connected over phone lines. Those systems would house the source of truth around the reservations. And there would be terminals. These weren't terminals with screens; these were terminals with paper where you'd still have a travel agent, but they would be querying over the terminal what seats were available. And things would be booked automatically. So, it would go from 90 minutes to seconds at a terminal. And it removed the clerk in the middle. This set the stage for e-commerce. This was the first time, I think, you were buying something over a computer. Anay Shah (00:21:44): You had 90 minutes to do a reservation, now down to seconds. And this scaled American Airlines operations by the mid-'60s to be able to do a full 40,000 reservations per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:21:55): Insane. This system continues to this day to be part of the backbone of airline booking. It's quite an amazing foundational moment where commerce is happening between data centers. And so, they were running airlines; they were doing these major government projects. Businesses were now buying the 1401 machine off the shelves. But there was a different problem. Entering the mid-'60s, all of these mainframes had their own accessories. There was no compatibility. So, in 1964, they launched the System/360. And that turned this chaotic, messy, ad hoc world of different mainframe models into a platform. It was essentially one architecture; you could choose how powerful you wanted... Anay Shah (00:22:38): it to be, buy your base package, and then feature it up based on what you need. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:42): That's right. And so, for facility planners, they could now plan a room and a facility, and then be able to scale up the machine as needed. I believe roughly $5 billion of investment in R&D was spent in this era. Anay Shah (00:22:55): Another "bet the company" moment. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:57): And it worked. They were shipping thousands per month of these devices in the '60s. And so, if you zoom out and look across the '50s and '60s, as we talked about earlier. From the '50s to '62, they scaled to $2.6 billion. By 1970, they were doing $7.5 billion in annual revenue and had a team of 270,000 employees. Anay Shah (00:23:19): In today's dollars, that's $62 billion in revenue. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:23:23): And the market noticed. IBM was king at that moment. In 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8% of the total U.S. stock market. It almost feels like an unprecedented thing to say that today Nvidia is currently 7% of the U.S. stock market. Anay Shah (00:23:44): These mainframes became part of the zeitgeist. They became part of a cultural milieu because they were often nicknamed "the glass houses." You'd have the mainframes and their operators in an enclosed room. And as we mentioned before, you'd have windows and glass walls around it because you wanted to show off how automated your systems were, how advanced your company was. There was a recognition that these "glass houses"—these mainframes—were powering the billions of dollars of revenue from their enterprise customers. And so, the security, the operational control, the climate control, and cleanliness... It was all part of this cultural moment where mainframes and these early data centers became a meaningful part of how our society and economy ran. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:24:34): If any company was using it effectively, they had more demand for use than they had supply for the computer. And so, oftentimes, people would be sitting there waiting for their information to come back, for their computation to run. Sometimes it would be a day or longer, so the utilization was pretty high. But there was this long interactive latency problem. And an invention that echoes through in multiple ways to this day changed the fundamental way that computing was thought of: from this single-threaded "I'm only working on one problem at once" to "No." The job is to make sure my hardware is as utilized as possible. As a machine, I don't care whether or not it's the same problem from the same person. I just need to be calculating. Anay Shah (00:25:20): I need to be operating all the time to utilize my capacity. It can be for this problem; it can be for that problem. You can slot them in and out; it doesn't matter. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:29): That's right. And so, a team at MIT in the early '60s developed what was called CTSS, the Compatible Time-Sharing System, and turned it onto the campus in 1963. And so, students could sit there with electric typewriters and interact with this machine, multiple users at the same time, and feel like they had control over the computer. Anay Shah (00:25:52): It felt like it was your own. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:53): And this was a huge moment. This was the first time there were logins, users, files, and instant feedback. And so, it was revelatory to be there in the mid-'60s, experiencing that after the idea of a computer was just this operated thing by someone else. Anay Shah (00:26:09): That's right. You had to queue up, get in line, hand over your data to the operators—the specialists—who would then go and do their thing, and you would sit and wait. Now you're interacting. It's you and the computer. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:26:22): And the way this worked was that you didn't obviously have monopoly control over the computer. The computer was switching what problem it was working on, depending on what free cycles it had. The human perception is, "Oh, how can a computer do that?" Well, the computer is operating at a much faster frequency than we're able to realize. Even if it's something as simple as responding to a keystroke, there are plenty of milliseconds in between my keystroke and your keystroke for the computer to respond and then switch back to the other problem. And as we'll see later in this story, this notion of intelligently slicing up the hardware and utilizing it becomes the backbone of everything in how the cloud and data centers are architected today. And it started with this timesharing innovation. Well, we had these mainframes that had taken over the business world, and timesharing. So, multiple people could be on a campus connected to that mainframe, feeling like they had their own computer. They were still fully disconnected from anyone else in the world. They were still islands onto themselves. So yes, now on this island, multiple people could be there, but it's not like you could go visit the next-door island. What are we missing? Anay Shah (00:27:27): It's something we take quite for granted. Many people in different places, but working on the same system at the same time. Now remember, we are in the late 1950s, in the Cold War, and Eisenhower wanted to ensure that the U.S. would not be blindsided by a technological surprise. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:27:47): There's this particular moment right when everyone looked up in the sky and for the first time, a man-made thing was floating in space, and that's Sputnik. The fact that the Russians beat us to the skies with Sputnik kicked off, I think, a level of panic from a geopolitical standpoint that's hard to connect to today. Anay Shah (00:28:07): And so, after the panic of Sputnik, Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA. And in those years, ARPA was pouring money into space, into missiles, into computing. And we wanted to ensure, in this nuclear-armed world, that weapons could not destroy a centralized command system. And so, the network itself needed to be decentralized. This need to ensure reliability combined with a slightly more mundane problem that Bob Taylor faced when he was at his office in the Pentagon: he was working at three terminals. He had one machine connected to MIT, another connected to UC Berkeley, and a third for a different research system altogether. And he could talk to any of them, but never at the same time. So he was rolling his chair back and forth, and he's quoted saying, "We ought to find a way to connect all of these different machines." He told his boss. After a 20-minute meeting, Taylor walked out with a million-dollar budget and a simple mandate: to make it happen. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:29:10): And we won't go into every moment and step because the ARPANET itself is quite a story. But I think a couple of innovations set the stage for the Internet in a really important way. One is the concept of packet switching. If you think about a phone line, AT&T built its whole business on this idea: you're going to connect a phone call between two people, and there's going to be a circuit that connects those two phones together. This is called circuit switching. But there's this crazy idea: if you want that resilient system so that if one node goes out, the next thing doesn't go out, you need to route things around in different ways and not be dependent on the one route you have. So, you need to have more of a spiderweb-like network to say, "Well, from here to here, there are actually five, or ideally 50 or 5,000, ways to get between those two points." And to do that, you need a flexible communication system. And so, the idea is to break up information into packets—little pieces of mail that would get sent from one node to another. Different packets could even take different routes, but on the other side, someone would reassemble them into the message. Anay Shah (00:30:15): It's the same singular message, broken up into many, many different pieces and routed through many, many different pathways. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:30:24): It's funny, I hadn't thought about this until we connected to the timesharing story, but it's actually about better utilization of the network. In a circuit-switched mode, you have this direct line; you and I have a direct line together, and you have a direct line to someone else. That line is usually empty. It's pretty hard to fully utilize and build out the circuit-switched thing because the phone call ends, and you think, "Okay, now it's just sitting there unused." In packet switching, packets are finding their way through this wild world. So, a lot of skepticism obviously came from AT&T, which said, "If you want to have two computers talk to each other, we'll build the phone lines, and you can run them." But a crack team that had kind of spun out of MIT—this company, Bolt, Baranek and Newman—latched onto this packet switching model and ran forward. And the core thing that they needed to build was what was called the Interface Message Processor, or IMP. This was ultimately the router that would sit in front of the host machine. Universities like MIT and Berkeley would have these mainframes. But to connect those machines together, there would need to be these nodes that would sit in front of them and be able to build this network. And so, BBN used a Honeywell minicomputer that was fridge-sized, cost about $80,000, and built the logic around packet switching and rolled this out. There were a lot of engineering heroics that went into getting the first machine ready. But then it was time. Anay Shah (00:31:47): Almost 55 years ago, a small group of grad students gathered at UCLA to wait for the machine to be rolled off the truck, champagne in hand, and were able to celebrate the arrival of the first IMP. The second one was delivered to Stanford weeks later. And the prophetic first message, as the story goes, was meant to be "login," right? You now have users that can log in, but after inputting the first two letters, it crashed. And so, the first message was simply "lo," "lo." Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:19): So close to "lol." And, of course, what is a network with two connections? Pretty limited. But then they rolled out UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah, and then they were just rolling out new IMPs to the large universities, month over month. Anay Shah (00:32:34): And these became nodes—almost a new node every month. And then every new node that came on the network amplified the value. Because now it's not just bidirectional communication; it's multilateral communication. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:47): So, they were building all this logic to do the resilient routing, to do the discovery of devices, and everything that you needed to do that. And of course, the original pitch was, "Hey, we've funded as a government all these expensive computers at all these research universities. Let's drive utilization." Maybe one team has a special program for doing something; another team has a special program for doing something. Let's let the departments connect. Anay Shah (00:33:07): One unexpected application really bubbled to the top that the researchers discovered. Quick, asynchronous messages were often more valuable than logging into someone else's system to run the code. And in 1972, ARPA's Bob Kahn said, "Everyone really uses this thing for electronic mail." And the network's purpose had quietly shifted from sharing machines to connecting people in the form of email. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:33:36): It's wild how as soon as you have enough connectivity, it's always the killer app. The killer app is always people communicating at a distance. Anay Shah (00:33:45): That's right. People wanting to do what we are biologically programmed to do, which is connect with other humans. And as sophisticated as these machines were, it was the simple act of asynchronous communication that became the killer app. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:02): And more people wanted it. There were new ways to connect within your local network over these terminals, so then you could connect into the broader network. It was no longer just about wanting access to a terminal to access the machine on your campus; it was about wanting a terminal so you could email your friends at the other campus. Sounds like an early social network that we'll get to later. And so the expansion continued. By 1972, there were 29 nodes. By 1975, over 50. Anay Shah (00:34:27): And some of these connections weren't just from university to university. We were now leaping oceans. It was clumsy, but we were able to go over the Atlantic Ocean from a node in Virginia to the one in Cornwall, England. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:41): There was some story where they came back from some conference in England and someone had left their electric shaver behind. Anay Shah (00:34:47): It was the middle of the night, so in England it was 3 o'clock in the morning. But he knew that his colleague was a workaholic, so he sent off a message at 3 o'clock in the morning, England time, to see if this person was awake. And he was. He saw that he was logged on and he's like, "Hey, did I leave my electric razor there?" Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:35:01): "Can you get my razor, please?" And it all worked. It was phenomenal. So, by the early 1980s, other research networks started to pop up in the US and elsewhere. People were like, "Oh, this ARPANET thing is pretty cool. We're going to build our own." There was DECnet, there was an IBM Net, there were various nets that companies and other research groups started to stand up. They had a new challenge: "We want to talk to everyone on any of these networks, and how are we going to do that?" And these IMPs were not designed for that. They had presumed there was only one network they were trying to build out. And so Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were involved in ARPANET, figured out what they needed to build was a common language to figure out addressing: where to send a packet of mail. And then also, the control protocol for sending information, to make sure duplicate packets weren't sent. And so this became TCP/IP: TCP for the Transmission Control Protocol, and IP for the Internet Protocol. You can think of IP as solving the addressing problem. You might be familiar with your IP address, which then communicates through routers what you're looking for, and who you're trying to get the packet to. And then TCP is the reliable way that a packet gets acknowledged. "Hey, this little chunk of information has arrived." It's like certified mail. Anay Shah (00:36:16): Like signing for my package. I have an address, so the package knows where to go. And then I signed for it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:36:21): "And I don't need you to send me the package again, because I got it." And so this combination became the backbone for connecting all of these networks together, and ultimately the backbone for the next stage of not the ARPANET, but the Internet – a network of networks. In 1983, they took every ARPANET host and said they needed to move to TCP/IP. That switch, on January 1, 1983, became the framework for the modern-day internet: many networks, all speaking the same language, able to connect. Anay Shah (00:36:54): And that's where we have the advent of the .com, .edu, and .gov, because we now had standard protocols for multiple nets to communicate together. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:06): 20.3.1.72 doesn't have the same ring as pets.com. Anay Shah (00:37:11): Pets.com, an important one, but we're not quite there yet. No, but by the mid-1980s, as Ben mentioned, there were multiple nets now connected. And ARPANET itself was showing its age. By 1990, it became apparent that the ARPANET needed to be decommissioned. But the work it had done, the ideas of decentralized networking, packet switching, and open protocols had firmly taken root. Research institutions and large organizations had firmly established how to exchange messages. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:41): So they were able to send files back and forth, maybe send each other's research papers and data sets. But this was not a thing with a web browser yet. We needed a structure around documents. And so Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN in Switzerland, proposed the document structure that would become the application-layer infrastructure of the World Wide Web. Anay Shah (00:38:01): And so the network that started off as a Cold War research project in response to looking up at the sky and seeing the Russians launch Sputnik, had now become the public and commercial Internet – an open highway for data, and the foundation upon which we would build the modern data center economy. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:38:18): So we now have this expanding network, but the computing on this network was still this terminal-based interaction between a terminal and a mainframe that then connected to the network, or a terminal and a minicomputer which connected to the network. And I think it's worth saying a bit more about minicomputers, which were both what became that IMP device and also a primary source of connection. These were not something that you'd buy for your house. They still were the cost of maybe a car when they first came out, but they were much more accessible than a big IBM mainframe, a room-sized computer. And so the company, Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, launched the first minicomputers in the mid-60s. A lot of what innovated on the minicomputer was software like Unix, C programming, and sockets, and all these foundational innovations that would later echo through to today. But there was room for a computer that a normal person could buy. Anay Shah (00:39:11): On one fateful day, January 1975, the cover of Popular Electronics magazine showcased the Altair 8800, a machine you could buy at home for $439, or $1,500 souped up, to run your own code. And there were a few hobbyists that went to the newsstand and picked up this magazine. Two in particular saw the cover and decided to do something about it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:39:42): And so Bill Gates and Paul Allen, famously, when they were at Lakeside High School in Seattle, they had access to a computer and a terminal, and they would spend hours and hours programming. But that's different than having one in your own house that you can play with. And so when they saw this come out, it was immediately clear that this was a moment when computing had gotten cheap enough that a normal person could afford their own personal computer, or PC. Anay Shah (00:40:06): And you could see that if the first one was released at $450, it was only a matter of time before that would become accessible to more and more people. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:16): Microsoft formed immediately to sell a BASIC compiler for this device. The Apple II launched in 1977, which kicked off the PC wave for many folks, and it paired with VisiCalc in 1979. So, all of a sudden, you had a killer app – a spreadsheet – that wasn't just for home use, but now had a corporate function, driving the purchase of these PCs. And so someone could model a budget without needing to connect to the mainframe down the hall. Anay Shah (00:40:43): I can stay at my desk and run my finance operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:47): That's right. And IBM, while not the first here, was actually pretty quick to realize there was a problem for them. Right. If everyone is doing all the computation on their desk, they're not going to need the mainframe down the hall anymore. The glass house had been shattered. So they kicked off a skunkworks project. It was actually pretty amazing. They isolated it outside of the New York region, down in Boca Raton. They said this team would use off-the-shelf parts to design an IBM PC. In 1981, they built and launched the IBM PC, and they licensed MS-DOS from Microsoft, which had been founded six years earlier, as the core operating system. They thought hardware was the business, but time would show them to be incorrect. A bunch of IBM-compatible devices, including Compaq and others, flooded the market through the 80s. So prices fell. Hardware became a commodity, and Microsoft, with DOS and then Windows, became the Wintel duopoly that ultimately took the mindshare and market from IBM. Anay Shah (00:42:00): That's amazing. You got Lotus 1-2-3 dominating spreadsheets. You've got WordPerfect. I remember using that for word processing. And then Microsoft comes along and says, "I'm going to bundle all this into Office" and really took the cake. So productivity was through the roof, and we were able to do more personally than we could ever do before. And the way we collaborated? It was that magic floppy disk. We were able to hand that back and forth and keep on rolling. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:21): And that's great, right? Until it's not. Anay Shah (00:42:24): Until it's not. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:25): You want to work with someone across a big building? You're going to run them a floppy disk? And what if they have a different version? It's a mess. I think the "personal" in personal computing started to become a hindrance here. So we needed to connect these devices as well. Enter the invention of Ethernet and IBM's Token Ring, which wired the floors and connected these PCs into a corporate network. And a new set of companies emerged. Novell, building NetWare, actually turned a server into a hub for shared disks and printers. You had a PC on your desk, and if there was a printer room and you wanted to print, you'd have a different computer. That was a specialized PC that we'd call a server, connected to that printer or to shared storage. Now we were able to access files and print over a network. A whole company, Novell – which at some point was actually the second-largest software manufacturer after Microsoft – Anay Shah (00:43:23): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:23): was booming in this era. Microsoft, doing what they do very well, responded by building a network-connected operating system – eventually Windows NT and other services – so that you could do it all within Microsoft's ecosystem. Anay Shah (00:43:37): So throughout our conversations, a lot of the OGs in this industry pointed to this moment as the introduction of the client-server era. What does that mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:46): It means an application was really split in two. You had your computer sitting there on your desk running as the client and accessing a central database or a server in the back room. A bunch of technologies came up to support this, from Unix servers to ERP systems to Windows NT. But now, all of a sudden, you would think about an application as networked from design, where you'd have local client software that could use the best capabilities of the local PC, connected to the server. Not across the world, but the server in the server room, on site. Anay Shah (00:44:20): What was that server down the hall or in the other room or across the world? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:44:25): Most notably, this was the era when the architecture of the personal computer was adopted. This included the x86 (Intel-based) architecture or the Sun workstation architecture. Increasingly, those would become the servers that could run these applications. This was a notable shift, again, from the IBM mainframe era. It got to the point where someone selling your company an application would sell you an appliance, which was really a package of the software and the hardware together. So you ended up with a sprawl of different appliances that were being managed, all serving different functions, all written with their own bespoke software and operating systems. So, while the functionality was amazing, people became very inefficient. Anay Shah (00:45:10): Up until this point, there was a culture and an ethos among data processing professionals that put conservation as the highest ethical principle. To waste a CPU cycle or a byte of memory was embarrassing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:23): I think part of it was that they had gotten cheap enough; these servers, which would have been $10,000 a month to rent just 10 or 15 years prior, had now gotten cheap enough. And it wasn't unreasonable to have them sitting there idle at the same time. In a macro sense, this inefficiency later created the space and value for the evolution of time-sharing into virtualization, where we asked, "Why can't we run these applications on one box? Why do they all need their own box sitting there waiting for a command?" Anay Shah (00:45:49): That's right. If a box was not being maximally utilized by a single client, share the box. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:56): We will do a whole episode on how that came to be. But this was still an era of deep innovation, particularly concerning redundancy. You had RAID arrays, which provided redundant storage, and backup tape libraries that were off-site, because you still had these massive points of failure. Your company server, which might be your system of record for your customers, was sitting there in the closet. I heard from someone who ran some of it at REI at one point that they had a flood near their headquarters, and they were like, "Well, the website's going to go down, we're going to lose all this business." So this model was not designed for scale and redundancy in a major way. So, to make this moment concrete – of just how computing power and connectivity was starting to shift – let's talk about a deeply innovative retail company that, no, is not Amazon. We're talking about the OGs of major retail and scale. It's Walmart. Anay Shah (00:46:50): That's right. So, you're at the register at your neighborhood Walmart location: you scan the toothpaste, the barcode beeps. Within seconds, a satellite dish behind the store sends that transaction to the sky and over to Bentonville, Arkansas, where they're hosting their mainframe computer to record the sale. A few minutes later, a massive data warehouse would update how many tubes of toothpaste you had just bought. Then, perhaps before the end of the day, Procter & Gamble's factory would receive an update that they needed to make more toothpaste. This was the cutting edge of retail in the late 80s, and Walmart made a massive decision to take this a step further, truly driving innovation across the retail industry. They invested $24 million to build their own private satellite network linking all Walmart stores to headquarters. This was fairly unprecedented at the time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:47:43): It was the largest private satellite network. Anay Shah (00:47:46): That had been built, and it created a unified, real-time machine. So any single event that happened within the Walmart ecosystem rode on this private network, enabling them to mine their data in a way that was unheard of before. By mining their sales data – which could now be collected in real time across all Walmart stores over their private satellite network – they discovered that when hurricanes approached, the sale of Pop-Tarts increased 7x over their normal rate. Having spent a summer working in Bentonville, Arkansas, I can tell you this is deep in their DNA. They are constantly looking at signals like this. Specifically, they discovered that it was the Strawberry Pop-Tart that was most in demand before a storm. This led to the legendary insight of meteorologists predicting a severe weather event, and Walmart stocking their affected stores with pallets of Strawberry Pop-Tarts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:48:43): It makes me wonder if the reverse is possible. It's like, instead of checking the weather, you go to Walmart to see if the Strawberry Pop-Tarts are there, because it's such a reliable system. Like, I know that they're watching the weather, but I mean, there's some crazy innovation here. Both the satellite link, and then Walmart, supposedly, was the owner of the first commercial 1-terabyte enterprise data warehouse they built with a company called Teradata. They were just maniacal about making sure all the sales and customer data flowed into one place. By 2001, just nine years later, that one-terabyte warehouse had grown to 70 terabytes. Anay Shah (00:49:14): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:15): Right. So this was just an explosion of connectivity inside the enterprise, even while there was the personal computer. Some people had fun with their computers at home. I remember playing on an IBM XT as a kid, and some early programming and early games. It was not like most people had a real personal use case. We're still talking about a corporate-centered world. So we talked about the rise of PCs and the growing client-server LAN inside a company. We talked about these data centers; we talked about Walmart's satellite network. But what was happening now, going into the early 90s, with this whole ARPANET/NSFNET Internet thing? What was happening outside the office? Anay Shah (00:49:55): Yeah, and perhaps what was happening under the ground. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:58): So the first network that was available to all these researchers was the evolution of this into the NSFNET. It became the de facto US internet backbone. Anay Shah (00:50:07): This network was connecting 2,000 computers in 1986 and expanded to over 2 million by 1993. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:15): It was no longer just researchers who wanted to do stuff with it. So, the design and topology was a high-speed national backbone that had, at this point, gone to a T3 line (at 45 Mbps) that connected a small number of regional networks. So, kind of like a central hub-and-spoke model. These regional networks would then connect to universities, labs, and nonprofits. But this was not designed for commercial scale. Anay Shah (00:50:39): In fact, it was prohibited, according to their terms of use, to have commercial traffic running on that backbone. It was specifically designed for research, education, and government data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:50): So, I think some private commercial network could happen inside just a regional hub, but not across that whole big backbone. So you did not have the beginnings of what could be a commercial internet. If two regional networks – say, New York and Philadelphia – wanted to connect, they had to flow back up to that NSFNET backbone. There was no neutral point where they could connect and exchange. So this was the moment when commercial ISPs and telcos started to see, "Okay, this internet thing is interesting, this packet-switched model." People wanted to do new things with this. Maybe it was trying to get out of the lab into commercial use. How were we going to connect? What were we going to do? Anay Shah (00:51:29): In 1992, a group of network providers were sitting in Virginia, drinking a beer, and decided to connect their networks outside of Tysons Corner. This specific group of engineers was from Metropolitan Fiber Systems, the local telco. They chose Tysons Corner outside of Washington D.C. because there was a dense network of defense contractors and early providers, which were heavy users of the current internet. They famously set up in a repurposed parking garage to become the de facto on-ramp for new ISPs. When you think about an important hub, you wouldn't typically think of a parking garage, but it was the right place at the right time. It turned into what was called Metropolitan Area Exchange East – East Coast. So MAE-East is what formed. And if you connected into MAE-East, that meant you had the internet at your doorstep. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:27): This became the hub for the internet. If someone sent an email from London to Paris, it most likely went through MAE-East. Anay Shah (00:52:35): Within a couple of years, roughly half the world's internet packets were flowing across the MAE-East parking garage. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:43): And I think this is something we'll see again and again, which is that the Internet forms around hubs. It's not always obvious why that became the hub specifically, other than it did first. And there's just this gravitational pull of connectivity. This wasn't new to the Internet; this was something that we saw with telcos. There's this concept called carrier hotels. You're in a city like New York, and you had two different carriers that were trying to connect with each other, right? Think Sprint and AT&T. Instead of having to connect all throughout the city in multiple spots, they would all show up in a neutral zone called a carrier hotel and build their connectivity infrastructure there. Anay Shah (00:53:21): You'd be able to tap into each other's long-haul routes, their local fiber routes, without having to build their own intercity footprints individually. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:53:31): And so May east was the first sort of flavor of this, where they would all come in and connect. Ultimately, a device — think a switch — that is connecting. Okay, you're coming in, plugging in your ISP traffic; here I'm plugging in mine. Now users across our ISPs can connect, and it's just one big switch room. The problem is, the Internet is scaling, and you don't necessarily want to all be bottlenecked on one switch. It's not the most secure thing. And if you're, I don't know, eventually building a video streaming service or you make a deal between two ISPs, you don't necessarily want everyone else to be in on that deal. And so you saw the evolution of this model to a different model that became known as MeetMe rooms. These are neutral physical rooms where an ISP or someone trying to hook into an ISP can provide their boxes and their connectivity, and then those two can connect directly. Anay Shah (00:54:20): So, a bring-your-own-box method. Instead of everyone connecting through the existing box, you BYO your box for the deal you want to do in the private MeetMe room. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:30): That's right. Something sounds funny about BYO to the private MeetMe room, but we're talking about ISPs connecting for data. Anay Shah (00:54:38): The farthest thing from a non-platonic conversation as you could be. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:44): And so, sure enough, this all worked. The NSF kind of officially sanctioned this method and designated these NAP points — Network Access Points. The first one, May east. They designated Sprint to run a NAP in New Jersey near the transatlantic cable landing points, one in Chicago, and one in San Francisco. Then they eventually added Mae west in San Jose. Anay Shah (00:55:06): And these MeetMe room models started to take off. The carrier hotels, you had One Wilshire, a large building on the west side of Los Angeles, which were law offices, and gave way to a single floor that could host hundreds of carrier routers and thousands of cross-connects, eventually making it one of the most valuable space per square foot on the entire West Coast. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:29): It's so funny. It's like this ugly building or just relatively nondescript architecture, and you're like, "What's going on in there?" Law offices make sense. And now this is where the West Coast Internet is coming through. Anay Shah (00:55:40): That's right. And we'll talk a little bit later about undersea cables, but they come in and want to find their shortest path to One Wilshire. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:48): And the business model was pretty genius for this. These telco hotels, these MeetMe rooms, ultimately provided power, cooling, and cross-connect, and they would charge rent. The dot-com boom to come would boost this model to new heights. Anay Shah (00:56:03): And it provided an elastic infrastructure that Internet companies in the dot-com boom and after could leverage, including, as we'll see soon, hyperscalers, where you could flexibly increase and decrease your capacity because they were specialized in providing all the necessary infrastructure to host the connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:25): So all of this infrastructure being set up to commercialize the Internet, to provide a scalable backbone, to enable the private market of ISPs and telcos and others to invest in making the Internet faster. And we now have the World Wide Web. The NSF has actually funded a little project called Mosaic, which is the first user-friendly web browser. We have personal computing. Enter the mid-90s and the dot-com boom. Anay Shah (00:56:53): Let's boom! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:54): The ISPs are ready to build the network. All we need are the users. Anay Shah (00:57:00): And boy, are they coming! In May of 1995, Bill Gates writes the famous Internet tidal wave memo: "The Internet is the single most important development to come along since the IBM PC." And it was that same year that Netscape went public. Why was Netscape so significant, Ben? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:57:21): I think it's significant for two reasons. One is it kicked off the accessibility of the Internet. It turned the Internet from this network for researchers to share files to this browser that you could download, install, and access the web, opening all of that up. And then it was that from a product perspective. But that also captured the economic perspective and interest: "Is there a thing here? Is there a new industry, a boom that you can make your millions or billions off of?" Its journey from founding to IPO in such a short cycle kicked off a mania. Anay Shah (00:57:56): It kicked off another mania in the business world, which was: having barely any revenue or profits, you could hit a multi-billion dollar valuation, which is what they did. And the web exploded. You had 23,000 websites in 1995 to over 10 million by the year 2000. Global users climbed to over 350 million. Nasdaq tripled in two years. If you put a dot-com at the end of your name, just kind of like you put 'AI' at the end of your name today, you could raise millions on an idea and a slide deck. And in 1999 alone, you had more than 400 Internet companies going public, pulling in $40 billion. What a liquid IPO market that we could only dream of! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:58:40): Today Microsoft hits all-time highs in the stock market. The energy was manic, right? Founders in their 20s would become paper millionaires overnight. Engineers were hopping jobs for stock options. This is the rise of the Aeron chair, the foosball tables, and the new economy where the rules of things like revenue no longer apply to business. Anay Shah (00:58:59): But it wasn't just applications; it was infrastructure as well. Carriers spent half a trillion dollars on fiber and wireless. You had these colocation companies expanding at breakneck speed. This company called Exodus Communications was the world's largest web hosting provider at the time, providing server colocation. Its revenue went from 12 million in 1997 to 250 million two years later. It peaked at a $32 billion market cap three years after that. It was laying the infrastructure in the ground and building the applications above it in a period of unprecedented growth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:37): And so to launch a startup, you had to build a site, a service, and a database. You needed money way ahead of time to buy the servers to stick in the colo box. Anay Shah (00:59:48): Wait, so you're saying, in order for me to launch a web business, I had to buy hardware? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:53): Exactly. You had to take most of your venture capital dollars and spend it on servers even before you knew if anyone wanted to go to your website to begin with. Anay Shah (01:00:02): So you couldn't test your idea out, you couldn't A/B test, you couldn't do a landing page that drew in a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:07): waitlist, couldn't do any of that. Anay Shah (01:00:09): Wow, what a different world! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:11): So all these new servers are trying to run on the new backbones that are being laid to power this boom. The traffic still at this point met at only a handful of public exchange points. Networks are plugged into these shared boxes at places like May east that we just talked about. That can only scale for so long. Anay Shah (01:00:30): You'd start to hit choke points, and May east, one of the earliest network access points, became one of those major choke points. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:38): We needed different models for companies, ISPs, non-ISPs, to connect. You had DEC kicking off Palo Alto with the Palo Alto Internet Exchange, a non-telco neutral spot. Then you had the founding of Equinix where they took that model and scaled it with their first site in Ashburn, Virginia. Anay Shah (01:00:59): Ashburn is the Wall Street for data centers. In 1999, Equinix launches their first data center under this new model in Ashburn, Virginia, right next to May east, the choke point. But the original network access point isn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:01:13): This, near D.C.? I've never been there. Have you been to Loudoun? Anay Shah (01:01:16): I grew up right outside of D.C. on the other side of the river. Loudoun county is on the Virginia side. It's rural farmland. It's past Dulles Airport. There's really nothing there. But it's proximal to a large East Coast population, the undersea cables and May East. And you actually had AOL choose Loudoun county in the mid-90s to set up a huge dial-up campus. So they laid fresh fiber and drew even more carriers into the region. And May east had grown so large it outgrew the parking garage it was in. So the Exchange relocated to Ashburn. So you've got this unassuming farmland outside of Dulles Airport. And it was really catalyzed by a couple things. Outside of AOL pioneering the new site, it was policy-led. So Loudoun county ruled that data centers could be treated like ordinary office parks. They eliminated all these special use hearings and provided incredible tax breaks over time to attract data centers into this network. Coupled with that, Dominion Energy, seeing what was coming ahead, offered some of the lowest industrial rates to string high-voltage lines to this empty land to bring power and fiber together to create the new data center model which Equinix pioneered in Ashburn and became the largest Internet hub on planet Earth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:02:42): So it's the combination of perhaps for a moment, cheap land (not so much anymore), fiber and connectivity, cheap and accessible power, and favorable policy. One interesting policy story that I heard on this: Apple was looking for where to put a new site in the late 2000s, 2009. Apple's obviously building more services, needing more storage, and building more data centers. So they run a process, and it turns out that North Carolina gives them a better deal. So Virginia fights back and in reaction passes major tax breaks to say that if you're building a data center, basically if you're building anything more than $150 million of investment, you're going to employ more than 50 people — no tax. Anay Shah (01:03:22): You, of course, are. If you're building a data center, of course. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:03:24): Of course. Yeah, you can't build a data center for $150 million. Anay Shah (01:03:27): Local policy, as you mentioned, is so important. Federal policy actually played a big role here. In 1996, we passed the Telecommunications Act. And one of the main things it did was force the incumbent telcos — which were regional monopolies from the AT&T breakup — to lease their physical network (their copper pairs, their fiber) to their competitors. So prior to this, a data center was a private enterprise tied to a single carrier because the carriers only used their own fiber. Now it enabled carrier-neutral sites. So you could become a tenant of a data center and choose from multiple fibers provided into that building. And it opened up an explosion of choice for tenants and for this carrier-neutral model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:11): And so this is a flywheel of a deregulation environment to build this because once they have the tax incentives in, it becomes a major source of economic prosperity for the region. Now, we'll fast forward later on in the story to today, and maybe hitting some of the first real pushback. Anay Shah (01:04:27): And similar to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo, the biggest hubs are where you can find cables and carriers and connect the most networks with the least amount of friction possible. And it's this flywheel that continues to make Ashburn the largest home of data centers in the U.S. And what a time! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:47): In the first six months of 1995, Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days. The telcos were convinced that you couldn't overbuild. You just needed all the fiber you could put down. Anay Shah (01:04:56): WorldCom and these other telcos, they just poured billions into this. And the idea of overbuilding — not possible, particularly in this Internet boom, right? But by 2000, how much of that installed fiber was actually being used? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:11): It was only about 3% — 3% was lit up. So they just laid down fiber, the shards of glass that were just sitting there empty. Anay Shah (01:05:19): So to give you a sense of the amount of fiber miles laid during this period, you could go around the circumference of the Earth 5,000 times. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:27): Wow. So this was all over land, right? But how would you connect to Europe? Anay Shah (01:05:31): Ah, and that overbuild, you're right, was not just limited to land. Nearly all intercontinental Internet traffic rides on undersea cables, which I'd kind of heard of, but I didn't really have a full appreciation for the fact that bundles of glass threads are wound into a garden hose structure and laid down on the ocean floor all over the world. So imagine a planet stitched together with hair-thin strands of glass tucked into an armored hose and laid across the darkest parts of the ocean. That's the undersea cable system, and it's the real physical Internet that connects the continents. So 99% of international data still rides on these cables, not satellites. That's racing pulses of light through fibers thinner than the human hair. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:23): The story arguably starts way back in the 1850s, when we had the first telegraph cables crossing the Atlantic. They brought those across steamships and landed the first link in 1866, able to send news for the first time across the ocean. Anay Shah (01:06:38): So instead of weeks, you could get the news in minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:41): Yeah, you're not sending the news via ship, you're sending it via electrons. Anay Shah (01:06:44): Amazing! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:45): Fast forward to 1988, and we land the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable. It runs between the U.S., the U.K., and France, and it kicks off this new era of cross-continental capacity. By the late 90s, as this boom was happening, you can imagine the funding routes going into wiring all of this up. Anay Shah (01:07:07): You lay all this cable down with specialized cable ships that survey the seabed, unspool the cable, and then near shore they bury it underneath to protect it from anchors and storms, and then raise it up through some nondescript concrete box. This garden hose has optical repeaters that boost the light every 50-100 km, so you can sprint thousands of miles without fading. Then you get to land, and these concrete bunkers have the cable hop up into terrestrial fiber and then run straight to your One Wilshire or any of your nearby hubs that then connect you onward. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:07:44): What a wild thing. You have a garden hose-shaped thing moving all this data. What do we actually mean? Well, modern cable, as an example, one laid in 2018, can move 250 terabits per second. To conceptualize that, you can send 6,000 HD movies in one second, or about 20% of global internet traffic can go in one garden hose. How is this working? Well, at the beginning of using fiber optics, you would shine a laser down and blink your zeros and ones. But we've moved from doing that with one wavelength to doing what's called wavelength division multiplexing. That's a fancy way of saying we use the rainbow; we're using multiple. Usually, it's around 80 to 120 different colors that can go down the same cable at the same time. The other thing is we've added more fibers. So instead of there being a pair of fibers, we now have up to 12 to 16 pairs of fibers. And then the last thing is called coherent optics. This is a way of modulating the amplitude of the light. So instead of it just being on and off, you can actually have multiple steps. All of this adds up to today, probably 250-300 terabits maximum capacity in one hose. There are hundreds of hoses around the world. And I think the other thing that's really cool about this is the thing that was laid was the glass. We keep increasing the capacity of the glass because the glass is the glass—resilient infrastructure. It's kind of like railroads. It's like we're still using the tracks. Anay Shah (01:09:07): From long ago, even if the engine gets upgraded. And just like we've been talking about with this network effect, when you bring more networks in, it increases the value and the speed. And so that's a big reason why Ashburn, as we talked about, hardened. Once hundreds of carriers and thousands of cross-connects land into a single place, moving it is impossible. And so if you need to reach Europe fast from the East Coast, you're going to colocate where the undersea cable is already coming. You've got New York, New Jersey, Virginia, tying to Cornwall, England, and to Marseille. You've got the Red Sea and the Mediterranean corridor connecting into Djibouti as a critical touch point. You've got Miami as a key touch point into Latin America. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan are key corridors into Asia Pacific. Mombasa and Lagos now light up Africa's East Coast. Hundreds of cables have converged that have connected the entire world. And this then forms the network of data centers that we have built and will continue to build through this story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:16): And so the boom continues, right? Anay Shah (01:10:19): No, there was something like the bust to that boom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:23): That's right. And by 2001, everything collapsed. Advertising folded, startups folded. Exodus, that we talked about earlier, filed for bankruptcy, had nearly $6 billion in debt. PSINet, one of the largest ISPs, had already collapsed. So, was this the death of the internet and the death of the value of all of this fiber that was laid? Clearly not. It was the death of a particular moment and an overbuild and a bubble. But in fact, the actual infrastructure that was built out would prove immensely valuable as services that mattered matured and business models matured. In other words, I'd say the application layer of this era died, but the infrastructure lived on and would eventually thrive. Anay Shah (01:11:03): So the dot-com tide went out. But the overbuilt assets were exactly what we needed for the next chapter. And it included infrastructure that we can't live without. The carrier hotels, the fiber, the data centers, the glass in the ocean didn't disappear. It just changed owners, and there was a fire sale, right? Assets were being sold at a fraction of the cost. A few key actors survived, and a few new ones stepped in. Equinix survived the crash. They doubled down on the real asset that they had, which was interconnection. That neutral meet-me room turned into a marketplace where competitors paid you to be neighbors because the value was in the speed, the reliability, and the flexibility that these carrier hotels provided. Meanwhile, private equity swoops in, as they will in every bust cycle, and reframes the category. So, one in particular buys a couple dozen distressed facilities around the world, turns it into a vehicle called Digital Realty Trust, takes it public as the first pure-play data center REIT, and treats compute space like real estate. These weren't high-tech moonshot assets they were buying. They're bringing patient capital in to standardize the shell, finance it cheaply, and get long leases, which becomes a blueprint for the next two decades of data center buildouts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:12:30): In addition to the sobering economic environment of 2001 from the bust, there was also September 11. These financial institutions were still operating in this moment, having their key servers trading information connectivity with banks in their offices or right near their offices. So when 9/11 happened, the Verizon 140 West Street Central Office, one of the largest telecom hubs in the city, was blasted with debris, and dust flooded the equipment rooms. Tens of thousands of voice and data circuits were knocked offline immediately. Most of those circuits were powering exactly that: brokerages, market data providers, the trading floors, low-latency connectivity to the stock exchange and clearinghouses. So imagine the market is just disconnected now in a flash. And this cascaded. Engineers worked night and day to bring things back online. I was looking into Morgan Stanley's experience. They saw their whole trading system go down. They had a disaster recovery site in New Jersey, but they didn't have the same level of connectivity and data feeds. So it took them a few days. They ran new fiber through building basements, patched hubs into another telco hub that was still operating to restore capacity so they could trade when the stock exchange opened on September 17th. And I think coming out of this, there was a whole reshaping of the data center world to think about resiliency in a new way. I think it showed the physicality in the city of this connectivity right in this moment, where you could take for granted that you could take action on data over there, whether a trade or market data. Anay Shah (01:14:07): And it wasn't enough to have redundancy on another floor in the same neighborhood. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:12): Right. Anay Shah (01:14:12): We had to start thinking about an infrastructure build-out in different locations with different networks, facilities, and routes to really build true resilience and switch over to the point where now, if a data center goes down, there's automatic rerouting, and we don't see those same blips, although it happens from time to time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:31): This early 2000s phase is a real maturing and growing up of the entire industry to realize that these servers and data centers are holding important financial data and need to be treated as such. But meanwhile, in consumer land, there's a glimmer of light, and it's a big one. This is the era that we move from that squeaky, squealy phone modem to broadband. Anay Shah (01:14:55): I remember touring for colleges, and some had Ethernet across the campus, and others didn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:01): I feel like getting broadband to our house was a radically different experience. It was like a different internet. Anay Shah (01:15:08): The image didn't load from top to bottom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:10): Bottom, it would just fly through. And so this is when BitTorrent starts soaring. This is when Skype launches in 2003, and you can actually make VoIP calls. Anay Shah (01:15:18): Oh, Napster was possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:20): World of Warcraft launches in 2004. I remember that, taking the college campus by storm. Early web video products started to come out. Anay Shah (01:15:28): By 2005, you had a billion people online, about 16% of the planet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:35): So all those folks prognosticating with excitement in the late '90s were not wrong. They were just off by five or six years. And so there's also the advent of CDNs. So Akamai's footprint exploded to provide more and more storage and replication and caching at the edge. Anay Shah (01:15:52): And so what exactly does this mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:55): It means at the places where your ISP is connecting, if someone's downloading an image—let's say you load the New York Times on your computer, and someone else does on their computer down the street—you don't both need to go all the way back to the New York Times home server for access to that photo. It's now been cached on a nearby CDN that's directly hooked up to your ISP. Anay Shah (01:16:13): So in the early to mid-2000s, you have the consumer coming back. Applications are flourishing. The internet is becoming a part of the fabric of society. And there are a handful of companies that survived the bust and captured this moment unlike any other. They not only built incredibly large consumer and enterprise businesses, but they actually became critical infrastructure companies that helped build the modern data center world. That is what we're seeing booming today. The place we're going to start with is the best place to buy books: Amazon.com. So whatever book you wanted to... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:16:50): Find, from A to Z. In July 1995, Amazon launches. By '97, they IPO, and by '98, they are no longer just a bookstore. They're on their path to becoming the Everything Store. Now, it was not initially Bezos's and Amazon's intention to become the infrastructure provider of the world. But this high-growth moment of the late '90s set the stage for what they would need to build, not just for themselves, but for everybody. In those early days, they were running expensive, quote, unquote, reliable servers from the likes of DEC. Extremely expensive products—high-margin servers. Now, the problem is Amazon was not a high-margin business. They're trying to go for scale. They're selling things at whatever the cost was to pass through. They are a retailer trying to be the lowest-margin retailer out there. The cheapest way to get your book delivered to your doorstep. Anay Shah (01:17:45): So, running a retail business, they're always... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:17:48): Tight on cash, so spending it on servers stopped making sense. So by 2000, they were spending so much on infrastructure they were worried this was going to bankrupt them. And so they kicked off a big project to rewrite all of Amazon.com onto Linux and to run it on much cheaper HP servers. Anay Shah (01:18:05): And this is when Amazon was famously a huge monolithic codebase. Every new category they launched, they had to work across their entire codebase. And it became this hairball. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:17): By, I think, around 2002, Bezos had had enough of that, and he issued the famous API mandate that internally every team had to expose functionality through hardened, documented service interfaces designed not just to be used by internal teams, but eventually potentially externalizable. Anay Shah (01:18:33): Classic Bezos. There are no exceptions. Every team must communicate through these interfaces. There were no backdoors, no direct threads, no direct linking. It didn't matter what that technology did. It would, without exception, be designed from the ground up to communicate externally to other teams. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:52): And if you didn't do this, what would happen? Anay Shah (01:18:54): If you didn't do this, you were canned. So, in this moment of reboot, it seems like the question that the company's leaders are asking themselves is: How are we able to scale our business like a software business and not like a furniture business? What if compute could scale with demand? And if we can do this for ourselves, why not rent it to the rest of the world? They were on the precipice of not just a technical breakthrough, but a business model breakthrough. Because for decades, running an online business meant these multi-year leases, these expensive servers, and over-provisioning to handle peak demand. And Amazon would go on to flip this on its head and fundamentally change internet businesses by saying you can rent a server by the hour and pay for only what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:19:47): It is both deeply innovative at the time and also funny because we've had decades—a century—of doing this with our electricity bills in our own houses or water bills, right? This is utilities, utilities. You've always just paid for what you use. But what it continually enables is the driving down of cost and better utilization of centralized infrastructure. And Amazon had just lived through this painful period of having to rewrite their software and change their server architecture. And I think it was two things. One is: we never want to go through this again. A. B. No one should have to go through this again. And C, if we start to build the infrastructure for the world, that's going to accrue to our costs and our benefit. And there's going to be a flywheel here, just like any scale economies provider ever experiences. The bigger we get, the better. Anay Shah (01:20:39): That's right. And that utilization is such a key point. So, what happens in March of 2006? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:44): Amazon launches the first real AWS service: S3, or Simple Storage Service. Anay Shah (01:20:51): What does this Simple Storage Service do for me as a small internet business? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:56): It lets anyone put a blob of data on this non-physical disk and access it anywhere in the world. And that sounds simple in the name, but it was shockingly hard to put a blob—whether that was a megabyte, a gigabyte, or a terabyte of data—out there and have everyone around the world be able to access it quickly. Amazon abstracted everything away so that you could do that and just pay a monthly fee. You didn't have to build a server and plug in a hard disk and build another one that copied the data over and all these other things. It just gave you what you need as a developer. Anay Shah (01:21:32): So this enabled me to store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:35): Correct. Anay Shah (01:21:35): A few months later, what did they do? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:37): They launched the Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as EC2. Anay Shah (01:21:41): So I can store, and now you're telling me I can compute. How does this work? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:45): You can compute. And so what EC2 essentially was the ability to spin up computers—servers, as you saw fit. Now, what they were actually letting you spin up is what's called a virtual machine, where you can say, "I want to run Linux," or "I want to run Windows," or "I want to run some SQL Server OS," and I would have this virtual machine where I could deploy that, run it, and run whatever code I need to. And if I need a second machine, I push a button and get a second machine. If I need a third machine, a third machine. And I pay by the hour, by the machine, only for what I'm using. Anay Shah (01:22:16): This is outstanding. So I'm building a business, and I think I'm going to grow fast, but I don't know what traffic I'm going to get next month or in six months. And so I just raised a bunch of VC money. Now you're telling me I don't have to buy these expensive HP and Sun servers, and as I grow, I can just rent more compute and rent more space? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:37): Yeah, not just that, but I think the activation energy here was brought way down. Before there was the challenge of getting a server and getting space and all that. But in this model, now you just put down your corporate card, and you're off and running with the foundational building blocks that you need. Anay Shah (01:22:51): This is the Cambrian explosion for startups. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:53): Key to this is the utilization point. So many startups had bought servers that then never hit full utilization, or we talked about all these appliances sitting in the backroom closet not hitting full utilization. What enabled Amazon to drive utilization? It was the fact that, yes, they gave you a quote-unquote "server" to run your operating system on. They did not give you a server; in reality, they gave you a virtual machine. Not a machine, a virtual machine. Well, what is a virtual machine? A virtual machine is the flavor of the concept of a machine. And this goes back to a company, VMware, that was founded in 1998 by Diane Green and Mendel Rosenblum. Seid and I got to take operating systems in college from Mendel. And then Diane, as we get to later in the story, was running Google Cloud around the time I was leaving Google. So, legends in this field and in this industry. What VMware did is they made it possible to take a normal computer—whether it was a server or a PC, for that matter—and run virtual machines on that computer. And why that's typically hard is a computer is usually made to run one operating system at a time, and that operating system is managing applications and making sure that the computer doesn't crash. Well, if all of a sudden you have multiple machines running on a computer at a time and one does something that you can consider kind of unsafe—right?—that would stall out the machine or do something that they weren't supposed to do, that could break the whole model. But VMware's first product enabled an unchanged Windows and Linux to run side by side on the same x86 box. This accelerated to even more interesting use cases. So you can actually hot-swap VMs on machines at the same time. Let me give you a concrete example here. Let's say you're playing a game on a PC. It was as though all of a sudden, in the snap of a half-second, that game moved to another machine mid-frame. So this was actually designed to be able to hot-swap a virtual machine from one server to the next. Anay Shah (01:24:55): So it didn't matter that you didn't actually have your own server, because your virtual machine could float around as needed. So let's say that you have a hard drive crash. Well, you could have a snapshot running in the background and you could flip over to that one in real time. And so this notion of a virtual machine becomes the backbone for both the utilization point, because one physical server can be used to actually host multiple virtual machines, and a lot of the redundancy and fallback designs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:25:24): And VMware wasn't the only one to do this. Eventually there was the open-source Xen project. That is what Amazon and AWS first used. This kind of thread becomes better and better over time as all the hyperscalers have figured out how to maximally virtualize everything that they do. Anay Shah (01:25:38): And so now, rather than me trying to run my pets.com and ensure that my product is getting to my customer and my website is doing everything... And then when it crashes, me having to stop everything, file the ticket, and pause business to fix the crash—that's just abstracted out to the specialists, to a business that is designed to solve this problem for me. And all I get then is continuous production, continuous service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:08): And it gets cheaper for you every year. Anay Shah (01:26:10): It gets cheaper. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:11): The cost of S3 and EC2 has just gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. It's an amazing business. And for many others, as we'll get into the story, building these data centers and the utility business is not their high-margin business. But for Amazon, this business has margins, which makes it a high-margin business compared to their retail business. Anay Shah (01:26:30): It's almost like if I were an airline spending all this time trying to figure out how to book a reservation, and then you gave me a program that could do it for me. I can now focus on serving the customer and serving more customers faster, and it explodes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:45): Right. If you look at S3 in 2007, there were 10 billion items stored in S3. By 2009, that was about 64 billion. And by last year, 400 trillion items were stored in S3. Anay Shah (01:26:58): That's a really big number. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:27:00): It's a very big number. It's a lot of items. This powers the startup ecosystem and industry. Let's go back in time. So, what was driving the growth of all these numbers? Anay Shah (01:27:11): We're in Hackathon City. We're having happy hours with engineers and folks with ideas coming together. Now, if you have an idea, you can drop a credit card down, and you don't need to negotiate and buy hardware. No invoices, no contract, no sales calls. You're up and running within hours. AWS very brilliantly saw this as a pathway for short-term and long-term growth. In the short term, they can get a bunch of early-stage startups using their compute, and that's not going to amount to a lot of money. But some of them are going to grow, and they're going to be built on AWS. So they actually had a business model of giving out free credits at these happy hours, at these hackathons, to make AWS the default infrastructure platform to build a new company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:03): I think it feeds through from that go-to-market to their product design. Their product design was deeply unopinionated about what you were going to do. It was to make it easy for you to get a server to go do what you want to do with it. Here's storage, as simple as it can be. These are the simplest Lego blocks you can build on. And so simple, in fact, that people then built what feels like the same business on top of them. Ever heard of Dropbox? Dropbox is just an S3 application for this whole early period. Anay Shah (01:28:31): It's storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:32): It's storage. Let's make it easy for syncing files from your computer to this new cloud thing, backing them up, syncing them, and sharing them with other people. Dropbox and S3 are intimately linked, and Dropbox is built to do exactly that. It wasn't until 2015 that they were like, "Okay, we should probably look at the cost of this." They eventually moved off of AWS to their own servers because all they are is the storage layer. So that's a rare case where it made sense. Anay Shah (01:28:59): That's all they are. They're still getting $11.99 a month for me. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:29:01): That's right. Good lock-in. The Dropbox AWS story is a classic one, but there's probably no better partnership to exemplify this time than the one that Netflix had with AWS. Anay Shah (01:29:14): Their ability to scale with these companies is really something to behold. In 2008, Netflix was still primarily a DVD-by-mail company. For those of us that remember, it had launched a streaming service as a side feature. The leadership knew that there was something here. But in August of 2008, Netflix suffered a major database corruption in its primary data center. For three days, it disrupted their DVD shipping and their streaming ability. It stopped their business. This was a huge wake-up call. The recovery was very painful for Netflix. They realized that their on-prem, vertically scaled systems were too fragile, and they couldn't recover quickly enough from major failures. The leadership decided they needed architecture that was designed to be more fault-tolerant, elastic, and globally available, because they had aspirations of being able to stream their future business all over the world. They concluded that they needed to focus on their core business. Building this out in-house was slow and costly. So Netflix actually became AWS's first marquee, all-in, public reference of a customer that scales. This proved to be vital. By 2015, Netflix was delivering billions of hours of content annually, almost entirely over AWS and their own CDN. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:30:33): They were running thousands of EC2 instances and had all of their videos, the canonical system of record, in S3 — like the actual videos that we are watching now. They did at some point realize that it was so important for them to own the latency and cost of that last mile of delivery—that edge. This is a perfect example of a use case for CDNs. They launched in 2012 what they call OpenConnect and the Open Connect appliances. This means that they would go into those "meet-me rooms" that we had talked about before and drop a Netflix peering box that would directly connect to your local ISP, and they would do this for free. Right? The ISP just says, "Hey, we have a lot of people trying to access Netflix. Let's make it better, faster, and cheaper." Anay Shah (01:31:17): It's a win-win. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:18): It's a win-win. They cut out the CDN that they were using at the time. Netflix saves money. Customers are happier. Everyone gets their videos faster. This way, when someone on the ISP accesses the newest popular movie, it's already close to them. Amazon doesn't actually even — they barely get hit in that moment. It's obviously running what's called the control plane for Netflix. Anay Shah (01:31:38): Yeah, because if I have to wait three or four seconds for that preview to load, I might not watch that show. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:43): You might churn. This is what powers streaming to this day. The same model is what enables others to enable streaming at scale. All of this — this whole Netflix case study — is the perfect flywheel and customer to show that AWS can scale with you, scale in a really challenging environment, be resilient, and power global reach. Netflix was not just a U.S. company at this point. Anay Shah (01:32:05): Yeah. For anyone that saw AWS and the cloud as a concept — as risky, unable to scale, or not enterprise-ready — Netflix helped debunk that for chief information officers around the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:32:22): They would just do whatever it took. I can't remember the exact story — I think this is from the Acquired episode — where Amazon would allow you to ask them to roll in a big truck, slurp up all your data into hard drives, then they'd bring it to their data center to plug in and dump all your data into your AWS instance. So, they figured out what was needed to close the enterprise customers. It's just amazing that someone known for selling books was able to so quickly build the brand around how to do this new, private, secure utility thing at scale. Anay Shah (01:32:54): So AWS continued to rethink what data centers are used for and how to build them out to serve the customer. Rather than having one mega-facility per market, they introduced the concept of Availability Zones, which became clusters of independent data centers within a region — each on separate power lines, each on separate fiber paths, linked with millisecond private connections. This Availability Zone concept and clustering was yet another piece of the data center evolution that AWS contributed to the ecosystem. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:29): I feel like this notion of U.S. East and U.S. West — this is how people think about their servers now — is this abstracted notion of an Availability Zone. Anay Shah (01:33:39): AWS continued to do this globally, and this actually became a blueprint for hyperscale. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:44): To end the Amazon story here for now, I think it would not be wrong to credit them with really kicking off the utility-scale cloud story, right? And getting so many things right: giving developers the simple building blocks they could use; going after cost, reliability, and redundancy; making sure to build the right guardrails for virtualization so that they could actually do this efficiently and build for the long term, using the same APIs internally so that it created a flywheel for them to move faster and bring those cost benefits back to the core business. It propelled them so far ahead in this business; they are still the leader to this day in the core cloud infrastructure product. Anay Shah (01:34:28): As a result, as we've been talking about, the data center is simple at its core, right? It's a facility with storage, compute, and connectivity. What AWS does is take the data center and enable it to build an economy on top of it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:34:46): To frame it another way, it used to be that if you wanted lights in your house — if you wanted electricity in your house to power those lights — you would put a dynamo to burn coal underneath your house, right? And if you wanted a website on the internet, you would buy a server and plug it into your home ISP. That is insane to us today. "What do you mean? You're going to power my house with electricity from underneath my house, right?" Instead, I'm going to hook up this shared infrastructure with all of my neighbors, and we're going to centralize our demand and build the cheapest, biggest infrastructure we can to generate the power. That's the same thing happening here for the first time. This is the introduction of the concept of the cloud, right? People have had the internet where they're interacting with publicly visible websites. Private enterprises have servers, but the idea that you have your own storage over there in a Dropbox folder, or you as a developer could build whatever you wanted and access this floating blob of data — that's to you — invisible where specifically it is, but it's out there. That was, I think, the conceptual notion of the cloud. I've come to somewhat dislike the phrase because it feeds into the invisibility of the infrastructure, right? It says, "It is nowhere. Your photos are nowhere, your storage is nowhere." Anay Shah (01:36:07): That's so far from the truth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:09): It is somewhere. Anay Shah (01:36:10): It is in multiple locations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:12): In fact, the cloud is almost the design antithesis of the glass room. The glass room where you want to show off, "This is where it is. This is where the compute is happening." Anay Shah (01:36:22): It is only happening here; it is happening right now. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:25): But it served a good purpose in explaining this notion of migrating to this unknown location, and has remained pretty sticky, I think. So, while Amazon was out there selling books, a little startup out of Stanford was helping you organize and access the information on the growing World Wide Web. Anay Shah (01:36:44): Google was founded in 1998, and shortly after, it was handling about 10,000 search queries per day. By the end of 2006, it was processing the same number of searches every second. Google acquired YouTube in 2006, a year after its founding, and at the time, it was already one of the fastest-growing websites in the world with 100 million video views per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:07): I remember folks having their first webmail-based accounts, like a Hotmail account. They'd have 2 to 4 megabytes. Well, Google notoriously on April 1, 2004, announced and launched Gmail as an invite-only service that had a full gigabyte of storage. Anay Shah (01:37:22): I remember you could get access if you referred in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:25): If you referred in, or they started going on eBay for like $150, it was a hot ticket. By 2010, Gmail had over 150 million users. And of course, with more gigabytes of. Anay Shah (01:37:36): Storage available, it was amazing. It was from the very beginning the front door to the internet. But it was also going to need to be an infrastructure company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:46): So, you go back to 1999, a year into Google's life, and an engineer named Urs is being shown around as part of his recruitment by Larry Page, the CEO and founder. Urs says you couldn't really set foot in the first Google cage because it was so tiny. The cage was 7ft by 4ft with 30 PCs arranged on the shelves, providing the world with more Google than it could handle. Our direct neighbor was eBay. A bit further away was a giant cage housing Deck machines and AltaVista. All of this was hosted at Exodus in Santa Clara, one of those colo locations that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (01:38:21): So, Google was competing with AltaVista and all those others at the time. It was powering part of Stanford Search. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:28): That's right. Anay Shah (01:38:29): And running off of 30 PCs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:32): Running off of 30 PCs in this colo center, it cost Google about $1,400 per month per Mbps of data. So they had to purchase 2 Mbps. At the time, 1 Mbps was about a million queries per day. From the beginning, Google looked at its servers and infrastructure differently. It was never interested in taking the tried-and-true path of buying the Sun or even HP boxes. Anay Shah (01:38:56): One of the most memorable stories of this time that explains this is the infamous corkboard. So, in the early days, Google engineers literally mounted motherboards on corkboard. They had $15 box fans pushing air across. They had zip ties holding it together. In a traditional IT philosophy, this is heresy. But the idea was that if a part doesn't add reliability at fleet scale, strip it away. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:39:24): This all set in motion an ethos of questioning the assumptions and, ultimately, deep, deep vertical integration of their infrastructure. Some might argue that that was Google's superpower, and still remains so to this day. Apple's piling all of that thinking into making the perfect iPhone; Google's doing it to their data centers. Anay Shah (01:39:43): So Google had a number of innovations that came from this early time. One was around how to do power backup. So, the standard was to spend for a facility-wide big battery. Well, by 2000, Google was questioning this model and seeing the waste in the large battery. So they actually put little batteries on each server. Again, they were accepting that one might go down, but that was okay as long as the whole fleet was reliable. The key to all of this working was moving reliability up the stack into the software layer. Google was not using off-the-shelf file systems and off-the-shelf software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:40:22): They built everything here themselves. They assumed that hard drives would break, so they built the Google File System. This was around 2001-2002. So, this is a distributed file system that would take files, chunk them up, and spread them across three different servers no matter what. So you could always have resiliency. Also, this would make accessing a search index much faster. In 2003, they built Borg, a cluster manager, which ultimately was all about managing where jobs were running on which servers and machines. And it really was an extension of the virtualization and predates Kubernetes, which we'll talk about a little bit later. So, these were all the software components, but they were also questioning many of the physical constraints that people had looked at with servers. Most notably, they did some of the first experiments in "hot aisle, cold aisle" airflow containment. Traditionally, data centers were just a bunch of hot computers in a room, and they would blast cold air into the room. So you'd have to keep the room as cold as possible, often uncomfortably cold. There was no real thought about getting the hot air out of the room. Over time, it became accepted wisdom that you should point servers in one direction, get the hot air out of the room, and encourage that to happen. Google realized that the more you took that to an extreme, the better. So they would heat up and isolate the hot aisle from the cold aisle because then you could actually extract the hot air more efficiently and not mix it back into the cold. So, what we mean by cold aisle and hot aisle is that cold air needs to blow across those exposed chips and motherboards that would extract the heat off of the server into the hot aisle, and then the hot air from the hot aisle would need to be extracted out of the room. Google became a leader in designing the best airflow there. Anay Shah (01:42:05): This is a concept that continued for years. You also think about the traditional data center and this idea of assuming something's going to fail and building around that. Whereas in a colo facility, or when you're renting out these cages, every server had to work because it was a different company utilizing it. Not only that, 20 years ago you had specialty cleaning crews that were moving around the data center, and they would sweep up the room and then analyze the contaminants they had just swept up to understand how to continue to optimize the cleanliness and space around it. The idea of laying in a corkboard and a zip tie around it, and assuming something would fail, really takes the data center concept that existed then and completely flips it on its head and, as we'll see, drives better performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:42:59): All of this comes together when they build their own first scaled, homegrown data center. Anay Shah (01:43:05): I love this idea: Don't think of a data center the way we've been defining it, as a room packed with servers, power, and connectivity. Think of it as a warehouse-scale computer. Urs wanted us to think of it not as many machines, but as one machine. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:43:22): So, you think about the components of a computer, right? The storage, the memory, the compute. Urs saw what they were building out over time in their data centers and realized that they were just building a large computer that happened to be the shape of the warehouse. Anay Shah (01:43:38): Yeah. If you accept this premise, then you stop trying to make each server perfect, but you start thinking about making the fleet reliable, and you design entirely differently. So, this is about 2004. You have a wild man named Chris Sacca. So, before he was a famed investor, he was apparently a young, sloppily dressed individual walking around rural Oregon looking for "shovel-ready" enterprise zones where he could find some tax breaks. He was walking around asking for such astronomical quantities of power that, allegedly, a nearby town suspected him as a terrorist and called the Department of Homeland Security. But this was just what he was looking for. The Dalles, Oregon, had a site for him: 30 acres next to a decommissioned aluminum smelter that once drew enough power to power the needs of a small city. Sacca was ecstatic. He said it was visionary. This little town with no tax revenues had figured out that if you want to transform an economy from manufacturing to information, you've got to pull fiber. So Google went on to build out The Dalles, Oregon, and bring all of their innovation to bear to increase the performance of this data center. So, what that meant was low-cost, steady hydropower from the Columbia River; the Bonneville Corridor, providing high-voltage transmission; a cool, dry climate that lets you run a cooling process most of the year that's very economical; long-haul fiber that traces the river's edge; and a town that was hungry for a new tenant. This all came together to launch Google's first warehouse-scale computer to drive down unit economics, improve the performance of a data center, and therefore the unit economics of the entire fleet. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:45:35): And I would argue this is potentially the first built-from-the-ground-up, hyperscale data center. They're building to solve their problems, but their problems are at this point scaling so rapidly that they're thinking about how to optimize all these things, tuned with software, tuned with virtualization, and so this is the new blueprint for the future. That is still how we're generally designing data centers today. Anay Shah (01:46:01): They had a head start in thinking about infrastructure from the get-go, making it part of their DNA. It's not as if the other companies were standing still; they were building concurrently. This was a race, and they had to do it quietly. Google was the first to get operational in 2006. They quickly replicated this elsewhere in North Carolina and then in Finland, testing different climates to optimize. This included using seawater, hot aisle containment, and other ways to optimize cooling and performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:46:32): Yeah, there were other areas they kept pushing on, like the power supply system. Normally, each server you think about plugging into the wall converts AC to DC and then steps down DC for all the various components. Google instead realized that if they could just have a higher voltage DC current coming into the rack, they could then convert once cleanly and do it as late as possible. With that higher voltage, you'd have less loss, and you'd get efficiency gains across the whole path. So, at the scale Google was building servers, they could optimize every single part of the stack. Anay Shah (01:47:07): They later announced this 48-volt DC in 2016, publicly revealing double-digit efficiency gains that the world could then incorporate into data center design. Now, we've talked quite a bit about performance and efficiency, and there's good reason for that. Many data center companies were hemorrhaging money on power. The impact on the bottom line was significant enough that it needed focus. We had the distinct pleasure of talking to one of the OGs in data centers, Christian Belady. He told us this fantastic story of bringing the metric for power efficiency to the industry. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:47:55): It's called PUE, or Power Usage Effectiveness. This is a simple ratio of the total energy consumed by a data center, divided by the actual IT equipment you're trying to power. Right? So, it very easily spits out the overhead in running your data center. If it's two, that means twice as much energy is used for overhead than for the actual servers. And how did this metric come to be? Such a simple, beautiful metric. Anay Shah (01:48:21): Christian Belady was working at HP in the late 90s, and HP had a customer in Japan called NTT Docomo. Christian had been in the industry for so long that he had formulated enough standards through HP and the industry to come up with 10 best practices. He took these 10 best practices to Docomo, and they said, "Yes, this is great, we're going to implement all of this!" He replied, "Fantastic, come back in three months and we'll do a review." So he goes back to Japan, and they had printed out everything, with big stacks of paper on the desk. Everyone was in a suit and tie in a hot room when they told him, "Mr. Belady, we've done everything you said. Here are all of our reports, and nothing's changed. The servers are all still the same." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:07): "It's even hotter in the hot aisle, and no one wants to go back there. So it doesn't seem like it's any better." Anay Shah (01:49:12): "That's right. We're still hot when we go in there. We don't think this is working. We're going to go back to the way we were doing it." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:18): And it drives Christian nuts. The whole point was that you actually want the hot aisle to be hotter and the cool aisle to be cooler. That separation is what drives the efficiency. You don't want the air to mix. He knew in his bones, "No, you're running in a more efficient way. You have to see that." Anay Shah (01:49:35): NTT couldn't see the change or measure the efficiency gains of the hot aisle/cool aisle containment or the other recommendations that Christian was making. So he invented this incredibly elegant metric and kept it internal to HP. They continued to implement it in HP for six years until his good friend Chris Malone suggested he publish a paper and present it at Ken Brill's Uptime Institute in 2006. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:50:02): At the Uptime Institute, they presented the paper and kicked off a new organization called The Green Grid to publish PUE and other metrics. The team included Christian Belady, Paul Perez, Bruce Shaw, and Larry Vertel. These folks later became CTOs of Dell and led big teams at AMD. They thought it was just going to be an internal "here's the thing we tried" kind of paper. It hit the industry like a storm because the PUE race was now on, and Google wanted to win. Many enterprises had PUE numbers around 2, meaning twice as much power went to lights, cooling, and everything else compared to the amount of power that actually ran the IT hardware. Google pushed it down to 1.1, meaning only 10% of the power was not directly used to power the computers. Anay Shah (01:50:50): Their internal teams took hold of this and ran with it. They used this rethinking of the data center from the ground up as one computer system, with software being the reliability layer, not the hardware. This, along with innovative geographic placement, drove performance and PUE. It's come to a point where it essentially can't be optimized past one. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:16): Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's talk about what it is to go to one of these data center campuses. Anay Shah (01:51:23): You're driving up into vast open space where you suddenly see massive buildings growing out of the ground. From the sky, it maybe looks like a distribution center. You can see some steam flowing out from the building. But as you drive into this campus... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:42): You start noticing: "Why would there be so much power infrastructure if this is just a warehouse?" Because you're seeing big battery packs, extra turbines, or generators. Anay Shah (01:51:52): The other thing you'll notice is that security is everywhere. You'll have to pass through a series of checkpoints as you get to the front desk. Maybe they're powering Netflix, but they're also powering Pentagon operations. They have an enterprise obligation, so security is paramount. So, once you're approved, you manage to get through multiple layers of gates. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:14): And then there's a moment—the moment of big reveal—when you walk in, and it finally hits you: the rows and rows and rows of machines that just go on further than... Anay Shah (01:52:24): The eye can see. These facilities are bigger than a football field, and they're lined with racks of blinking lights and machines. You're hearing this constant whir, and you're noticing the temperature. When you walk in, it might be fairly comfortable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:42): I think 80 degrees is average in a Google data center today. What did it used to be like? Anay Shah (01:52:47): You had to keep these machines cool, and the best way to do that was to chill the room. So it was frigid; the entire room was blasting with AC. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:57): Back in the 80s, you'd just wear a thick sweater all the time. Now they can comfortably hover around 80. That's because of the really good containment they did of hot and cold aisles. Now you've taken in the machines, adjusted to the noise, and they've given you earplugs to get comfortable. You look up and start to see the infrastructure coming in, powering these servers and connecting them. Google famously had bright-colored wires and marked where the plumbing was. But it wasn't always like this. If you go back to the 80s, I think it was quite different. Anay Shah (01:53:27): You're now building right on the floor. But one of the ways to cool the data center decades ago was to raise the platform. So you'd actually look down and see that you're walking on panels above a hidden space where cold air was being pushed through. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:53:41): Per the trend of everything we've talked about, with Google driving the evolution, the question was: "What is the cheapest way to most efficiently do the thing we're doing?" And it stopped being those raised floors over time. Hopefully, that gives you a little taste of what it's like to walk into one of these. There is a nice Google podcast called 'Where the Internet Lives' that really gives a nice tour of exactly this. Anay Shah (01:54:00): It's a Google and Latitude Media production where you can actually hear the sounds as they record inside the data center. So the whir is very palpable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:54:12): Google's investments continue to grow. They continue to vertically integrate, deeper and deeper. They go to their own sites, start buying up their own fiber. They took advantage of some of that dark fiber that we mentioned earlier, snapping a lot of it up. All of this is a capacity strategy. Ultimately, they want to have the capacity redundancy to drive their own cost down. While, mind you, they're building the highest-margin, best business in the world in the form of search and ads. So that whole flywheel allowed them to continue to invest in this infrastructure. Google had explosive demand, as they were the web company here. They had explosive internal use driving the value of the vertical integration. But the whole industry saw what was going on with AWS after its launch. And Google was one of many companies that realized they had some assets to put toward that, too. So they put together a team that launched App Engine in 2008. It let you run apps on Google's infrastructure, but was very opinionated about the app. It only supported Python with a particular framework. So it was quite different than Amazon's basic building block EC2 approach. It wasn't until 2013 that Google launched a general-purpose virtual machine capability. As a result of this approach, as well as Google's lack of enterprise sales and marketing motion, it took quite a while for their cloud program to get running. Things started to shift in 2014-2015. Google went public about its containerization strategy. If you recall our discussion of virtualization: you don't actually need to package up the whole operating system. You don't really care that it's running Windows or Linux. You actually generally just want to run the application. Containers are really a way to do that at the application level. This continued even further more recently with the idea of serverless functions. Anay Shah (01:55:59): So Google in 2014-2015 took the world by storm by open-sourcing Kubernetes and the Google Kubernetes Engine. It very quickly became the default way for programmers to use containers and migrate away from virtual machines. Now, they still didn't have an enterprise sales and partnerships muscle. But Ben, you were there at this time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:56:18): That's right. That's when they brought in Diane Greene, who we previously talked about as the founder of VMware, to help build that muscle. By 2018, their cloud share was 7%, AWS was 34%, and Azure was 15%. So they were a distant third. Following through to 2019, a new leader came in who has been the leader since, and he has made big pushes, growing massively. Their cloud business is now a $13 billion business, growing 32% net-net. You look at Google's story, and it's interesting. They've always been technically ahead, especially internally. They've always had amazing dogfooders—meaning people inside using their infrastructure. The problem was they did not know how to sell to this customer. They were not really a developer platform, especially to the enterprise. This is a market Amazon had cracked, so they really had to learn new skills despite having the best tech in the entire ecosystem. The other story is that Google's vertical integration sometimes went too far. They figured out the best way to do this for themselves, but sometimes that led to blind spots in what someone not in the Google ecosystem might need. So, the idea that every developer was going to build a new Python framework that Google released was a little self-serving when it turned out engineers might just want maximum flexibility, which Amazon deeply understood. Anay Shah (01:57:33): And it all starts with giving the industry an entirely new way of thinking about it: Treat the data center as a single, evolving machine. Build the hardware to suit the software that will survive its own failures. Put the buildings in thermodynamically optimal and grid-optimal locations, and publish your math. Showcase your performance and your PUE so that everyone can have FOMO and try to play catch-up. So, Google was spending billions on land, buildings, and hardware, designing its own infrastructure and overturning the data center world by building software to bind it all. Which forced the entire industry to meet hyperscalers like Google on its own terms. Competition was heating up. It wasn't just Amazon and Google. There were even more household names quietly transforming themselves. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:58:28): By the mid-2000s, Microsoft was unquestionably the software king. Windows was powering 90% of desktops. Office was licensed to print money. But things were changing. Broadband penetration was climbing. We started to see the emergence of connected phones—BBM and BlackBerrys and things like that at the time. And internet-native companies. They saw Google and Amazon building, climbing, and proving that you didn't need to buy software on a CD to run interesting computing applications. Remember, the cloud, as we've been talking about, isn't just about backend developers. Applications themselves were starting to move—not just their backend, but the front end to the browser as well. Anay Shah (01:59:10): Right, on the browser. You remember, Salesforce was leading the charge here. They launched with this idea of "no software, all in the browser." By 2005, they were doing nearly $200... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:20): Million in revenue and capturing the mindshare, proving that this could be the future—not just of consumer applications, but also a business product like a CRM. Anay Shah (01:59:31): CRM enterprise B2B software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:34): So you're there, sitting at Microsoft. That is your greatest fear: that you're not going to be part of the application and operating system of the future. That is your whole business. At this point, it's not like Microsoft didn't run any web services. Ten years prior, Gates had sent his memo of the "Internet Tidal Wave." They had invested; they bought and scaled Hotmail; they had MSN; they had Xbox Live. But these were all self-contained services. They hadn't yet thought about how to expose an infrastructure to others to build on. They loved building operating systems that would ultimately run on others' infrastructure. They had built one of the best businesses in history doing this. They would write this code once, print as many CDs as they could, and it was this amazing, high-margin business. They didn't have to go buy other people's hardware. Anay Shah (02:00:16): They'd print the CDs, they'd print the money. This idea of infrastructure as a service was radical. Inside Redmond, Washington, the pivot for Microsoft was framed as nothing less than existential. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:00:28): As is often the case in a company motion like this, it's about people and talent. So they bought a company, Groove Networks, that brought in the famous Ray Ozzie, who had previously led the development of Lotus Notes. They brought him into Microsoft and made him co-CTO of the company. This was so existentially important. Think about what Meta's doing today to staff up talent. It was *that* important at the time. The cloud was the existential thing. "We need the leader of the cloud, Ray Ozzie, to come in and lead the way through this charge." Anay Shah (02:00:58): "If we're going to bet everything we've built on this pivot, we're going to bring in the best talent." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:03): So they bought the company, put them in charge, and this was a 5,000-word manifesto about what the future of Microsoft needed to be. It's worth reading the whole thing, and we'll link to it in the show notes. But Anay, would you read that key section that really stood out? Anay Shah (02:01:17): In Ray's memo, he says: "'Computing and communications technologies have dramatically and progressively improved to enable the viability of a services-based model. The ubiquity of broadband and wireless networking has changed the nature of how people interact, and they're increasingly drawn towards the simplicity of services and service-enabled software that just works.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:40): He ends that section by saying: "'Businesses are increasingly considering what services-based economics of scale might do to help them reduce infrastructure costs, or deploy solutions as needed and on a subscription basis.'" Anay Shah (02:01:54): "'—just give people the end result that they want and demystify everything that's happening.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:00): That's right. And he ends with: "We must respond quickly and decisively." For a company of Microsoft's scale and history, that was really trying to be a... Anay Shah (02:02:09): Wake-up call. And didn't Gates and Ballmer kind of give Ray Ozzie a blank slate, like, "You're the leader here. Help us understand where the future is"? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:17): Not just that, they let him carve out and run this separate from the Microsoft Server and Tools business, which had built Windows Server and SQL Server—which would have been the obvious place to try these things. But they knew that this was bigger than an evolution from what they were doing in their previous software business. This was a transformation: a fundamentally different product, a different business model, and a different go-to-market motion. So when everything had to change like that, it was very hard for the leader of the incumbent thing to keep going. Let's make this concrete. What does this mean for a server or a data center? Microsoft had Windows Server and SQL Server. When we talked about those server rooms that a company would run, they would very often be running Microsoft software. This was the IT sale they had perfected by this point. You would sell the Windows Server license, it would be Active Directory, it would be running Exchange and Outlook for your email, and it would be running your calendar and all these things inside your company's network. It'd be running Windows on their PCs. Anay Shah (02:03:15): So it's this beautifully connected thing. And this is saying, "No, no, no, we've got to move that server from your bottom line CapEx as a company into OpEx in our data centers." This is a transformational move from what you're providing at the end of the day—from just software that's going to run on someone else's computer—to actual services. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:03:32): Ray Ozzie goes for it. He staffs up a team they call Project Red Dog. They bring in Dave Cutler, who had previously led Windows NT and is a legendary programmer, to help lead the architecture of this new project. Anay Shah (02:03:46): So they're putting together this cloud strategy that is revamping Microsoft internally, and at the same time, ramping up direct competition to the front door of the Internet: Google. They evolved an old MSN Search product into what then became Live Search and eventually Bing, as we know it, in 2009. This was a moment that kind of rippled across the industry, especially for Google's dominance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:12): I was at Microsoft at this time. Anay Shah (02:04:13): Oh, yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:14): I joined Microsoft out of college in 2008 and was there in this moment: they had Windows Live Search. They briefly called it Live Search, then came this big rebrand to Bing. Microsoft was willing to spend a lot on this repositioning, on this marketing—so much so that they gave Yahoo a very sweet deal to power Yahoo's search and ads and gain some infrastructure market share. Anay Shah (02:04:35): This catapulted them into getting up to 20% share, which is no small feat in an exploding market that Google has been dominating. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:45): It's important to remember that doing search well and search ads well is a really hard scale problem that essentially only one other company had cracked, and that was Google. To respond quickly with an active, updated index of the internet, and to do this auction for the right ad unit—all of these things that you have to build—is what propelled Google to build their vertically integrated servers. And Microsoft was now putting themselves in the position of having to solve those same really hard technical problems, in addition. Anay Shah (02:05:12): To those really hard technical problems, we saw with Google that in order to effectively run this search business, you have to have a lot of compute power behind you. You now have to get into the data center business and build out infrastructure that is your own to drive down the cost and drive up performance. We mentioned Christian Bellady previously. He was at HP in 2007, gets a recruiting call from Microsoft, and his initial reaction is, "What the hell's a mechanical engineer going to do at Microsoft?" Because Microsoft is known as the software company, and so he turns them down a couple times. After the third call, he decides to go up for an interview, enjoys the process, gets an offer, but doesn't think much of it. And I believe he's at his parents' house when he suddenly gets an email from Bill G. (Bill@microsoft.com) explaining why he should accept the job offer. And Bill essentially says, "Everything's going to the cloud. We're investing for the cloud business, and we need to build out this new infrastructure as core to the future of Microsoft." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:06:24): This seems like a wacky idea to go there, but Bill G emailing me? Like, you're there with your parents, and you've got to give this a go. Let's pack our things, move to the Seattle area, and join Microsoft. And so at this point, he starts there, and Microsoft had just finished building their first real, more integrated data center build-out. This is in Quincy, Washington, in Eastern Washington, a 13-megawatt build. And he walks in there, and everyone's looking around, and the first thought they have is, "We're going to get fired because there's no way we're going to fill this thing with servers." There's just no way that we have the demand. Anay Shah (02:07:00): And this was their first massive-scale, purpose-built cloud data center campus. This was Microsoft entering the infrastructure business. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:11): And similar to what we saw with Google at The Dalles, a lot of the same things that attracted them to Quincy were power from the same Columbia River. They're getting cheap 1.9-cent per kilowatt-hour power at the time to power this. And the climate was that dry, cool climate that allowed them to be really economical with using outside air cooling for much of the year. They had multiple fiber routes. It's in Washington, so they could connect their Redmond headquarters directly to Quincy. Anay Shah (02:07:34): The environment, the fiber, the power—it all comes together. And they, like Google, knew they had to work with the local community and the local government. And so they actually worked with the City of Quincy to build a Quincy water reuse system to treat and recirculate the cooling water to reduce the dependence on the local community. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:53): They built Quincy. They have it up and running. He's worried they're not going to fill it, but they kept going. Azure ends up launching in 2008, which we'll talk about in a moment. But I think it's very easy for a big company that's bet a lot of resources building something internally to think that they have an idea of what demand is going to look like. But they overbuilt in Chicago. Then they had it mothballed, they tried to sell it, and then nine months later, they were so happy. They didn't sell it because they needed the space. Anay Shah (02:08:16): It was hilarious. They tried to sell it to the government. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:08:18): So, what's going on there, and what's happening, is they're launching this project, 'Red Dog,' which would become known as Microsoft Azure. And it's hard to predict the scale of the utilization of infrastructure as you launch it. So let's go back to October 2008—the big reveal. This is Microsoft's big annual Professional Developers Conference, and Microsoft unveils not Microsoft Azure at the time, but Windows Azure. Anay Shah (02:08:46): And this wasn't just Windows running somewhere else. It's a platform for developers to build and host applications on Microsoft infrastructure, paying only for what they used. Rent some storage and compute, pay for what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:00): And the key thing that you mentioned is, it was designed for those Windows developers. So it used all the familiar tools: the .NET Framework and Visual Studio and all these things. And it made it easy for you to take your work that you'd done over there that would run on Windows Server right inside of your office, and take that same code and shift it to run on Microsoft servers. What a powerful integration and move! It kind of split the thread between AWS, which gave these really basic building blocks—S3 and EC2—of this unopinionated 'run your own operating system, bring your own full thing, and we'll just make it work' approach. Anay Shah (02:09:35): Right. They were agnostic to what you were doing on top of it and how you were doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:37): Exactly. To Google App Engine, which was overly specific and cute about it, in a way Microsoft was almost more Google's approach, but it was the same code and the same thing that a developer had already used. And so they had this massive developer ecosystem and integrators, and this whole kind of motion around it. Anay Shah (02:09:54): It wasn't just easy for the developer community; this is Microsoft that has an enterprise sales engine. They've got a go-to-market motion. They have the finance department that knows how the sales team is going to operate and how to budget for it. And so they're bringing this world-class distribution and, most importantly, the trust from this massive customer base to bear with Azure. And the adoption is extremely rapid because people are already embedded in the ecosystem, and here you are coming with an improved product, and the enterprise base adopts it very seamlessly. Yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:10:28): And it's not the story that Amazon has to make for the first time, which is, "Hey, come build your thing with us in the cloud," and introduce this. This is four or five years later, and it's sitting there like, "How do we think about the cloud?" We don't have an agreement with Amazon; that's not an existing vendor relationship. Whereas with Microsoft, you're like, "This is the agreement we have, this is the IT relationship we have, this is the full trust." If you're telling us this is how we can move to the cloud in a seamless, secure, safe way that's going to integrate with Active Directory and Outlook, and I just don't have to run the machines in my closet anymore? Sign me up. Ironically, I think some of the people they had the hardest time signing up were the engineers and product managers in Redmond, Washington. We were actually talking with Ben Gilbert of Acquired about this, and he at the time (this was 2012, 2013) was working on the web version of Microsoft Word. So Microsoft is finally going to compete head-to-head with Google Docs on product and ship a version of Word that you can use via your browser. And of course, the desire was for everyone to use Azure. Did they? Absolutely not. They said, "No. This is the custom server we need. We need this. Many of them can scale this big, and we had to do some custom JavaScript rendering, all this stuff." We want our own servers, probably still in Quincy, but we're not using the Azure APIs and layers. Anay Shah (02:11:43): So the own employees are demanding all this heterogeneity, resulting in a wide variety of server SKUs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:11:52): Amazon, for context, building out AWS, I think had something like 20 different types of machines that were running AWS. Google, in their whole build-out, standardized on this vertically integrated, commodity-built server design. And so they would just keep it down to a handful of machine types. So supposedly at Microsoft, there were dozens and dozens of different SKUs that Microsoft was maintaining. So instead of calling this a server farm, someone called it a server zoo. You just think about where they're coming from in the evolution of all these different web services and different teams building their own thing. It's a whole different world. And around this time, I think energy starts to become an interesting layer as well. Anay Shah (02:12:31): So similar to Christian getting recruited in 2007, thinking, 'What the hell am I going to do at Microsoft?' he then goes out to recruit an energy expert. Brian Janes. In 2011, Microsoft saw the need for an energy person to be in-house. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:12:47): I'd say Microsoft saw the need, but I think Brian was confused. Anay Shah (02:12:51): Brian was like, 'I do energy, you don't need an energy person.' And his thought was, 'This is a dead-end job.' Being an energy person at a software company doesn't make sense because what they're trying to do is all about land, it's all about fiber. Energy's a distant third or lower down the list in the priority of how you think about scaling this type of infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:10): Yeah, I think at this time, for context, utilities were happy you'd show up with your 10 Quincy, 13-megawatt data center, and utilities are like, 'Sure, great, sign up!' Anay Shah (02:13:20): Yeah, generally power demand is relatively flat. There's excess power available, and they're happy to sign you up and increase their profits because it's not going to drive any new infrastructure needs on their end yet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:34): And how things change! This is 2011, 2012. Fast forward a little more than a decade to where we are now, and we'll get there. Anay Shah (02:13:43): But Brian took the job and ended up building a phenomenal team. And within a few years, his team was actually the decision-maker of where they were going to build out Microsoft infrastructure. And so it's a lead-in to us actually starting to care about where our energy is coming from and the whole complexity around where you're sourcing and doing these clean energy build-outs that Brian's team was leading. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:03): The team thought it was a real kind of planning challenge, right? And so they're bringing this up to leadership around, 'Hey, we need a lot of money to invest now to build this out.' Anay Shah (02:14:12): They're doing their annual budgets, they're projecting years in advance, they're getting into their mid-year review. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:19): Microsoft's in this weird transitional phase. They have Bing that they're still growing; they have other services. Xbox is booming, Azure is still early innings. So it's not the dominant use of their internal server build-out, but it's a lot of different teams to juggle and predict. And so this forecasting challenge is a real one. You bring this to leadership, and what are you there to say? Anay Shah (02:14:38): And you've talked to all the business groups to figure out what they're thinking, and you go to Ballmer with your prepared notes, and within a few sentences you get interrupted, and Steve Ballmer's like, 'Ah, the business groups don't know what they need. Let me tell you how to do this.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:52): And he says, "Give me the Excel sheet. You just draw a straight line from how growth has been going the last few years, and you just project it out, and you just build the data centers that that line shows you to do." Anay Shah (02:15:04): Just a straight line from here to 2020. The business groups, they don't know what the plan is. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:08): There's actually a lot of wisdom to what Ballmer's saying because you realize that every team is trying to be excited about what they're building and Azure is going to have all this demand, but no one really knows—especially more than 12, maybe 18 months out. So how can you plan if you're building long-term, multi-year build-outs for what anyone's going to need? Anay Shah (02:15:28): This moment of growth? It was quite difficult. And Janes' team found that he was consistently under-forecasting. But he did go back many, many years later, and he was kind of curious: how accurate were his forecasts compared to the straight line in 2020? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:43): He looked back, and Ballmer was off by how much? Anay Shah (02:15:46): 5%. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:47): 5%. So they should have just followed the line. So sure enough, Microsoft keeps at it, and the power team at Microsoft—the data center team at Microsoft—becomes one of the biggest builders in this industry. They shift from leasing square footages to megawatt-based deals, as they become a major, major hyperscaler. Anay Shah (02:16:08): There's a big learning journey for them, right, because they were a software company, and they had to grow very quickly into an infrastructure company. It was not an easy pivot to make, and they had to do that globally. The Microsoft team had the blessing of this entrenched enterprise customer base that was very loyal, very profitable, and very global. And so their go-to-market strategy was actually to follow their customers. And that meant that within a few years of launching Azure, they were getting calls from customers in Frankfurt, in Amsterdam, in Singapore. If their German multinational had data sovereignty questions, Microsoft would go and stand up capacity in the region. And so by 2015, they had announced over 20 regions, which was actually more than Amazon at this time. Each anchored on an interconnection-rich metro and typically supported by entering with colocation facilities—perhaps the Digital Realties of the world—before moving on to dedicated Microsoft campuses once they built up enough critical demand. But this go-to-market strategy forced them to innovate and expand all over the globe, and it drove massive results quite quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:17:33): And to that point, you fast forward to today, and Microsoft's business is in significant part the Azure business. Azure is a core growth driver. It's now 75 billion of revenue a year and growing 40% year-over-year. And so this company that was 'the software company' ('we write software, we sell software, those are our core platforms, those are our products, that's what we do') is no longer just a software company; they are, in large part, a data center company. So we've gone through AWS, Google and GCP, Microsoft and Azure. But there was another company that many thought for many, many years was just a toy. Let's talk about Facebook. Anay Shah (02:18:16): The Facebook, the Facebook. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:19): In February 2004, Facebook's running out of a single server in Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard University. Early days caused crashes. In fact, many of his earlier products, including FaceMash, the 'hot or not' for Harvard campus, melted down the servers in the Kirkland House, and the IT department at Harvard was not pleased. But then it becomes a real company, right? Anay Shah (02:18:40): And they start expanding to other campuses, and you've got different schools putting on different servers in different data centers. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:49): In a way that I think creates automatic resiliency because if the server crashed for, whatever, Penn, it's not going to bring down Harvard. Anay Shah (02:18:56): And this isn't their concern, right? They're building this viral, game-changing platform that is exploding, probably beyond their expectations. And new campuses are signing up. So they're not really concerned about the infrastructure, but it's just growing organically. By the time they launch News Feed, you've got hundreds of millions of people refreshing this site, uploading photos by the billions, opening up Messenger just as a reflex of the thumb. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:19:23): And the company's spending all this money; they raised VC dollars and they're not happy spending all this money on fancy servers and colo cages. Anay Shah (02:19:29): And so they're realizing, 'Why is everyone making so much money on us?' There's got to be a better way to do this. And there are two broad ways that they go about this. One is similar to what we've seen with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which is the thought that, 'Hey, we can do this better, cheaper if we build our own custom data center.' And so their first purpose-built facility was announced on January 10th and began operations in 2011 in Prineville, Oregon. And they soon followed with North Carolina, Sweden, and Iowa, and expanded rapidly. But Prineville was, just like all the others, quite intentional and quite strategic. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:20:09): Yeah. And so similarly, in this kind of Northwest region, you had cheap power, you had a dry, cool climate, and you had Oregon's incentives starting to come into play where they offered long property tax abatements on any improvements they made. All of this combined to make a great site for their first 'Lighthouse' data center. And if you look at the numbers of server growth, if you go back just to 2008, they had 10,000 servers; in 2009, 30,000 servers. Supposedly by 2010, when they are really kicking off and building the Prineville project, they have around 60,000 servers. They're trying to figure out how to scale up. Anay Shah (02:20:42): And so they decide to engineer the building and the servers together. This very purpose-built facility. And just like the others, they realized that they can beat industry standards. And so they very famously and publicly came out with this first purpose-built facility with a very aggressive target of a 1.15 PUE. Industry average is 1.5. Historically, they were north of 2, and they were able to report 38% less energy, 25% lower cost against prior facilities. And do you think they ended up beating their PUE? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:15): No way. Anay Shah (02:21:16): Smoked it: 1.07. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:20): So that means that only 7% of the energy going to run the data center went to anything other than powering the IT equipment. That is phenomenal. Anay Shah (02:21:30): Amazing. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:30): Did they keep this to themselves, how they did this? I think this is what sets Facebook's approach apart. Anay Shah (02:21:38): This first part they needed to do, and they executed extremely well. But the second thing they did was far more revolutionary. In a very secretive world of data center development where each hyperscaler kept their builds to themselves, in April of 2011, Facebook open sourced their blueprints. They announced the Open Compute Project. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:01): It's hard to overstate how radically different an approach this was. This is an industry that kept the design of the servers in the data centers extremely secretive. They viewed that as core IP, differentiation, and notions of security. Google would publish papers, especially on things like PUE, and be visible about metrics that they wanted to highlight. But they famously didn't let anyone into their data centers until this really changed the game. Anay Shah (02:22:29): Their motivation is pretty interesting. They look around at all the other big data center companies and they're seeing all the margins that are being made. They're like, 'Well, wait a minute, if we publish our blueprints and we get everyone else to buy in and publish theirs, that means we can drive down the costs by standardizing what we're building.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:50): Ultimately, what they want is for their suppliers to be in increased competition. The best way to do that is not to make one deal with one supplier, but to say, 'Hey, suppliers, this is what we need, this is what we like. You make this, we'll buy it as long as it's the cheapest one out there.' Anay Shah (02:23:04): Yeah, it flips the power dynamic. Now, instead of the vendors and suppliers dictating what the specs are and having multiple different specs for multiple different customers, they're able to standardize it and say, 'You're going to respond to the Open Compute Project standards.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:23:17): And it was directionally aligned with all the innovation that we saw at Google. There's actually a big parallel echo here, right? Google built all of these in-house software orchestration tools that we talked about that made the data center reliable. Facebook grew up in that open-source world and benefited from that, and was able to build on top of that. So it's not surprising that they're the ones to look at the hardware design and say, 'Why is this any different? We don't want to be the sole developers of this part of our infrastructure.' It actually benefits us to have other developers and the ecosystem in part because — and this really gets to a business model motivation — we're not trying to sell that innovation. We're not trying to sell anything to another business other than ads on our feed. The better and the cheaper this infrastructure is, the better our business margins are going to be. Anay Shah (02:24:05): Yeah, we want to take this cost item and reduce it, so we can put more of our budget, more of our focus, onto the core business. They're looking at it and they're like, 'Well, the industry is using a 19-inch rack because that's what the telcos did.' 'Well, that's not suiting what we needed. There's no reason for the 19-inch rack. It was just a legacy element.' So Facebook decides to do it differently. They widen it to 21 inches and publish that to make it more efficient and fit their needs better. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:24:33): It's this funny thing how companies are open strategically, so it's important to be clear-eyed about what they're open about and what they're not. Would Facebook publish publicly the exact way that their News Feed ranking works? No. But that's very different than this infrastructure layer that benefits them when the ecosystem adopts it. I think one thing that's amazing about it is how much the industry rallied around it and started to join it. OCP ripples across the industry. Microsoft starts bringing their designs into it. Google contributes big improvements, like we talked about, their 48-volt design. Telcos and everyone joins this, and it has the intended desired flywheel effect. Anay Shah (02:25:12): It did normalize the idea of transparency, and this was right around the time where companies like Google at first were publishing their PUE. So, this notion that we can be transparent with our results as a way to drive the industry forward, bring down costs, and make this whole part of the business easier for everyone, spurred more competition. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:25:33): This kicked off the sustainability race among these four hyperscalers. I would say this started all the way back in 2007 when Google announced that they would achieve operational carbon neutrality. Anay Shah (02:25:43): Each of the companies followed, and they were serious. Right? Microsoft committed to carbon-neutral operations in 2012. It drove site selection, their power purchase agreements, and how they negotiated and determined who they were going to work with and their relationship with their utilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:26:01): And it just accelerates. Amazon kicks off the Climate Pledge to get net-zero by 2040. You have zero-waste goals. Microsoft announced water-positive by 2030 in 2020. Google catches up with a similar announcement a year later. So you just have this era of accelerating commitments and goals. I think it's good to ask, why is this? Does it just feel good? Having worked at some of these companies, I do genuinely think the leadership wants the company to have a positive environmental impact, and it is the economically right thing to do as well. These goals of efficiency lead to your data centers, which are a growing item of operational scale, costing you less and less. The other thing this does is catalyze different renewable buying and procurement habits, right? These teams, like the one led by Brian Janis at Microsoft, become energy-buying procurement machines. They're looking to help accelerate that next solar project, that next wind project, to then be able to buy — via what's called a virtual power purchase agreement — the accounting for the clean electrons. Google pushes this even one step further to say, 'Hey, we want to buy electrons that are generated at the same time that our data center is using electrons.' So we want this notion of 24/7 carbon-free electricity. This really pushes the clean energy ecosystem forward, I think, in a material way. If we look at these three commercial cloud businesses of AWS, GCP, and Azure, they are behemoths, as we said. Azure hit $75 billion last year, GCP surpassed $50 billion, and AWS was on a run rate of $111 billion for that business. You total that up, that's $236 billion a year spent only on the direct cloud infrastructure businesses. Anay Shah (02:27:51): Let's put this in perspective. That's $236 billion across these three companies spent on the infrastructure. US consumers spend $500 billion annually on electricity. So we're talking about half the spend of all residential electricity across this country. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:28:10): So I think it is safe to say that we have now entered the utility era of computing. It just so happens that the utilities are Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Meanwhile, Meta, first of all, doesn't want to buy power from those three utilities. They also use so much themselves that they want to build their own and have no interest in selling access to it. They just need their own data centers to run everything that they're doing in-house at such an immense scale. So we end the 2010s with a very mature cloud, right? I think it's almost in the background. People don't even need to talk about and explain the cloud anymore. It's like, 'Of course, this is how you're going to start and run your company.' The functionality is all grown up. All of the companies are now running containerized Kubernetes things. Your services are portable. Yes, they have their functional differences and their sales differences, but they're all kind of mature and stable, multi-region. All of this stuff going on. Anay Shah (02:29:04): Nobody asks, 'Do you have a cloud strategy anymore?' It just is the way business is done. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:29:08): You also have the new startups that have built out the missing pieces. You have the Snowflakes of the world that are helping build more specialized databases. You have Datadog helping you with orchestration — real significant public-scale businesses that have built the missing components of the cloud moment. Anay Shah (02:29:23): And the feeling right now is one of maturity of the cloud infrastructure, maturity of a new large-scale data center build-out, and at the same time, a huge pressure to continue to build. There is a global race; it is fierce, it is competitive, and it has many, many more players than just these hyperscalers. To give you a sense, Microsoft scaled from 35 regions to 75 regions over the period of a couple of years. So they were adding an entire region a month. This is data center region build-outs. Deal size was ballooning at the same time. A decade ago, a large lease might have been 5 megawatts. You fast forward to the end of the 2010s, and every one of the hyperscalers is reserving 100-megawatt campuses. So, a 20x growth in the size of the data center over this decade. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:21): These two big points fit. The whole idea that the cloud now can be taken for granted and invisible is because of these scaled, global build-outs. You don't get to do that if the thing isn't just working as usage is exploding across the entire industry. Anay Shah (02:30:35): The industry has matured around private equity money coming in. You've got developers treating this as a real estate asset class, and they're stockpiling land, pre-building substations ahead of demand because they know what the hyperscaler or the next large company is going to need, and they're going to snap up that capacity. So this build-out is fierce on land. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:56): Not only is it fierce on land, it's fierce in the seas. It's not enough just to have your own servers and your own buildings and your own power infrastructure. You need confidence that you can stay connected. The best way to have confidence is to put your own cables underwater. So instead of just renting capacity, which of course they continue to do, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and others start financing and building their own undersea network. This way, they can control end-to-end. You think about Google's vertical integration: it starts with the box, it goes to the rack, then it goes to the building, then it goes to the campus, then it goes to the wires that connect the campus. That's how you get confidence in what you're building. This leads to improved economics and improved performance. Anay Shah (02:31:38): And performance continues to drive forward. But by the end of the 2010s, PUE had plateaued around an incredible 1.1. Only 10% of the power being used in this facility is not directly for the server and IT equipment. So, as we talked about in the sustainability race, the bragging rights had shifted. The marketing teams had moved off of PUE, and now they're talking about carbon intensity (CUE). Now we're talking about water intensity (WUE), and the holy grail metric here is who is launching 24/7 real-time renewable-powered data centers. Everyone's putting out their climate pledges, building into their plans, and driving the entire renewable energy and PPA world forward through this genuine focus on carbon intensity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:32:28): Intensity. The cloud by 2020 was doing what it needed to do. So we now had this scaled, mature global technology for storing things, computing things, connecting all of us, streaming content, and powering video calls. Why might that be helpful as we go into 2020? Anay Shah (02:32:48): Well, Ben, we're now upon everyone's favorite moment in recent history: the dark days of the COVID pandemic — a time where we all had to stay at home and a time where society, systems, public health, everything was stretched to the max. The same actually goes for our data center infrastructure. While the 2010s saw fast, consistent growth of cloud computing, COVID compressed five years of adoption into about 18 months with everyone at home. Video calls, gaming, online collaboration, telehealth, e-commerce, SaaS — everything surged all at once. We all remember the endless video calls, but let's put that into perspective a little bit. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:33:35): Going into this era, Zoom had something like 10 million folks as daily meeting participants. Fast forward to March 2020: they hit 200 million in four months. One month later, 300 million. So, just explosive growth. Google Meet similarly saw 3 million new users per day in April. Peak usage was up 30x since January, and gaming was exploding. They're at home, looking for entertainment, so Steam is shattering records. Anay Shah (02:34:03): Netflix and YouTube famously had to throttle down the network speed to lower resolutions to avoid essentially breaking the Internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:34:11): I was at Stripe at the time, and to the e-commerce point, it was just this explosive moment where, sure, you saw some businesses, perhaps in travel in particular, struggle and go under. But the majority of Stripe's users were exploding. Everyone was ordering stuff online. Instacart and DoorDash were booming. It's easy to say five years of growth in 18 months. What does it actually feel like when you're working on the infrastructure? It feels like everything is breaking, and you're trying to make sure no one in the outside world feels it. We managed to accomplish that, and I'm very proud of that. The API stayed up, and payments were processed even as they scaled rapidly. Anay Shah (02:34:45): Another company in the crosshairs that seized the day was obviously Zoom. They had to scale infrastructure from 10 million to 300 million users in months. They added servers in colocation metros, they used AWS, they used Azure, and they expanded aggressively on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. They were just doing everything they could to ensure that those video calls didn't have delays. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:35:09): Under the hood, the way Zoom works, you can think of it split into two: the Zoom Control Plane, which was making sure that it would respond to your logins and understand what you are as a participant in a meeting. But then you actually had the video feed, and that would have these meeting zones where Zoom would make sure to connect you to the closest meeting zone in a carrier-dense building. So it's kind of very similar to the CDN networks that we talked about earlier with Netflix, but it had this dual, bi-directional nature to it. They were in a race to add more of these peering machines in those telco hotels that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (02:35:41): And Zoom became proof that the cloud's elastic promise was real. In the greatest stress test of its time, capacity could materialize as fast as humanity demanded it. This was the moment. We were in an era of exploding demand, and there are a few key themes that affect the data center world in this moment. One of them is famously known as ZIRP. On March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target rate to the range of 0 to 25 basis points. What does that mean in the infrastructure world? That basically lowers the hurdle rate for your risk for speculative builds. So now campuses and shells can be built out way ahead of leases being signed because the carrying cost of that infrastructure was so low, because your cost of capital is so low. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:33): You're buying a house. This was the time when your interest rate on the mortgage was as low as possible, so you could buy more house. Well, if you are a company trying to build data centers, it's the same story. You can buy more data centers. Your same amount of principal is going to go much further in building out more. Anay Shah (02:36:50): As a company in this infrastructure environment, you can take more risk. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:54): The hyperscalers took advantage of this and started pouring money into building new data centers. But so did Blackstone. In 2021, Blackstone purchased QTS Realty Trust, one of the largest data center builders in the industry, for $10 billion. Anay Shah (02:37:07): There's so much capital floating around, and the beauty of the data center asset class was that it had started to look very predictable. It was looking like utility-style returns. Everyone's investing in the REITs and the infrastructure debt. This is fantastic for the counties that were building this out, namely Loudoun County, which we've talked about before. Right? Their budgets were suffering in the COVID era, but because they're Data Center Alley, they saw their server equipment tax go past $400 million annually, and that prevented them from needing to raise property taxes to fill their budget gaps. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:37:46): I think at some point their vacancy was below 1% in all of this. So there's just so much demand for space, colocation, interconnection. Everything is just flying off the shelves. Anay Shah (02:37:56): Another major theme here is what is defining the build-out. What you find now is that it starts to grow the panic around the urgency for electrical supply. It was both the amount of supply of power that you want, as well as the time to power, because there is this capital looking to go to work. The question was actually, 'How soon can you get me the power?' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:38:23): This is new, right? The scale of the data centers earlier — these 5, 10, 15-megawatt data centers — didn't necessitate a big conversation with the utility. We're now talking into the 50 to 100-megawatt builds, and this changes the dynamic with suppliers. We had folks in Ireland saying for the first time, 'We're going to pass regulation that says the utility can block a data center from coming in because it's too much load.' Anay Shah (02:38:47): You can't just walk up to a utility and plug in for 100 megawatts. For the first time, grid capacity and planning was a throttling factor in how fast data infrastructure could grow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:01): The era from 2010 to 2018-2019, which was this big shift to the cloud that we talked about, was one of increased efficiency in these systems that ended up balancing out the increase in demand and capacity. So there's actually relatively flat power-use growth despite there being so much growth. While there was more demand, it was a steady increase, and the efficiency jumps could go in concert with the growth jumps. Anay Shah (02:39:30): So you buy a new phone, you buy a new computer — most of it's all the same, except you just get more processing power because of Moore's Law. That brought about these efficiency gains. We were building a lot of new data centers and compute, but total energy consumption of data centers actually remained relatively flat throughout this period. It was largely due to a few factors. One is that we moved into the... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:54): ...cloud, and everything we talked about earlier with utilization can then come into play, right? Anay Shah (02:39:59): Exactly. One study found that the cloud is 93% more efficient than running your compute power on-premises because you have less wasted assets combined with everything we talked about with PUE and driving down that efficiency. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:14): Well, now all of a sudden you had COVID plus ZIRP, where you're not waiting to get more efficient; you're just trying to build more and more. Anay Shah (02:40:22): We'd also kind of run out of that low-hanging fruit, right? PUE is at 1.1. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:28): So if you look at the big four that we talked about before — Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta — between 2017 and 2021, in those four years, they doubled their energy use to 72 terawatt-hours in 2021. Anay Shah (02:40:40): So much greater demand, combined with a loss of the PUE benefits and the cloud efficiency, means we're in a new paradigm of power usage, and the industry is having to reckon with that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:52): It's pretty amazing that we had such a flat period for how much growth that we just talked through. I mean, the whole scale-up of the cloud led to growing usage, while the efficiency gains were so significant. We've run out of those tricks. Right? Anay Shah (02:41:05): Right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:06): The hot and cold aisles are contained. We've virtualized everything; we've containerized everything. We need to come up with some new tricks. I hold out some optimism that necessity is the mother of invention, and we'll figure out some new tricks because we'll have to. Anay Shah (02:41:18): We have to. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:20): That being said, there is an extreme way that a new power user is showing up in this era. Let's talk about the crypto miners for a bit. Anay Shah (02:41:29): Let's talk a little bit about crypto because it's not just a hobby, but actually ends up being a competitive buyer in the data center infrastructure build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:40): By 2022, 100 to 150 terawatt hours. So that's almost 50% of what the rest of the data centers are consuming now going to crypto mining. Go back to 2009, Bitcoin launches, and it's pretty much just a dark corners of the internet thing, right? Someone mining on a PC in their bedroom. Then, finally, folks figure if you buy GPUs off the shelf, you can go faster, and people start even designing custom ASICs that are designed to do nothing but mine Bitcoin and other coins. By the mid-2010s, mines had become significant power loads, and folks had started to build these out wherever they could find cheap electricity. Anay Shah (02:42:14): And while the technology behind crypto was interesting from a business perspective, it was less of an IT business and more of a power arbitrage business, because it was all based on how efficiently you could mine and where you're doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:29): Hard math computation as many times as you can. This is purely solving problems using power. And this is very, very different than everything we've said about data centers before. This is just compute as cheaply as possible. Anay Shah (02:42:43): And this really comes to a collision point in the real world where you had markets like Iceland and Eastern Washington where Bitcoin miners were outbidding these cloud providers for the cheap hydro and the power that was available. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:57): Then the crypto industry starts to realize that there's power that's not useful to others. Let's look for ways and places to put crypto mining that you couldn't even put a data center or a normal industrial load. You're in an oil field and you're flaring excess gas. What if you put a turbine there, burn that, and power a crypto mine? This is how Crusoe, which later became one of the premier AI data center build-outs, got started finding that cheap power source. And so, it's interesting how many of these power-related innovations came from the crypto moment. Anay Shah (02:43:27): Then, crypto loads were different. They were large, but they were fairly mobile. So that was an advantage in terms of where and how quickly they could place. But it also meant that policy could step in and shape the industry fairly quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:43:39): By 2021, most crypto mining was happening in China. There was the cheapest power. It was close to where the hardware was being manufactured. But in 2021, China cracked down. There was no more crypto mining. So all the miners fled to Texas, to Kazakhstan, to Canada. And so, by early 2022, the US share of crypto miners was back up to almost 40%. This is up from 3 to 4% in 2020. Anay Shah (02:44:03): What started out as a hobby and took over the fintech world and financial infrastructure forced real estate, power, and the compute industry to wrestle with how to connect very large, very flexible loads to stressed grids. And what innovations can be born out of trying to wrestle with that. On that point, crypto as an industry didn't care much about its footprint. But the rest of the industry, and the data center industry in particular, continued to be very focused on the carbon intensity of their operations. Now, these hyperscalers were tracking their carbon footprints with extreme precision. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:44:40): By 2020, Amazon became the world's largest buyer of renewable energy. It's a scale thing. Amazon signed the climate pledge. And for Amazon to hit net zero, they didn't just have to decarbonize their data centers and offices; they had fulfillment centers and travel of unprecedented scale, delivering all the packages. Anay Shah (02:44:59): And this is beyond just the quote-unquote "right thing to do." As we've talked about, oftentimes the cheapest, most economical way to get new load onto the grid and scale is through renewable power. And in a zero-interest-rate environment, it actually makes these PPAs more and more attractive, and it lowers the hurdle rate. So, a wind project that might otherwise have been too expensive in this environment is profitable and able to be signed on to a Microsoft new build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:45:30): It's hard to appreciate the flywheel of more demand for the data center services driving data center build-out, which can be funded by a zero-interest-rate environment, which then all drives all the renewable energy build-out, which is similarly funded by the zero-interest-rate environment. You just had an infrastructure build flywheel running that set us all up for what might come next. Anay Shah (02:45:53): It was an extremely timely moment in the evolution of data centers and actually served as a dress rehearsal for the unprecedented scale that we are going to see in the AI boom. This moment during COVID, with cheap capital flooding the system, was driving a massive new build-out. Power was starting to become a much more limiting reagent in the development of our infrastructure, and there was a breaking down of our global supply chains which was feeding this build-out. All this happened at this moment, right before a massive boom. So, now we've spoken about the companies building the big infrastructure, the big servers powering our life, and we have a $4 trillion elephant in the room that I think it's time to introduce. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:46:40): It's now time to talk about Nvidia. Nvidia started as a company that was trying to figure out how to make gaming run faster on computers. So, they made gaming chips. They did this for years and years and years. And I remember them recruiting many a student out of the Stanford EE department to go work on gaming chips. Anay Shah (02:46:59): They were very much tied to the gaming industry. Their growth was correlated to it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:05): But it turns out the same thing that you're doing in a game — which is doing a bunch of math to figure out how to render a pixel on a screen — is what you sometimes need to do complex science: a bunch of tough math problems at once. And if you're going to build a cryptocurrency, what are you doing? As we said earlier: a bunch of tough math problems at once. Anay Shah (02:47:21): A lot of compute, matrix multiplication at... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:24): Scale, to such an extent that their stock price starts to get tied to what's going on in crypto mining. Anay Shah (02:47:29): First, they had been tied to the game industry; now they became even more correlated to crypto. And then, in 2018, you have the crypto winter. That fall in the crypto industry dragged Nvidia's stock down 17% in one day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:45): Over that period, they got cut in half. Anay Shah (02:47:47): And so, enter COVID, and you hit a crypto boom-bust cycle. But machine learning algorithms are spitting out more and more recommendations to us as we're sitting on YouTube and Netflix and Instagram. And you know what powers a recommendation model? An Nvidia GPU. And so, growth of these training models takes off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:08): And you can see it as a line item, right? In their earnings, they have this carve-out for what they call their data center business, which is really the growth of this business. You see 60% growth. Anay Shah (02:48:18): This hit nearly $4 billion in just a quarter. And this consisted mostly of their A100 chips. They were selling thousands of these. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:26): Right. And so, these A100 chips became the backbone of the early era of training models. So, in 2020, Microsoft announced the next stage of their partnership with OpenAI. They committed to buying 10,000 or more of these A100 chips to build a special data center, a special supercomputer for OpenAI to continue developing their models. And remember, at this time, OpenAI was not really a household name; it was... Anay Shah (02:48:47): ...a research project, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:48): Yeah, I mean, that's right. It was a leading, well-funded AI lab with this deep collaboration with Microsoft, building models that were available via API. And in the same year, they published a paper that really demonstrated something that they had discovered and what they call their scaling laws, showing that the bigger the compute and the larger the data set you threw at the problem, the better the model. And Google was discovering very much the same thing: the more chips, the better the model. Anay Shah (02:49:15): How convenient. The more chips, the better the model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:18): Music to Jensen's ears, I think. Anay Shah (02:49:21): Indeed. And so, in 2022, right as the crypto crash was coming, OpenAI released a new model, GPT-3.5. It was a huge upgrade from GPT-3, and they had built it in their new Microsoft data center. And they were thinking about new ways to show to the world the value of what they've been able to build. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:41): Are you saying not everyone wants to use an API sandbox to understand how good a model is? Anay Shah (02:49:45): Right now it's a little bit hard to access, but maybe if you put a simple box as a UI and create a little chat feature on the GPT, it'd be a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:59): Nice demo at least, right? Anay Shah (02:50:00): Right. Few people might be interested, so they decided to put out this chat function. On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT launched. In five days, they had a million users. This was far and away beyond the team's expectations, as well as their capacity planning. According to Sam Altman, they expected an order of magnitude less interest by January 2023. ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. So, after getting a million users in five days, they crossed 100 million users in just two months. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:50:41): By this last summer, ChatGPT's website was among the top five most visited sites in the world, right after Instagram. So there was real consumer and enterprise pull. The world had been waiting for AI to be a thing for a very long time, but this was the moment where everyone said, "Okay, this is it. This is the time." Anay Shah (02:50:59): It ended up with over a billion prompts a day. People were loving this thing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:02): And everyone knew, to make it better, we just needed more chips. Why is Jensen so delighted? Where are we now? Anay Shah (02:51:09): Three years later, more chips, better models, right? Three years ago, in 2022, Nvidia's data center revenue was growing rapidly: $4 billion in revenue that quarter. Last quarter, their data center revenue was a staggering $39 billion. That's it growing nearly 10x from what it was in three years. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:30): To add $36 billion in quarterly revenue in three years, it's unprecedented. Anay Shah (02:51:37): This is powered by this discovery of the scaling laws. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:41): And the timing of their product launch could not have been better. They had the A100. That was essentially for training — scaling your training. But they launched the H100 in 2022. That was designed for this moment. It was the rocket boost of a chip. It added new special math modes tailored for transformers. It added more high-speed memory. As a result, it slashed training time and made inference faster. Anay Shah (02:52:07): And these H100s are flying off the shelf, from selling a million and a half in 2023 to over 2 million in 2024. And the big players, having learned from past years of the cloud boom and the COVID demand boom, are ordering these in the hundreds of thousands. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:23): These things are not cheap. Each chip is like a car, right? $40,000 apiece, supposedly. You couldn't buy one chip at a time. Anay Shah (02:52:32): No. Why would you sell one car at a time when you can put them in boxes? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:35): They really sold in two models, right? There are training boxes and inference boxes. The training box is an 8-GPU box with a CPU in the middle. They're hardwired with this NVLink connection. What's really interesting about this is it's all about making it effectively one big GPU. It's all about creating this really high-bandwidth connection between these GPUs. Because when you're training, that's what you want. In NVLink, if anyone's ever built a computer, you would have what's called a PCI connection in a motherboard. The way your Nvidia graphics card would plug into your computer was using PCI. It felt like a really fast connection. But it's not fast enough for this. So Nvidia invented NVLink. It's up to 15 times faster than that connection. So these eight GPUs can communicate extremely quickly. One training box is about $500K to buy. Then they also launched these inference boxes. And so, this is two GPUs coupled with a bunch of memory. To be clear, inference is when you're asking ChatGPT a question and it's responding. That process of responding is inference. You want a lot of memory to be able to understand all the content in that response. These boxes were designed with a lot of fast memory, connected to be able to share context across the model. Anay Shah (02:53:46): Now, selling these GPUs in a box actually has a physical space implication, right? So you've heard us talk about the racks and racks in the data center as far as the eye can see. These racks have slots for servers, and those servers have a traditional power consumption. But when you put in a specialized server, it starts to change the power consumption of that rack and therefore of the square footage and of the data center. So let's unpack, just for a moment, what's happening at the rack level when AI arrives. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:54:16): Historically, one rack would be maybe 400 watts. So you'd build a rack with 20 to 30 of these servers. You'd have some networking equipment. So, somewhere around 5 to 10 kilowatts of power going to a rack — that's like 10 hair dryers running at the same time, to give you a sense. Now, these GPU boxes arrived — those eight-GPU training boxes. Each of those is up to 10 kilowatts by itself. So it's the same power consumption and heat as the whole rack was. But you could now pack a rack physically with four to eight of those boxes. So, all of a sudden, you're an order of magnitude up in power consumption, up to 90 kilowatts in a rack. This has a bunch of implications, not just for power, but also for cooling. An inference box is somewhere in between; so a whole rack, maybe, is up to 40 kilowatts. Anay Shah (02:55:01): One of the things driving this power conversation we've been having is, again, not only the size of these data centers, but now the density of power required within these data centers. This is what makes an AI-driven data center so much different from a traditional data center. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:21): Just 20 of these training racks in a pod is one megawatt of power. That's on the order of a small, 800-person town powering electricity. So, if you get 200 of these racks, you get to an 8,000-person neighborhood very quickly. You get to a gigawatt of Seattle-scale power. Anay Shah (02:55:41): As you pack these GPUs that have higher power density, they run hotter, and you can't let them run hotter. So now, how you cool your GPUs and your racks needs to evolve. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:55): The problem is, air can only move heat so quickly. And if you were trying to do that, even with the inference racks, you would need leaf blower-level fans to move the air out. And so you need to start bringing more cooling down to the rack level. So the first thing that you can look at is retrofitting the racks with what's called rear door heat exchangers. This puts some water cooling directly alongside the rack so that when air is moving over those hot chips, some of that air, instead of just going straight into the hot aisle, can get extracted via some tubes of water running inside the rack. That is a nice convenient half-step because you don't have to change how you're actually cooling the overall system. The next jump is the jump to direct chip liquid cooling. This is where you mount cold plates directly on your chips and you run water right near the chip to actually extract the heat away, instead of expecting air and heat sinks to do it. And so, increasingly, especially with the most powerful GPUs—and to be clear, each generation of GPUs gets more powerful and therefore has more heat to remove—we are moving to a water-cooled world. Anay Shah (02:57:03): We've crossed the threshold of physics where air can cool this amount of heat being emitted at this level of density from the racks. And so now it is a liquid-cooling world. Now, at the end of the day, you've got to move the heat from inside to outside. But it's very environment-dependent. In the right climates, you can expel it outside. And that's why we saw some of these data centers looking at Finland and Oregon and certain geographies that enable that to happen. And this consumes very little water. But in other climates, you have large evaporated water cooling towers. This is where the problem of the water impact on the local community starts to come into play. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:57:45): Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is we're removing heat through that phase change, right? You're evaporating water; that's a massive transfer of heat. These towers increase the surface area of the water. Water evaporates out. It looks like steam going up from these cooling towers. And it's a very effective and efficient way to cool things down. But it can use up your water. Anay Shah (02:58:03): And so you end up with this energy-water trade-off in certain environments. And that becomes a big planning focus not only for data centers that are working with their local community, but also those that are power-constrained and built by companies that care about carbon intensity. One study Google did in 2022 found that water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy, which means they emit about 10% less carbon emissions than many of the air-cooled data centers. Now, the problem is, you can't do this as easily in water-stressed areas. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:58:38): So there's essentially this knob you can dial up and down. To be clear, it's possible to build data centers that don't use any water, but they're going to use more electricity to run an air conditioner in your house. You're not using a bunch of water, but you're taking a ton of energy. And so I would argue if we care about water, the best thing we can do is have clean electricity to make this an easier trade-off to make. Anay Shah (02:59:00): So if you zoom out and look at water, globally, data centers consume over 550 billion liters of water annually, which is a big number. To put that into context, a single 100-megawatt data center can consume 2 million liters a day, or the amount equivalent to 6,500 U.S. households per day, both direct and indirect water usage. So this is a very big, real, and current issue for data centers in terms of where they site their data center, how they get permitted, and the ongoing operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:59:35): The local question is hyper-important. Some reporting that The New York Times did about the situation in Georgia where, supposedly, when Meta broke ground on their billion-dollar data center build-out, water taps in some residents nearby went dry. And there's some back and forth around whether or not you can prove direct causality. Still working out whether or not that is actually the case, caused by that data center. But it is known to be true that that data center is using about 10% of the county's total water and it's driving water prices in the region to go up. Anay Shah (03:00:06): So now let's dive into what is the largest constraint to data center build-outs today, and that is power. We've talked about the evolution of power moving up the decision stack. From the early 2010s through the COVID era, and now in the AI era, power is really the limiting reagent. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:00:30): The image in my mind is: we have the largest, most complex machine that humankind has built in the power grid that has brought us such evolution in how we live our life. And it is colliding with the new, complex, most interesting machine of the data center. And this collision and the force of it that we're living through right now is defining this period. Anay Shah (03:00:53): And it is no small collision. It is a function of two things, right? It's a function of speed and a function of scale. So, as we've seen, there is an absolute arms race on compute, because the faster you can get compute online, the better your models are, the more revenue you're going to make. And timing matters a lot here because a model trained in 2025 can become obsolete by 2027. So if you have a two-year delay in getting your data center online because of the power grid, it becomes a dealbreaker. It has to happen now, coupled with the scale of these data centers. And so, as we talked about, a typical data center started as 5 to 10 megawatts. Then, just a few years ago, we were in the 50 to 100 megawatts. And now this year we're starting to see gigawatt-scale announcements. Now, to be clear, these are campuses that make up a gigawatt. There are multiple facilities, but they are still being built out cohesively and will put a strain on the grid and the local community at a gigawatt scale. Now, to put a gigawatt in perspective. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:00): This is the scale of a city's power consumption, right? Maybe a Pittsburgh or Cleveland. And Google's data center electricity use doubled over four years and was up to 30 million megawatt-hours in 2024 from 14 and a half million megawatt-hours in 2020. To put that all into perspective, that's about 3 million U.S. homes, or around three-quarters of a percent of all U.S. electricity consumption. Anay Shah (03:02:22): Which checks out, right? If data centers are currently about 4% of U.S. electricity use, I guess it makes sense that Google's about a fifth of that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:31): And it's worth pausing there for a second to talk about that 4% electricity use. When I hear that number, it actually seems shockingly small. For all of the discussion of data centers and electricity, it's like, okay, it's 4%. Let's say it goes to 8%. Compared to industry, compared to cooling and heating buildings. It all feels small. So why might this be such an issue of conflict? Anay Shah (03:02:54): It's a great question. It might have to do with the fact that it's misleading to think about it in terms of total national electricity use, because a data center has a localized and concentrated impact, right? You're not spreading this load across multiple utilities. And not only is it localized and concentrated, it's localized and concentrated in similar areas. Because, as we've been talking about, the network effect of the value of a data center being positioned near the undersea cables and near other network points is where you get a lot of performance gains. And so you end up concentrating yourself in Virginia, in California, in Texas. There's just basically 10 states where you're seeing new data centers come online. And so there's a tremendous impact at a local level—at the electricity prices for that community, that county, and in that state—but not necessarily at a national level. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:03:52): We talk gigawatt scale. That is all about these large training clusters. When we're talking about inference—which is, hey, ChatGPT, processing your response—you actually probably want that spread out, right? You want that closer to the edge, and that's where you need it close to the interconnect, because you want it to not have latency when interacting with the user and their data. Anay Shah (03:04:10): So let's talk a little bit about why you need a gigawatt data center or a 5-gigawatt data center to do the best training possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:04:17): You don't really want to think about it as one GPU or a rack of GPUs or a building of GPUs. You want, as much as possible, the whole data center to act together. Because the way that a transformer actually trains is that it makes guesses about what should come next, and then it compares that to reality, and then it tunes the weights across it. And you're doing that collectively across the whole model. And to do that, you need all of the computers working on the problem to be able to communicate quickly. Otherwise, the whole thing is training slowly. The faster those exchanges can happen, the better. And so you want the connectivity between chips to be as fast as possible. You want the connectivity between boxes of chips to be as fast as possible. And so it does not work if all of a sudden half of your computers are on the East Coast and half are on the West Coast, because the speed of light across the country is going to slow you down by multiple orders of magnitude than within one campus, within one center. And that's why Meta wants to build a 5-gigawatt campus because that's going to get them the biggest training model possible. Anay Shah (03:05:21): There's also an interesting nuance here where training models hit higher load factors than an inference model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:05:30): And in a typical data center, you're trying to run this all at once and you're utilizing ideally all your expensive chips. And so all of that leads to a higher utilization and more power and more compute. Anay Shah (03:05:43): So we talked about the speed. More time to power is time to revenue. We've talked about the scale, now going from 100 megawatts to gigawatts. So this creates an objective function when we're thinking about the power constraint on data center growth. And that ends up being: how do we secure large 24/7 power where you need it, when you need it, quickly and ideally as clean as possible? Should be easy, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:13): Oh, wait. Not to mention there are supply chain bottlenecks in transformers, bottlenecks in gas turbines, and bottlenecks— Anay Shah (03:06:20): In labor and in specialty skills. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:22): We don't have the most up-to-date, freshest grid with transmission lines. So this gets into a very tense moment and an area that arguably breeds innovation. Anay Shah (03:06:33): So the reality is, getting affordable power that is 24/7, quickly and cleanly, is going to be very rare. That Goldilocks situation doesn't really exist today. And so we're going to have to compromise on at least one of those variables. Now you've got a few different options to get these data centers online, right? You can either hook it up to the grid and use power that already exists. You can build new generation of power that's off the grid and power that data center, do some sort of hybrid in between, and over the long term, we can build out large new generation like nuclear, geothermal, and others. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:07:14): Watching this closely, there are both a lot of moments of concern, right, because we're at times doing things like keeping a coal plant running longer than we might have otherwise. But there are also a lot of interesting moments of innovation. A lot of growth in storage to help supplement what's going on and smooth out power generation, and co-locating these in new hybrid ways. Anay Shah (03:07:34): And there's a tension that's largely dictated by timing, right? There's a near-term pain that local communities are facing when you bring a data center online and potentially increase electricity prices. But there's also cause for optimism because you've got well-funded companies who have an interest in long-term sustainable power. And the fact of the matter is, the most affordable, long-term sustainable power we have is going to be clean and renewable. And so this moment actually offers an opportunity for us to accelerate a lot of new clean build on the grid and reshape our electricity infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:08:10): I think, at the end of the day, there's also a big issue of incentives. These hyperscalers, they want to build these models. Now, many of them are used to mostly still building their businesses on software-based timescales. And the reality is, despite all the discussion of the utilities and electricity, for them, it's a bottleneck. The actual cost of energy for them to build the biggest models is like 2 to 6%. It is all in the people and the hardware. It is all in the chips and the humans. And so for them, it's all, as you said earlier, this speed to getting out there. And that's not how our system is set up. That's not how our incentive structures are set up, right? Anay Shah (03:08:51): That's right, because the utility supplying that power operates on an entirely different paradigm. In a typical electric utility, power delivered in 2027 is valued at the same amount as power delivered in 2030. Utilities don't differentiate those products, but for the customer—a Google or Meta—there's a massive difference for their business. They need power today. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:17): How much more would they pay if they could get power now versus three years from now? Anay Shah (03:09:21): And how much could we unlock in terms of investment into our utilities if they could take advantage of the fact that companies are willing to pay a lot more today than in two years? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:31): Brian Janis calls this the Watt-bit spread. It's the economic arbitrage between an available Watt and the ability to turn that into a bit. Reality is, the speed of regulatory change in utility tariff pricing—which is a fancy way of saying how quickly the utility can change anything about their economics—is slow. And so despite there being an obvious market demand structure, it's not going to change in the next 12 months the way that utilities price their product. Anay Shah (03:10:03): Utilities are public goods, right? They power our lives and our schools and our hospitals. And so for good reason, they are regulated. But because they are regulated, they take time to change. And moreover, we have a federated system. We have some 3,000 different utilities across the United States. And so making that change across this country, or even in the 10 states where data centers are getting built out, will take a lot of time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:10:27): Power has become the dominant question of: where can you build your data center? Because you can't go do it without that. But it didn't remove the fact that the other questions still remain. For example, you need people to go build a data center; you need a lot of electricians; you need all the components and the supply chain and the things to build the transformers to step down the power. Anay Shah (03:10:48): Based on how we've been talking about this, you might think that data centers are almost entirely a U.S. story. And while the U.S. is the dominant builder of data centers, there is actually a global story here and global infrastructure being built out, and a strong need for sovereignty for other nations. So in order to help understand what's going on here, let's go back in time a little bit to understand the drama that's setting in globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:11:19): I think it's worth looking at just fairly recently. In 2018, Europe passed GDPR, and that set this world baseline for privacy. Thank you. All the cookie pop-ups, but also really tight controls on where EU data sits and what happens if you have EU resident data outside of the EU. And so this is really, I think, a reaction to where people are storing data about our citizens. And so there are controls about what happens if you're holding or transferring data outside of the EU. Anay Shah (03:11:51): In 2018, the U.S. passed the CLOUD Act, which essentially lets U.S. authorities lawfully demand data from U.S. providers, even if that data sits on servers outside of— Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:03): the U.S. And so the net effect is if you're working with EU data at scale, you start to need to have servers and hard drives in the EU. And this becomes, I think, almost another lock-in that the big cloud providers start to have because they go and build the infrastructure to do that. Anay Shah (03:12:19): And we saw this in the Microsoft story, right? A big part of their early scaling was following their enterprise customers globally and needing to build out data centers in Germany as one of the primary cases. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:31): And so if the EU-U.S. looks like a little tiff drama, I think it's time to move to the major geopolitical data center drama, which some have— Anay Shah (03:12:41): deemed the new Cold War. And there's a book called *The Chips War*, which centers around this notion of the U.S. and now China in a fight over everything. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:57): But centered on this technology, right? So, I mean, let's go back to 2012, which I think really kicked off this last decade. Fifteen years of animosity here. The House Intelligence Committee report warned U.S. carriers away from using Huawei and ZTE equipment, saying that we shouldn't use this in any sensitive government system. Now that, of course, starts to spiral outside of just government use. Anay Shah (03:13:21): That was first with the carriers. Beijing responded on a different front: the data front. So in 2017, China's Cybersecurity Law, followed by other laws, pushed data localization and tighter state control. And so the U.S. companies had to respond by localizing operations, which essentially means AWS, Apple, Azure: they either had to sell off to Chinese partners or find a Chinese government-linked company to be a partner. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:13:49): That's right. So it's not just that those companies' hard disks and servers had to be in China, but they actually had to be owned and operated by a Chinese company. And so then the U.S. reacted even further. They barred all federal agencies from buying or using equipment from a long list of covered Chinese vendors. And they barred the FCC from approving any new authorizations from Huawei, ZTE, and others. So this just ramped up further and further. Anay Shah (03:14:14): This brewing war was not just limited to land, but also involves our friends, the undersea cables. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:21): Right. Anay Shah (03:14:21): And so in 2016, Google and Facebook partnered with a Hong Kong-based company to build the Pacific Light Cable Network, a massive 12,000-kilometer undersea cable linking Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Part of that global network of undersea cables we were talking about earlier. Seems like a great idea. What could go wrong? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:44): And fast forward four years later, to 2020. U.S. national security officials say, "We don't know about this Hong Kong landing point anymore." We think that's going to be a vehicle for Beijing to have surveillance across this important backbone of the internet. And so the FCC ultimately blocked that route. And so now the cable hits Taiwan and the Philippines, and those are lit up. But the Hong Kong branch that's been laid, I believe, is just lying dark. Anay Shah (03:15:10): So I'm sitting here in Los Angeles without that cable to Hong Kong. Now, moving back to land and to chips. The battle continues. And so in 2022, the Commerce Department rolls out these sweeping controls on advanced AI chips and fab tools. And so, remember, this is the moment where we've gone through a COVID boom. We're seeing an uptake in usage from crypto and streaming. And now AI, and the Commerce Department tightens these controls again in 2023 and again in 2024. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:15:43): And this feels very active, right? I mean, literally every quarter of Nvidia's earnings, there are discussions of this. A few weeks ago, the U.S. opened a channel that said Nvidia could ship certain chips that are dialed back, like the H20. But they have to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of the revenue. It's a pretty unprecedented pay-to-export arrangement, like a lot of things that are unprecedented that are going on. But if you zoom out, it raises some good geopolitical strategic questions on how we want to engage, right? Anay Shah (03:16:11): Yeah. It's foundational to the new economy that's being built on this advanced compute power. And it remains to be seen how this plays out. It may backfire. Right. China is not terribly keen on being dependent on U.S. production, so they are infusing massive amounts of capital in their chip sector. It's still a step behind Nvidia in terms of raw performance and software ecosystem dominance. But given China's resources, you have to assume that that gap is going to narrow and narrow quickly. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:16:46): There's a reason China wanted domestic energy. They want to have their own domestic production of silicon here, and so they've invested heavily and they're catching up. Some estimates are that they're 60 to 70% of Nvidia performance; it depends on what they're doing. But they're investing out of a $50 billion fund to improve chip development. Even more so, they're passing policy that says data centers need to source at least 50% of their chips domestically. So they're making sure to really stand up not just the supply side of the market, but also simultaneously the demand side of the market. Anay Shah (03:17:17): The story is less about whether Chinese chips can equal Nvidia's top-end designs and more about how quickly that's going to happen given the demand and the capital that they're putting in. So in short, at the moment, the US is still ahead, but the China chip ecosystem is accelerating rapidly. Their backlog of demand for Nvidia chips, which is being withheld, is going to matter less and less over time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:17:43): The other dynamic that you have geopolitically is governments are seeing the AI data center boom as an important future part of their economy. A deal that exemplifies this is the Emirates deal with OpenAI around this UAE Stargate buildout, a one-gigawatt AI cluster in Abu Dhabi, and all the ecosystem players from Oracle to Nvidia to Cisco to SoftBank coming in to finance this and collaborating on the buildout. I think it just raises a lot of interesting questions: What about the location of a data center matters to a government? Anay Shah (03:18:16): And the map is stark. If you look at where AI data centers are located today, only 32 nations have them, and most of them are in the Northern Hemisphere. You have large swaths of Latin America and Africa as fully dark. Governments are deeply, deeply concerned because they are wondering that if you continue to rent compute power from faraway data centers, you remain at the whims and you remain vulnerable to foreign entities and foreign companies, and you aren't able to support domestic enterprise or domestic scientific research or academia with the same level of control. So this idea of compute sovereignty is top of mind for a lot of people, and a lot of emerging markets are worried that the AI era runs the risk of leaving them even further behind economically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:09): There's almost a rough analogy to energy independence, right? Do you have it regardless of your relationship with another country? That feels like the important thread here. Anay Shah (03:19:18): The other tricky dimension here, which if you talk a little bit about, is the actual impact on the climate, which gets a lot of attention these days, rightly so. There are a few questions that continue to come up, and one that Ben, maybe your mom has asked you, I know mine has, is if a ChatGPT query is bad for the climate. If I care about the climate, should I really be using AI? And we have some data on that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:44): There's been some reporting on this, and I think it's an area that's become a pretty hot-button issue for folks. There's been, I think, some people even shaming others for using these tools because of the climate impact. So it's worth looking at the latest numbers. Google actually just put out a publicly readable paper on Gemini where they go down to the details on the energy consumption and the carbon intensity of that energy. The median Gemini text prompt, which for all intents and purposes I think could be viewed as fairly equivalent to a Claude or a ChatGPT or a Copilot prompt, uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy and emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent and consumes 0.26 milliliters or about five drops of water. Those are figures that are substantially lower than what the public estimates have been. For some kind of sense of scale, that per-prompt energy impact is about the same as watching your TV for less than nine seconds. Why do we think the public reporting might be so far off? Anay Shah (03:20:40): There have been a lot of improvements over time, and so it's important to kind of ground ourselves in this moment. We know, through that same report, that the AI systems that we're using are becoming more efficient. There's constant innovation in the software and the hardware to drive more efficiency. So over 12 months, the energy of a standard Gemini text prompt dropped by 33-fold. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:04): Wow. Anay Shah (03:21:05): A 33x improvement in the energy consumption. Even more so, from a total carbon footprint per se, we have 44x, all while delivering higher quality responses. So we are moving in a world where the efficiency gains are continuing, and this question of "is your query bad for the climate?" is fairly insignificant. Hannah Ritchie from Our World in Data has independently corroborated this fact. It's an interesting cocktail conversation, but largely misses the forest from the trees. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:37): I think the pressure is good positive pressure because one individual query you should not feel bad about. But the pressure for all of these companies to monitor this and drive these numbers down and get these efficiency improvements is a fantastic thing. That's right. And to drive the deployment of clean energy so that the carbon intensity of the energy drives down is a good flywheel to keep pressure on. Anay Shah (03:21:56): Indeed. So, Mom, keep asking a question because Google will then continue to improve. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:00): I think there's another area that's been under-discussed. Anay Shah (03:22:03): You don't hear a lot of discussion on the actual carbon intensity of building these very large pieces of infrastructure, pieces of real estate. That's called embodied carbon. So what is the embodied carbon impact of the steel, the cement, the energy used to build a shell and stand up the facility in and of itself? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:27): Thankfully, Google did another report on this and shared that in their analysis. Running an AI data center, the operational emissions, which really means the energy going into running the data center ongoing, is going to be about 70 to 90% of the total emissions. Manufacturing emissions, which is really the manufacturer of the server components, the memory, the flash storage, the GPUs, is going to be around 25%. And then the data center construction, so this is the steel and cement and the logistics around that, are around 5%. So this is all to say, I think when you look at this, we should probably be paying a bit more attention to the manufacturing of the components and make sure that we're looking at the LCAs for solid-state disk drives and GPUs and making sure we're taking that into account. But the attention's probably correctly centered on the electricity. Anay Shah (03:23:14): And on this point of focusing in on the manufacturing, the procurement muscle of one of these companies that are building this out is actually a very big leverage. So when Microsoft requires its suppliers to use 100% carbon-free energy by 2030, it will pull their suppliers, all the fab building and the motherboard building and the assemblers. It's moving everyone down the supply chain — it's called Scope 3 emissions — into a cleaner world, which has tremendous power. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:23:43): I think the other thing that's interesting is some of the circularity conversations are starting to happen. So I was at a talk where the Microsoft CSO was talking about how they recently launched, I think it was just in April of this year, a circularity program where they would take the rare earth material in the hard disk drives that they're using in the data centers, and they have a new way to recycle those while disposing of the data. That yields a 90% recovery of those rare earth materials, which also helps stand up a US supply chain around rare earth materials, which we don't really have today, which is pretty phenomenal. Anay Shah (03:24:13): Yeah. Tremendous. And it's going to be a growing discussion over the coming years as we mine for more and more of these critical minerals and the geopolitical control over who has those minerals. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:24:25): All right, so given all of that operational load, is the main contributor to greenhouse gases something like 70% or more of the emissions? How should we think about the scale of that from a meta-climate perspective? Anay Shah (03:24:38): So when we talk about operations, remember we're talking about the energy consumption and not the materials that go into building the data center. Recent studies show that data centers account for about 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. And with more than half of that electricity derived from fossil fuels, that means that data centers generate more than 105 million tons of CO2 every year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:04): Until reading the study, I didn't realize that data centers' carbon intensity is actually higher than average, exceeding the U.S. average by 48%. Anay Shah (03:25:12): The big point here is how grid-dependent that impact is. If these data centers are located on a dirtier grid, let's say a coal-heavy grid in the Mid-Atlantic region of Virginia, then it's going to have a very different climate profile than a data center that's in Eastern Washington that's entirely powered by hydro. So when we talk about 105 million tons of CO2, how should we think about that? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:36): A few comparisons to help think about the scale of 105 million tons of CO2 emissions. One is you look at US aviation emissions: this is about half of that. Another would be looking at enteric methane, which is a fancy way of saying cow burps, is around 178 million tons. So that means data centers are about 60% of the equivalent of that. Or all US passenger vehicles are 1,000 million tons, or a gigaton. And so data centers are about 10% of that today. Now, if you look globally, this goes up by approximately a factor of three, as do the rest of these things. So overall, data centers are not insignificant. They're worth tracking on the map here, but quite fractional compared to passenger vehicles, big emitters like livestock, and a third to a half of something like global aviation. The interesting thing, I think, what makes this a hot topic, is not just the current scale, but the projections, right? If all of a sudden we double on our current grid in the US, then now we're caught up to the emissions of aviation in the U.S. And if you keep going from that and you keep the trend line up, you could imagine data centers becoming a fairly dominant story in emissions. Anay Shah (03:26:50): The other leg of the stool in this conversation is how it's affecting the local communities that these data centers are being placed in. One of the themes that we've found come out through this is the impact of these data centers are concentrated and they are disproportionately felt by the environment, the ecology, and the people that immediately surround it. We metaphorically went to Memphis, where XAI is building a very large data center on the banks of the Mississippi, 15 minutes from downtown. And there, Elon is commissioning a 200,000 GPU unit data center. There's been a significant backlash from the Memphis community for good reason. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:27:37): I think a lot of it centers on how are we going to provide power to that? Because the utility said that they can provide XAI power for about 50 megawatts of load, but XAI wants triple that amount. That's a lot of GPUs, and 50 megawatts isn't going to cut it. So they brought in gas turbines — 35 turbines — which could theoretically power 420 megawatts. The problem with that — I mean, it's good they're solving their power problem — but the other problem with that is these are highly polluting gas turbines. So they have the potential to emit a couple thousand tons of smog-forming nitrous oxides each year. For context, that's more than the smog caused by the Memphis airport. So it's like you're adding another airport of smog to the region. Anay Shah (03:28:18): And this impact is not continuous, right, because these data centers ebb and flow in terms of how much power they are consuming. So it's important to look at these peak moments. We found public satellite data from NASA and the European Space Agency that shows that, on average, nitrogen dioxide concentration increased by 3% when comparing for a year before in this area. But in the times of peak consumption, we're talking about a 79% increase in nitrogen dioxide concentration from pre-XAI levels in that area. So you can imagine it's like sitting in a traffic jam, and those moments have outsized impact on the community at that moment in time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:00): Yeah. And so there's been a lot of pushback from this pollution and health risk standpoint. It's hitting South Memphis neighborhoods that already have elevated asthma and cancer rates from past industrial waste. This temporary electricity generation infrastructure isn't going to sustain in the long term. So all of this is kind of a case study in both the local impacts and also the time-to-power issue. Anay Shah (03:29:24): And this notion of time to power, essentially what it means is there is enough demand to get these data centers online quickly. The companies are willing to pay more and more. So when you have that kind of economic pressure, the community resistance sometimes can only go so far. As we're seeing in this case, XAI, despite the pressures, is currently building out a second location a few miles away, which will be double the size. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:50): Of the first: half a million of these GPUs. Anay Shah (03:29:53): I mean, just insane. That's the current moment we're living in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:59): So far we've been trying to keep it focused on what has been built more than what is proposed. But I think it's worth taking an extreme view on some of what's coming. Meta has announced their big long-term project, their big training center, the Hyperion project, located in Richland Parish, Louisiana. It's a $10 billion buildout, online by 2030. They'll have a few steps in between. The goal is for this to be a five-gigawatt canvas covering over 2,000 acres. Anay Shah (03:30:28): What is 2,000 acres? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:30:29): Yeah. So a different way to visualize this is this data center is about the size of Lower Manhattan. It is at a scale that is kind of unfathomable, right? That we're going to build buildings of that scale in a few years here to power such a new technology. Anay Shah (03:30:48): That Louisiana project is a great example of what we are living, the step-change function that we are living through right now. This is the biggest tech infrastructure project since either the 1960s, the dawn of the computer age, or even the 1880s, the heyday of the railroad period. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:31:09): I think Nvidia is on pace to capture the highest share of market-wide capital spending since IBM peaked in their percentage of that in 1969. And so a lot of comparisons are being made to other past booms like the Gilded Age or the telco buildout. Anay Shah (03:31:25): And when you mentioned booms, obviously you end up thinking about busts, right? So we talked about the telecom boom of the 1990s, which contributed to the dot-com crash and a bust on fiber. You also look back at the 1870s and the huge railroad boom that led to a crash, and both of these pose the question of, like, did we overbuild? Are we outrunning our demand? In both of those cases, it's not that the CapEx spenders were wrong; they were just early. We saw this vividly in the fiber overbuild. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:00): Right. Anay Shah (03:32:01): By the year 2000, we were only using 3% of the fiber we had laid. But it was absolutely necessary to power the next couple decades. And that's what it looks like for AI is that there may be an overbuild in this moment, but the foundational nature of this technology suggests that it's going to get utilized. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:20): Yeah, I think there's such a rush here because the potential AI market creates this economic imperative to go and plug in as many GPUs as quickly as possible, and that will build the largest and smartest AI model, which will create a moat. I think there's an interesting question here, though, of what is the infrastructure? Because yes, we still use the railroad tracks and we still use the fiber, but remember that all the companies that were building the fiber and the ones that were on top of that, it was too early for them to capture that value. But what's in part different about this boom is how it's being funded now. Yes, there are VC dollars and other dollars going into it, but at least historically, and if you look at the major capital expense, it is these big companies we've spent the episode talking about — it is Amazon, Microsoft, Google buying from Nvidia. And they're using the fact that their business models have thrown off billions and billions of dollars every quarter to then go buy the chips and build this out. So there's a real kind of concentration in some of the buildout of the infrastructure. Anay Shah (03:33:20): Those previous boom-busts financed by the banks end up drawing in the rest of the economy. And while there are some private credit actors and venture capitalist actors, because it's largely financed by free cash flow of these private companies, a bust hurts them, which will drag down the stock market, but is hopefully insulating the rest of the capital providers that are not involved. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:33:43): There is supposedly now more private credit starting to come in to fund this, and that could create linkages to other parts of the system. We will see how that plays out. We've talked about the story of data centers up until present day. Let's zoom out for a second and talk about just where we are today from a sense of scale. Anay Shah (03:34:04): Let's start with the most basic question: How many data centers exist today? There are globally approximately 11,800 data centers worldwide. Now, of course, the counting of this gets nuanced when you think about the closets that still exist with servers as they did back in the day. But by and large, we're talking about independent construction. And the US is by far the largest with over 5,000 data centers, followed by Germany, the UK, China, and Canada. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:34:33): So the US has almost half the data centers. Wow. Anay Shah (03:34:36): Yeah, heavy concentration in the U.S. Obviously other countries are catching up. China is building very quickly. So this begs the question of who owns all of these 11,000 data centers and who's spending these hundreds of billions of dollars. And you can kind of think of it in four broad categories. That's representative of the US but also it fits globally. And so the first category are our friends, the colocation centers, the ones we've talked about: Equinix, Digital Realty, and others. There are about a dozen of these that are building 10 to 100 megawatt blocks in the US and around the world. The second category are the hyperscalers: the Facebooks, Amazons, Microsofts; you can add in Apple, Oracle in there. They account for almost half of global data center capacity, and they're the lion's share of new growth. But importantly, you still have thousands of private server rooms in banks and retail facilities and public institutions that are out there. So while large in count, they're relatively smaller in capacity, but today still make up about 35%. And finally, you've got legacy telcos that are still owning and operating data centers. Now the interesting thing about this is the trend, right? You're seeing enterprise and public sector data centers trending down, and new build increasingly going to hyperscalers and these purpose-built colocation facilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:35:54): So how much actual physical real estate space are all of these data centers taking up? This is like anything that gets into this level of detail. It can be hard to pull exact numbers, but one reasonable estimate is that maybe there's one and a half billion square feet globally in data center buildout. For context, if you took an average median US home of around 2,200 square feet, that's around 730,000 of those homes of square footage, or 28,000 football fields. Anay Shah (03:36:20): Importantly, including end zones. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:24): That feels like a big number. But for some comparison to some other infrastructure in our life: If you just took the U.S. interstate system, so this is, you know, I-5, I-90, the big interstates, just the asphalt of those interstates is 10 times the square footage. So let's talk about power. Anay Shah (03:36:40): Remember the impact of data centers on power: it's quite localized and concentrated to its physical location. But let's talk about it in a sense of scale. We mentioned that in the US it's about 4.5% of total electricity. That's roughly 17 million households' annual use. How can I conceive of that power? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:59): Yeah, I think if you look at the electricity consumption of the city of New York, it's about three New Yorks to power all the data centers in the US. Or if you look at all data centers globally, it's about equivalent to the power consumption of the United Kingdom. If you look at other comparable industries, it's pretty close to the power consumption of the chemical industry or the primary metals industry. This is extracting iron ore and smelting aluminum. Anay Shah (03:37:26): Similarly, on the water question, there's a tremendous amount of nuance in how to aggregate total water consumption. But let's just do the average of the average. Let's take direct water for cooling, indirect water from the power generated for the plant, and get a sense of how much water this is using US data. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:37:45): Centers together consume about 250 million gallons of water per day. That's about a quarter of what the city of New York uses. Anay Shah (03:37:53): So we've talked about the space, the data centers, how many of them, who owns them, how is it being powered and cooled? What's actually inside of them? Let's think about the scale of the compute power. It's actually a little bit difficult to figure out what humanity's overall compute power is, but let's just say there are about 50 to 100 million servers globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:13): Yeah. And so, I think the best way to get at this was to go back to the electricity usage numbers and then look at how much compute power we get per unit of electricity. What's surprising here is that if you run the numbers, we've grown humanity's compute power around 40x over the last decade, but have only grown power consumption about two and a half times because we've gotten more efficient. And if you look at that new compute power that's come online, only around 10% of data centers are AI-focused today. Of course, that's a growing percentage. Anay Shah (03:38:45): So compute power is one part of what the data center is doing. Let's give a sense of the scale on storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:51): Yeah. So in the last decade, we've 3x to 4x total installed storage capacity to around 15 zettabytes. Anay Shah (03:38:57): And so we're speaking to a friend of the show, Byron, who made me understand the modern marvel of hard drives. So imagine the head of the hard drive is scaled up to the size of a Boeing 747. It's flying at 560 miles an hour, and it is about the thickness of one piece of paper above a football field. That hard drive head is reading and writing to every single blade of grass moving at 560 miles an hour. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:27): That is absolutely insane. And so we have all these hard drives and all this compute. Now they're connected via these submarine cables. How many of those do we have? Anay Shah (03:39:34): We have approximately 600 active submarine cables that are powering 99% of international usage on the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:45): So in total, we're about 100 times the global bandwidth that we were a decade ago. And we've seen internet bandwidth continue to grow 25% year over year. Anay Shah (03:39:53): And so these numbers are today's snapshot. Now, there are a lot of projections out there of where growth is going to go over the next five years. It can get fairly outlandish, but suffice to say, growth is continuing to accelerate now and in the years to come. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:40:10): All right, well, we talked about Byron's plane reading and writing blades of grass. Now it's time to land our plane. Anay, let's do the themes. What did you realize bubbled up for you over the course of this research and conversation? Anay Shah (03:40:24): It's been a journey. I did not know a lot coming in and have learned way more about the ins and outs of data centers than I ever imagined. A few big things will continue to stick with me. One of the first books we read is called *Tubes*, and it's this nonfiction, nerdy detective story to discover where this thing called the internet lives. It turns out the cloud is quite physical, but even more interesting, it's strangely concentrated. The internet has almost infinite edges, but it's got a shockingly small number of centers and has been built in this hub-and-spoke structure. And so for me, that starts with May East, right? Ashburn, Virginia, home to 13% of global data capacity and has once carried north of 30% of the world's internet traffic. That is the undisputed capital of the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:41:25): And it's so wild that that became the hub just by being the hub. There's just this center of gravity that spiraled on itself, a black hole of data center investment, almost by accident, right? Yeah. Anay Shah (03:41:38): The internet's structure is based on this mesh connectivity of global cities on coastal shores. It's Virginia, New York, D.C., London, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Seoul, Lagos, all connected by these 600 undersea cables that are literally powering the world's economy. And so I think about data centers that started off occupying closets, growing to whole floors, then buildings, then warehouses. And I start to think of the cloud as a building, as a factory, where a bit comes in, gets massaged, gets put together in the right way, and then it gets sent out to its destination, and it really brings the internet home. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:42:21): For me, this connects to one of my reflections, which is threaded through the invisibility of this infrastructure and what makes data centers and the connecting internet almost the perfect abstracted infrastructure. And what I mean by that is you can access them, you can use them, you can get all of the power of them without ever seeing them or touching them. Now, with us living in a mostly wirelessly blanketed internet ourselves, you have access to all of these warehouses and all these buildings via all these undersea cables. And if you're an engineer developing software, you can deploy to all these regions around the world and never actually look at a CPU or a hard drive in your life. It is, I think, the best-abstracted physical infrastructure that humanity has built. It is physical, it is silicon, it is electricity, it is fiber. There is no real magic. It is all physics. But the only infrastructure I can think of in humanity that is as well abstracted is maybe money, but money is actually not physical anymore. In the same way, this actually is still doing physical work. And that struck me. Anay Shah (03:43:34): It does. It feels very rare to have global infrastructure that is defining our life and how the world operates, to be so. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:43:44): Invisible, and so frequently in our life. Even though it is invisible, our entire day is mediated by this infrastructure. But if your entire day is spent on the train, you're very aware of where the tracks are, and you can see them, and you're on the train. That's the engine, right? Anay Shah (03:44:01): Even fire, we probably used it selectively throughout the day. The railroads, we got on and off. The car, we got in and out of. Electricity, we turned the lights on and off. This is a modern marvel that we're only not using when we sleep. And even then, it's doing stuff for us. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:20): It's tracking my sleep. I'm wearing a ring that's tracking my sleep, sending bits to Oura's servers. Yeah, as you were saying that, it's like you're getting on and off a train. You're kind of turning electricity on and off in a transactional moment. This is almost more like you're living in it, right? You're living in this infrastructure, but we never see it. Anay Shah (03:44:44): I just had a flash of *Ready Player One*. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:46): Yes. Anay Shah (03:44:47): Putting on the full suit and immersing myself in another reality. We're close, when you think about it this way. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:54): I think that's right. I think this gets to one of my other realizations when comparing this to other physical infrastructure, which is, despite it being truly physical—buildings and silicon and electricity—we are upgrading it continuously and rapidly. Part of that is because of Moore's Law. Part of that is because of the improvement of the hardware and our techniques for cooling and all of these things. But I feel that with most other infrastructure, you get to, "Okay, this is a reasonably good way to build a train track. Now we need to go build more of it," or, "This is a reasonably good way to transport electricity. So now we're going to build more transmission." And certainly you get a little bit better at transmission, but we don't just get a little bit better here. We're getting 40x better. In the last decade, which was off the previous decade, it's gotten much better. So it's this weird thing where, yes, it's infrastructure, but it is changing what it is. We're getting at such an order of magnitude scale so quickly. And I can't think of other analogies to that. Maybe the first 20, 30 years of electricity felt like this, but this feels... something feels even more drastic here because what is being delivered is not commoditized exactly the same way as electricity. Anay Shah (03:46:02): That sense of movement that you're describing reminds me of another one of my takeaways, which is where I'm feeling stuck. And that's on the question of power. To me, it's easy to think about the complexities of why the power problem is so hard to solve, and yet the answers are right in front of us. The problem is huge, right? Data centers are pulling more and more electricity from the grid. The problem is hard because the grid is strained, the turbines and transformers are backlogged, and we don't really have utilities that are built to capture the incentive structures to value what hyperscalers are willing to pay today. And it's going to take years to reform the grid to actually meet the needs. And at the same time, the fastest, cheapest energy is available today. It's solar, storage, putting renewable energy online quickly and cheaply. That is already accounting for 90% of new capacity going on the grid. Despite every effort from our current administration to execute an ideological war on clean power and claim that we're in some national energy emergency, and yet deny the grid affordable electrons being placed on it. So if we can just get out of our own way, we can put a lot of power on the grid fairly quickly. The other side of that story is the way we're building data centers: accounting for 24/7 peak load. And there's a famous study that circulated earlier this year from Duke University that suggested that if we can limit grid-facing power of data centers by just 1% a year—90 hours out of the entire year—we can unlock 100 gigawatts of load. We can unlock the equivalent of two nuclear fleets on the US energy grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:47:54): Right. You saw Google do some recent announcements where they're collaborating with some of the utility providers to do exactly that. There are new startups that we see all the time that are building businesses around that concept. This connects really closely to my major takeaway on the power story, which is that limitations drive innovation, especially when they come up against a legacy incumbent system—something that generally works, and reasonably well. Which for all of our general disgruntledness about utilities in our life, it is phenomenal that the electricity works most of the time as well as it does. And it has not gotten a kick in the behind in a long time in terms of needing to try and evolve. There have been decades of people talking about a smarter grid, but nothing's forced the need like the AI data center competition and the geopolitical competition with China, which drives innovation across the stack. It's exactly what you're saying in terms of driving the next cheap, clean electron on the grid in the forms of renewable energy. But it's also pushing us on transmission and permitting, and it's also pushing us inside the data center to think even further about AI models. And we've invested in companies that improve the efficiency of actually running and training the model. Anay Shah (03:49:12): That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:12): And so up and down this whole stack, a point we found again from talking to people and from research, these types of crunches drive efficiency innovation and the evolution of the grid. Anay Shah (03:49:24): And arguably, according to folks who have been in this for decades, we've been fairly lazy on innovation. It's been a lot of low-hanging fruit. And so this type of forcing function can drive step-change improvements in something as complicated as our national grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:41): So to me, all of that points to long-term optimism: first, in solving the problems, but second, in solving them in a way that leads to more clean energy deployment. However, it also means needing to recognize and not dismiss the near-term local impacts for both power and water in these environments. Anay Shah (03:50:01): I love that point because as we talked through these stories, that theme kept recurring of how it is different when you think about the problem locally than when you think about the problem nationally. And I think that's really important for people to understand as this is more and more headline news. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:50:16): My personal takeaway is less and less anxiety about that next incremental Gemini Query, ChatGPT, Anthropic use case or storing a video, and a greater desire to have more awareness locally within a given county that's struggling with air quality or water shortages. Because that's where activism needs to center within communities in the moment, rather than trying to slow the valuable uses and progress that we're all building toward. Anay Shah (03:50:45): Absolutely. This point on communities and geography and where things are located brings up another takeaway that's close to my heart as a former international politics major and someone who spent 20 years living and working across emerging markets. And that's the geopolitical implications of the moment we're living through right now. And so we talked a little bit about this, but to me, it really crystallizes into a twofold idea: One is the notion that we're living through this chip war, right? That microchips have replaced oil as one of the world's most critical resources and it's a key determinant of economic and military power. And we're in a new Cold War. This time, it's largely with China. As Americans, we don't want a country like China accessing our data or having superior performance over us. And so we're actively preventing US companies from selling chips to China. But it's not so straightforward, right? Because you think of, "Okay, Nvidia as an American company, we can prevent that." But Nvidia is the architect of the chips, right? The manufacturer of over 90% of the world's advanced chips is a Taiwanese company, TSMC, and they're the ones actually constructing it. So this geopolitical tension has various layers to it, but the notion that we're living through a new Cold War and the chip is the center of that story is quite striking. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:07): I think in the long term, or mid to long term, this type of technology is a genie that can't be put back into the bottle. China, in particular, is hyper-aware of what they want to domestically build for themselves here and actually is in a great position from a supply chain perspective to pull that off. Even if they're a couple years behind. You've seen them spin up AI labs, spin up their own domestic chip manufacturing, and do impressive jobs. And you can say, "Well, 18 months ahead," but what is that in the scale of this foundational technology? Anay Shah (03:52:40): Yeah, 18 months is a blink of an eye. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:42): I lean again toward long-term optimism that this competition creates good incentives for us to rethink our fundamental constraints, which are mostly on the clean energy deployment side. One big thing China has going for it that we don't have is its ability to grow generation of clean energy much, much faster than we do in the US. Again, because of their solar panel supply chain, their battery supply chain. Anay Shah (03:53:07): Their government structure, their ability to build, is unmatched. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:53:11): And so this is giving a lot of our structures a kick to rethink what's slowing us down. If this is so existentially important to stay at least on par, if not ahead on. Anay Shah (03:53:22): I agree strongly. In this notion of the chip war, I think it's interesting. In this moment, I think over the medium to long term, it's less. So here's where I don't share as much optimism: the AI boom and data center build-out that's potentially creating a new digital divide, exacerbating global inequality on yet another dimension. So we've talked about how US hyperscalers run almost 50% of data center compute. The U.S., China, and the European Union host more than half of all powerful data centers. What does that mean for the billions of other people living around the world? And what is the implication for a country that is renting compute power from a faraway data center? It's potentially higher costs, slower connection speeds, and compliance to different laws. But more importantly, as we unpack this—as we're trying to wrestle with this idea—it's this question of having a critical national security and economic infrastructure input owned, operated, and housed outside of your control. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:54:28): The techno-optimist in me is just screaming to refute this, and I'll tell you why. And I think we can study the internet as an example. This feeds into, I think, another meta theme for us, which is that these companies are the modern-day utilities, but they're actually the opposite in a way of the governing structure of an electricity utility, which is hyper-localized and granted local monopoly. These are global utilities. They're providing much more non-commodity functionality, everything down to a bespoke AI model that they're training, down to more commodity storage. And the business model of a utility is to, as we've seen again and again, provide more as cheaply as possible to as many customers as possible. And you've seen the biggest internet companies grow by incentivizing and subsidizing free services to more and more people. And that has led to a lot of the world getting connected that was not connected just 10 years ago. There's reason to be cynical about what Google and Meta are doing, trying to get more of the world connected. Don't they just want more customers? Obviously, yes, they want more customers. But in doing so, a lot more of the world has access to the internet than ever before, and information and knowledge. And I think that's where I fall on the side of optimism: that there's nothing more that OpenAI wants than more people having access to OpenAI. Now, that to me goes to the individual human level, which is very different than how a nation-state or the government in control of a nation-state might feel about it. But I lean on the individual human in a global context, and what powers I want them and their children to have in the decades to come. And that's where I get a source of optimism. Anay Shah (03:56:07): I mean, it's true. Sixty-six-plus percent of the world's population is now connected to the internet, and that number is increasing. I like the optimism. I wonder if the nature of this technology, particularly AI compute power, functions differently than access to the internet, access to electricity, and access to other similar infrastructures—having that controlled by private equity and public companies that have very specific incentive structures. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:56:39): I think there's a big thing that you just hit on for me, which is my optimism doesn't really account for the hosting government of hyperscalers. And so it's not just that these are companies, but they're American companies. If they're American companies, they exist a little bit at the pleasure of the American government. And that means that another country's access to them exists at the pleasure of the American government. And that, I think, gets to a more complex nuance, and to me, it just drives value to the idea of more global models and more global competition, even if it's not hosted within a given country, so that it's not just one or two governments that have control over these technologies. Anay Shah (03:57:22): More models trained on different languages, of course, and different speech patterns. And so, how this unregulated utility—as we're talking about, this new digital utility, this new critical infrastructure that society will increasingly depend on—will continue to be seen as a public good and delivered to more and more people as that... You know, they say hindsight is 20/20, but there's something even more interesting about creating a historical narrative to something like data centers. And it's the marvel of the narrative process, this story, that starts to make so much sense of how one thing came after another. So you start off with IBM and Watson's journey and the introduction of the punch card that is storing data, and then the machines that start to compute off that storage, and that grows and evolves. And you've got the Cold War introducing the need for connecting networks, and suddenly you've got compute and storage power. Network connections bring that together, and that continues to evolve. And then you get the explosion of the '90s. And in this time, first slightly accidental and then more purposeful infrastructure starts to get built in very important nodes, and the fiber boom happens. I think I'll now always associate the late '90s with the overbuild of fiber and this notion that by the time the dot-com bust happened, we only used 3% of the fiber that we built. It's wild. And yet that was exactly what we needed to go through the run-up of the 2000s and the growth of consumer and enterprise internet, mobile, and streaming, and then eventually the cloud. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:10): And then you had crypto creating this market for the AI chips before we had the models. Cycles of building ahead of the curve, there being some bust, but then there being this new utilization of those fundamental building blocks. Anay Shah (03:59:22): Absolutely. And these brilliant people located within very important companies that took the lead to build what is now foundational infrastructure for the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:34): And then there's another dance that's happening—in where storage and compute lives for the average consumer or average business—where you go from it being all on the mainframe. Then it moves eventually to the PC. And you feel so powerful with your PC, but you have no collaboration, no backup, no redundancy. Then it moves back to the server room. Then in the mobile era, your connection is really slow. Early days, you think about the first iPhone: it was a really slow edge connection. So your phone actually had to do most of the stuff on the phone. But now we live in this world where the connection's back, fat, and happy. And so we do everything now on the server except for rendering the UI on the phone. And so this dance—of where both compute and storage happens, mediated by the communication bandwidth—is a really interesting dance that I see played out in the story. Anay Shah (04:00:26): That dance then drove the cloud boom of the 2010s and the maturing of enterprise cloud and infrastructure, where now you're able to do everything you want at higher and higher utilization in the cloud. And all of that build-out, and that fine-tuning and optimization, allowed us to enter March of 2020—the dark days of the beginning of the pandemic—and switch over from in-person to online from the perspective of the internet, largely without much of a hiccup. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:04): Yeah, going to slightly lower resolution Netflix videos for a month. I think we handled it pretty well from a technology infrastructure perspective. Anay Shah (04:01:13): Correct. And how that just so happened to juice the infrastructure even more, to lay the foundation for GPUs to finally be utilized for what was growing in the background: machine learning and large language model training. And then November of 2022, putting a chatbot on top of a model, and the AI boom and the infrastructure that was laid to capture that moment, and the cash coffers of the hyperscalers that were ready to meet that moment, are now propelling the greatest technological infrastructure build-out in human history. What a story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:59): Yeah. Do you think it's an overbuild? Anay Shah (04:02:02): There are things that I worry about in this world, as we noted from the geopolitical situation, but once I strap in, the optimist in me takes over. So I am fully convinced that we will utilize every photon, electron, and square footage. I hope that this is the opportunity where we collectively can seize the moment to get more clean, firm power online, more affordable power online, and where we can use technology and renewable power to reduce the depletion of water resources in critical areas. The opportunity to build a newly-skilled workforce to build out this new infrastructure. The opportunity to modernize our aging grid, our transmission lines, the way we do siting and permitting, the way we do environmental review processes, the way utilities are incentivized to meet demand. The opportunity to spur local economic development in communities all over the country, and in the world. The opportunity to have large enterprises build out infrastructure that will be a net benefit to the consumer where they're locating their assets. And I think it's really important for us to be mindful of the cost of moving so quickly and not thinking through the implications of water, power, climate, communities, and global equity. And my real hope is that when you have this much capital and this much demand coming on to reshape a foundational technological infrastructure, we come out the other end with an ability to—as one of our new friends that we interviewed said—build these assets as ecologically invisible as possible. I think we have the opportunity to do that. And when we come out the other end having done that, I think our children's generation will look more kindly on us. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:04:04): I think so, yeah. My big takeaway is that, of all the things we might study on this show, this one feels like the major piece of infrastructure that we're living in the middle of the step change. We are in the sharp part of the curve that's going up. This level of capital investment and build-out is what it looked like if you were to put yourself back into the initial build-out of the electricity grid or the railroad system, but further compressed. What's so interesting about that is you get to experience personally how quickly you adapt to amazing infrastructure and power—how quickly we've adapted, I think, to having the latest large language models at our fingertips. Now I have Claude Code, and I'm a few weeks into using that. I have what feels like new powers, but I'm kind of getting used to it again. We lived through most of this story and have vivid memories. Like, I remember Blockbuster, and I remember when Netflix was a DVD rental service. That was because it was too expensive to move streaming video at that scale, and now it's blindingly cheap. The business model changes; the products completely change. We are living through this cycle of infrastructure iteration and evolution at a pace that's rapidly changing what we can do with it. I don't know when we'll again get to the upper step of that curve, but we are living in the step change, and I'm just trying to relish that experience. Anay Shah (04:05:35): The rocket ship is in takeoff, feeling some G-forces. That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:39): But you get used to it, don't you? Anay Shah (04:05:41): Very quickly. Shockingly fast. I mean, even since we launched the fund two years ago to now, our workflows have changed dramatically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:53): That's right. Anay Shah (04:05:54): Despite the fact that you and I continue to look at each other 12 hours a day in the same screen. Yeah, yeah. The normalization of humans is astounding. And then you start thinking about our kids and how they're growing up in... Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:06): This moment: speaking to ChatGPT, Santa Claus if they want, or making a game. My four-year-old programmed a game that runs in JavaScript by telling Claude what he wanted. Anay Shah (04:06:18): Amazing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:20): It is wild, wild times. Anay Shah (04:06:22): We are living through a step change moment. Thanks for listening. Hopefully you're that much more informed about the invisible infrastructure that's not so invisible in powering the modern world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:39): You know how you got this podcast into your ears? It's amazing. That's right.

Title: AI’s Next Dividend Bonanza Is NOT Where You Think
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/17/ais-next-dividend-bonanza-is-not-where-you-think/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. While Wall Street chases NVIDIA (NVDA), the real AI dividend story is unfolding in the sleepy insurance sector. These “boring” firms are quietly leveraging AI tools to slash costs, grow premiums, and—best of all—dish us bigger dividends. AI is spreading across the economy much faster than many expected. That means we need to move even faster to front-run that shift. We’ve already been hard at it. In July, we talked about our favorite dividend payer to grab as AI reworks farming. Few people realize it, but “ag” has a long history of leveraging tech. It’s a big reason why productivity per farm worker has shot up 16X since 1948. Then there’s small business—and our favorite 8.8%-paying business development company (BDC), which funds many of these “mom-and-pop” shops. You don’t hear much about it, but small biz is wildly optimistic as AI helps it solve one of its toughest challenges: finding skilled workers. So where to next? When most people think about AI in business, they think about annoying customer-service chatbots. But that’s just the public side, and only a small part of the story. The real AI “juice”—especially for insurers—is on the back end. Picture an AI app pulling data from a patient’s medical records, zipping through the underwriting process and delivering a quote in seconds. While that’s going on, another runs compliance checks. Claims? Send in a picture of your damaged car/house/business and your payout pops into your account in minutes. Absolute gold for customer retention. All of this is happening in insurance right now. And that’s just on the efficiency side. The growth story is where things get interesting, as salespeople use AI to zero in on leads and cross-sell products. One example, cited in a July 2025 report from research firm McKinsey & Co., is that an AI app could assess a new life-insurance customer and toss out a personalized package, including disability and critical-illness coverage. As I said, initiatives like these are driving real returns for insurers today. And according to a January 2024 report from McKinsey, insurers that prioritize tech, including AI, have delivered far bigger total shareholder returns (TSR) than firms in other sectors. The best part of all for us is that the public still sees insurers as stuffy pencil-pushers (the same type of outdated view that hovers over agriculture). Let’s dive into three insurers leading the way in AI, and likely to hand their savings (and profit growth) to us in the form of dividend hikes. They all have appeal, but to make things simple, I’ve ranked them from “worst to first.” Progressive (PGR) was already a leader in algo-driven insurance before AI came along. Through fictional salesperson “Flo,” it could deliver a competitive insurance quote for a car, home or even a boat in a few minutes. Fast-forward to today and Flo is, you guessed it, a chatbot. Looking a bit deeper, the company is using AI to further refine Snapshot—its program that adapts rates based on real-time data from a customer’s car. It’s also using the tech to analyze photos of damage to speed up claims. Members of my Hidden Yields service will remember this one: We bagged an 87% return on it during our last holding period, from June 2019 to May 2023. PGR remains on my watch list, and we won’t hesitate to jump back into this savvy dividend payer (whose 0.16% yield masks the fact that it pays most of its dividend as a year-end special payout—often a big one). But with the stock trading around 4.4-times book value, that time is not now. We’d also like to see more buybacks: PGR’s share count is about where it was 10 years ago. The Travelers Cos. (TRV) is a giant in insurance, offering everything from property to personal and business coverage. On the claims side, Travelers, like Progressive, uses AI to analyze images of property damage and speed payments to policyholders, often before a human ever sets foot on the site. That kind of speed gives TRV a much better shot at keeping customers happy—and hanging on to their business. On the growth side, the company has tools like Business Owner Policy 2.0, which speeds up underwriting, getting a quote into a new small business customer much faster than in “analog” days. According to the company, the process cuts the number of questions a potential new business client has to answer by 70%, from around 40 to roughly nine. Moves like these are rocket fuel for a business that’s already firing on all cylinders. In the second quarter, TRV saw its catastrophe losses drop from $1.5 billion a year ago to $927 million. Written premiums jumped 4% and net investment income jumped 6%. That last number is particularly impressive since an insurer’s “float”—made up of total premiums collected—has to be placed in safer investments. Management loves its shareholders, too: Over the last decade, Travelers bought back 26% of its shares and hiked its payout 80%. That’s driven the share price up a stout 170%. With reinvested dividends, that return jumps to 237%! The only drawback? We like to buy a stock when the share price lags its “Dividend Magnet”—a true sign of value—and that’s not the case here. That’s why we’re putting this “stealth” AI dividend play on our watch list, instead of our buy list. Meantime, the AI focus at American International Group (AIG) is solidly on underwriting. The company has teamed up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Anthropic to develop AI tools that supercharge its human underwriters. Through these deals, it aims to help its underwriters process 500,000 E&S submissions in 2030, generating at least $4 billion in new business premiums. (E&S covers risks that don’t fit neatly in the silos of other kinds of coverage.) To put that in context, AIG generates about $28 billion in revenue a year. AIG also plans to create a “digital twin,” kind of a virtual mock-up of itself management can use to see what various decisions could have on the business. It’s on the dividend front that AIG gets really interesting. It yields 2.3% today and, following a long, stale period stretching back to 2016, it has recently sprung back to life. Management hasn’t been leaving investors out in the cold, though—it’s been busy buying back its ultra-cheap stock. That includes a massive repurchase of 56% of its shares outstanding in the last decade. Better still, it’s been accelerating those payouts just as it’s reawakened its dividend: Normally we don’t like to see a company buy more of its stock as it’s rising, as is the case here. But AIG’s reasonable valuation of around book value is backed up by its share price, which still lags the dividend. An AI-powered efficiency boost would only add to the stock’s momentum.

Title: China Bans Top Tech Firms From Buying Nvidia Chips, Report Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/china-bans-top-tech-firms-from-buying-nvidia-chips-report-says-11811683
Time Published: 2025-09-17T15:13:01Z

China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country. Shares of Nvidia, which entered Wednesday's session up roughly a third this year, fell about 3% in recent trading following the news. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D—the chip Nvidia introduced in July for the Chinese market, according to the Financial Times. Beijing had concluded that homegrown chips are now performing on par with the Nvidia chips allowed in China under export controls, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. The FT report said the companies that started testing and verification work on the chip with Nvidia's server suppliers have since told their suppliers to stop the work. The new ban is stronger than prior guidance from regulators that focused on curbing use of the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip, and comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Asked at a press conference in London about the reported ban, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was "disappointed." Huang is among U.S. tech executives accompanying President Donald Trump on a state visit to the U.K. "We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said, according to a transcript provided to Investopedia by the company. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese [government] and Chinese companies as they wish.” Nvidia faces U.S. export restrictions on sales of its most advanced chips to China and has tailor-made some of its semiconductors for the country's market. In August, Trump ended H20 restrictions his administration had placed earlier earlier in the year in exchange for a 15% share of revenues.

Title: Today in Apple history: Apple stock smashes through $700 barrier

Time Published: 2025-09-17T14:48:43Z

By Luke Dormehl • 7:48 am, September 17, 2025 September 17, 2012: On the back of record iPhone 5 preorders of 2 million in 24 hours, Apple’s stock price hits a new all-time high. For the first time in history, AAPL breaks the $700 mark in after-hours trading. Passing the milestone cements Cupertino’s place as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Amazingly, the new record is $270 a share higher than at the start of the year. Apple stock rose 65% in just nine months. By any measurable metric, Apple enjoyed soaring success in 2012. A stock price breaking $700 was just the latest in a series of dizzying records the company set in a few short years. In January 2006, Apple surpassed the value of Dell, the company whose founder once said he’d shut down Apple and refund its shareholders. A few years later, Apple overtook Microsoft — besting the tech giant that dominated the 1990s. In August 2011, Apple briefly overtook ExxonMobil to become the world’s most valuable company. And Apple’s stock price just kept climbing from there. At the end of February 2012, Apple surpassed the $500 billion market cap, then smashed through $600 billion in April. By September 2012, Apple was valued at upward of $650 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple was worth more than second-place ExxonMobil plus the entire net worth of Google at the time. Not bad for a company that had fallen to $12.88 a share on September 29, 2000. Apple hasn’t exactly renounced its winning ways since then. It became the first publicly traded U.S. company to pass the $800 billion, $900 billion, $1 trillion, $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion valuations. In early 2022, it surged past the $3 trillion line briefly before dropping amid a wider market pull-back. And it did the same thing in mid-2023. (Phew!) At the time of writing, AAPL is trading at around $240 a share. However, it’s not fair to compare this stock price with Apple’s $700 milestone from 2012, due to a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014 and a subsequent 4-to-1 split in 2020. As the stock prices of some AI-focused companies surged in recent years, Nvidia and Microsoft surpassed Apple’s market valuation. Currently, Apple’s market cap sits at $3.554 trillion, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world, with Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Meta hot on its heels.

Title: Has Elon Musk really been awarded a $1 trillion pay deal?

And why has the South African entrepreneur been busy buying up shares in Tesla? By Alex Kozul-Wright Share Save Tesla shares jumped 6 percent on Monday after CEO Elon Musk disclosed that he had bought $1bn worth of the company’s stock. The move reinforces Musk’s push for greater control over Tesla and comes a week after the company’s board offered him a $1 trillion pay package over the next decade. Musk’s stock purchase – his first open-market buy-up of shares since 2020 – comes at a critical time for Tesla, as it races to transform into an artificial intelligence and robotics firm whilst also grappling with falling sales of electric vehicles (EVs). But Musk’s pay packet has come in for intense criticism. Last weekend, Pope Leo decried the widening pay gap between corporate bosses such as Elon Musk – whose estimated wealth now stands at $367bn – and ordinary working people, which he said was a major factor in growing global unrest. On September 12, Musk, 54, purchased 2.57 million shares (which represents less than one percent of Tesla’s market capitalisation), paying between $372 and $397 per share as the price varied through the day, according to regulatory filings. He now owns almost 20 percent of Tesla, which seemingly pleases its investors. Tesla’s share price rose to around $422 on Monday – still 12 percent lower than its all-time high of $479 (reached in December 2024). Following his recent move, Musk posted on X that the increase in Tesla’s value was “foretold in the prophecy”. While Musk wasn’t an original founder of Tesla – he invested in the company one year after it was established – he became chairman in 2004. The South African entrepreneur has consistently demanded a bigger stake and more voting power at Tesla, having previously said he would prefer to build AI products and robots outside of Tesla if he cannot control 25 percent voting power in the firm. Musk sold more than $20bn of Tesla’s stock (or 4.6 percent of its market cap) in 2022 to fund his acquisition of Twitter, now X, for $44bn. He also owns private holdings in SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. The Tesla CEO will have to meet certain performance-related criteria first. To unlock the full $1 trillion payout, Musk will have to raise the company’s valuation from roughly $1 trillion today to $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years. He will also have to sell one million autonomous taxis and one million robots and increase Tesla’s profits by more than 24 times what it earned last year. Tesla currently operates a few dozen autonomous taxis in a limited area in the city where it is headquartered, Austin, Texas in the US. Known as “robotaxis“, they are self-driving vehicles but are accompanied by human “safety supervisors”, who can intervene if problems occur. On the robotics side, the company unveiled its first humanoid robot – Optimus – in 2022. In 2024, Musk claimed that Tesla would deploy robots for “internal use [ie for use inside its own factories]” in 2025, and that it would have produced 5,000 units by then. Neither pledge has been met so far. Musk also recently said that “80 percent of Tesla’s [future] value will be Optimus”. After Musk joined Tesla in 2004, he took very little cash pay. Instead, he chose to be paid in equity. Then, in 2018, shareholders approved a landmark 10-year pay package for Musk – linked to various operational targets – estimated at $2.6bn. As Tesla’s market value surged after the start of 2020 (when it was trading at just $29.50 a share), many of those pay objectives were met, and Musk received a large number of additional Tesla shares. Due to broad stock market gains since the COVID-19 pandemic, Musk’s earnings are estimated to have climbed by $40bn-$60bn. Though Musk’s pay windfall at Tesla has attracted regulatory scrutiny for overcompensation, especially from Delaware’s Court of Chancery, most of the company’s shareholders have repeatedly ratified the CEO’s payment packages. Tesla doesn’t disclose non-executive salaries, so it is hard to say how Musk’s income compares to that of the average worker there. However, corporate pay in the US has generally rallied in recent decades compared to that of workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, average pay for CEOs at S&P 500 companies – the 500 biggest listed firms in the US – rose by almost 1,000 percent over the 50-year period leading up to 2024. By contrast, a typical worker at an S&P 500 company has seen his or her pay packet rise by just 27 percent (adjusted for inflation) over the same period. Stated differently, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased from 30:1 to 350:1 over the past five decades. In an interview last week with Crux, a Catholic news website, Pope Leo singled out Elon Musk as an example of the kind of wealth he said was corroding “the value of human life, of the family, of the value of society”. Asked about Tesla’s proposed $1 trillion pay packet, Leo responded: “What does that mean, and what’s that about? If [personal wealth accumulation] is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.” Despite its recent uptick, so far this year, Tesla’s stock market performance has been among the worst of the “Magnificent 7” group of tech giants – which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia – having lost around 2 percent of its value this year so far. Tesla’s most recent quarterly results showed profit losses amid falling demand for electric vehicles and increased import production costs associated with US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Looking ahead, earnings look set to continue falling. Sales of Tesla cars in the US will likely fall further in the last three months of 2025, as Trump has refused to extend a tax credit for EV purchases for US consumers after October. Up to now, the rebate has played a crucial role in making American EVs more affordable. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Rocket Lab: How Low Can RKLB Stock Really Go?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) trended lower following the company's announcement to raise $750 million through equity dilution. This move, which increases the total number of shares, often concerns investors because it can negatively impact a company's earnings per share. The key question is the extent of the downside risk for RKLB stock. Despite its recent decline, the stock still appears overvalued. This overvaluation, combined with the stock’s history of only modest rebounds after previous drops, suggests there is considerable risk. Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for RKLB, see Buy or Sell RKLB Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it is crucial to determine if the situation deteriorates significantly, leading to an additional drop of 20-30% to the $33 level, and whether we will be able to retain the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Below is an in-depth analysis of Rocket Lab’s downturn resilience – particularly, its performance in comparison to the market during previous crises. It turns out that the stock experienced an impact that was slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) how swiftly it recovered. Below are the specifics, but before that, as a brief background: RKLB offers launch services, small orbital vehicles, and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government space and defense sectors. Overall, Rocket Lab (RKLB) stock has a history of experiencing significant declines during broader market corrections. While the company has generated investor interest through its successful rocket launches and new contracts—especially for its upcoming Neutron rocket—investors should also be mindful of the potential downside risk. Concerned that RKLB may decline further? You may want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have historically comfortably outperformed its benchmark, which comprises the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a steadier ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs on Blockchain in Push Beyond Treasuries: Report

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The world’s largest asset manager is exploring putting exchange-traded funds on chain, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

Job seekers: Where are you looking for opportunities right now? There’s been plenty of coverage on the plight of those currently looking for a new job. From the falling hiring rates and increasing unemployment time—the average American now spends more than five months in between jobs, up from four in 2024—to the flood of AI-generated résumés that recruiters receive, applicants are having a tough time. Keeping your search to just one job board isn’t cutting it anymore. Now, OpenAI is tapping into the game. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to launch its own jobs platform next year. The platform “will have knowledgeable, experienced candidates at every level, and opportunities for anyone looking to put their skills to use,” according to a blog post from CEO of Applications Fidji Simo. It will also help small businesses find “AI talent” for specific needs. The tech giant is also getting in on the certifications industry, which made $6.4 billion in revenue last year, according to IBIS world. OpenAI’s options will include certifications from intro-level all the way to advanced AI usage, such as prompt engineering. They’re not the first company to inject AI into the job search process. LinkedIn started incorporating the technology into users’ job searches in 2023. As of May, Premium users can ask LinkedIn’s AI to find personalized jobs through a chat. Companies like Coursera, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and even LinkedIn have long had their own “AI fluency” or “Intro to AI” certifications for workers looking for that extra badge. Still, for those struggling to land their next job, Forbes contributors have a few suggestions: For one, look at niche job boards, writes Bryan Robinson. It’s easy for people to spam LinkedIn postings with résumés and applications for jobs they’re not quite qualified for, causing some qualified candidates to get buried. By using lesser-known job boards like Wellfound, Otta or FlexJobs, your odds of getting a response could increase. And once you’ve scheduled an interview, you can use AI as your personal coach, suggests contributor Justin Sablich. Custom interview prompts, like using the STAR—situation, task, action, result—method or asking the model to act as an adversarial interviewer can help you go deeper with each question. But always be wary of the specific information you give the chatbot. Have any other tips on finding your perfect job in this new market, or questions over your own search? My inbox is always open.

Stanford holds the best MBA program this year, according to LinkedIn’s annual ranking of postgraduate programs. Cofounder, CEO and product manager are the most common titles to come out of the school. Real estate giant Brookfield declared the return-to-office debate “over” in its latest investor day presentation. The news comes as Microsoft employees will be required to be in the office three days a week starting in 2026. Though this caused an online stir, the slight increase from 2.5 days fell in line with the majority of Fortune 100 companies, according to FlexIndex. Lawyers representing powerful names like Sean Diddy Combs and Elon Musk are some of the Top Lawyers in America this year, according to Forbes’ annual roll call of the country’s high-caliber counsel. Unlike during his first term, President Donald Trump has not yet declared the start of Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 through October 15) as of Tuesday morning. Some celebrations have been slimmed down or even canceled this year amid fears over immigration raids and efforts to combat diversity, equity and inclusion.

Title: Waymo's robotaxi expansion will get a Lyft in Nashville next year

Robotaxi leader Waymo's driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber Robotaxi leader Waymo on Wednesday announced that its driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year while heading in a new direction by teaming up with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber. The Nashville plan calls for robotaxi ride requests to initially be limited to Waymo's own mobile app before expanding on to Lyft's app later next year. Waymo's decision to work with Lyft in Tennessee's biggest city means its robotaxis will now be available on the apps of the two largest ride-hailing services in the U.S. As part of earlier expansions, Waymo is already dispatching robotaxis through Uber's app i n Atlanta and Austin, Texas. Electric automaker Tesla has been testing a limited driverless service in Austin in an attempt to fulfill an ambitious plan that CEO Elon Musk has been pursuing for the past decade. Even if it's in only one city, getting Waymo's industry-leading robotaxis on its app could help Lyft continue its recovery from the pandemic restrictions that decimated demand for rides. Uber bounced back from the pandemic more quickly, a comeback that has been reflected in both its financial results and market value, which has tripled since the end of 2019. Lyft's stock price, in contrast, remains about 50% below where it stood at the end of 2019. As part of its turnaround efforts, Lyft hired former Amazon executive David Risher as its CEO two years ago. Risher previously negotiated a partnership with May Mobility that is now providing driverless rides in Atlanta in competition with Waymo and Uber. This is not the first time that Waymo and Lyft have worked together. During the testing phase of its robotaxi service in Phoenix in 2019, Waymo offered a limited number of rides through Lyft. That arrangement ended after Waymo completed the Phoenix tests and began accepting driverless rides from all interested passengers on its own app more than five years ago. Since starting in Arizona, Waymo's robotaxis have provided more than 250,000 trips in cities from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. Waymo, which began in 2009 as a secret project within Google, also plans to expand into Dallas next year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

For most of Big Tech, 2025 has been a solid year financially — Intel being the notable exception. But for employees, job security feels increasingly fragile. According to an analysis by RationalFX, a total of 166,387 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2025. The report pulls information from U.S. WARN notices, job board TrueUp, TechCrunch, and the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. Intel tops the list. The struggling chipmaker plans to cut around 34,000 jobs this year as it tries to streamline operations and reset its strategy. Microsoft isn’t far behind. The Redmond-based giant has already gone through multiple rounds of layoffs: roughly 6,000 roles in April and another 9,000 in July, RationalFX foresees a total of at least 19,215 positions in 2025 eliminated in the name of efficiency. India’s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ranks third, with an estimated 12,000 employees let go this year, largely as part of cost-cutting measures and the rollout of AI-driven automation. Cuts haven’t stopped there. Almost every major player has made reductions: IBM is phasing out about 9,000 HR roles, shifting many of those responsibilities to AI. STMicroelectronics, the European chipmaker, is cutting 5,000 jobs. Salesforce shed 1,000 positions in February and another 4,000 in September. Meta has already let go of 3,720 staff this year, continuing a pattern from previous years. Amazon eliminated over 3,350 jobs, including through the closure of all its Canadian warehouses. Oracle laid off 3,000 workers in just the past two months. Even Elon Musk’s xAI joined the trend, dismissing 500 employees who had worked on training its chatbot Grok. AI itself is emerging as a major factor. Analysts estimate that roughly 37,702 of the layoffs this year were directly tied to automation and the adoption of AI tools that replaced human tasks outright. Looking ahead, RationalFX forecasts that total tech layoffs could climb to 235,000 by the end of 2025. RationalFX

Stock futures are little changed as investors get ready for today’s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to lower rates for the first time this year; China has reportedly ordered firms to stop buying the latest Nvidia (NVDA) chip designed for that market; Meta Platforms (META) is expected to highlight its AI glasses at its developer event; and StubHub shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are little changed ahead of today’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit fresh all-time highs yesterday morning before finishing the day slightly lower, were down less than 0.1% this morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked lower to 4.01%, near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were down slightly at around $3,700 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin edged lower to $116,300. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates today, with the announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET today. While most investors believe the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, some are betting that a half-point cut is possible amid signs of weakness in the labor market. The Fed will also release its quarterly projections on the direction of the economy and interest rates. At 2:30 p.m. ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss the decision and speak on general economic conditions. Investors will be looking for signals that the Fed believes economic conditions warrant more rate cuts in the coming months. China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading. Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's "Hypernova" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday. StubHub has raised $800 million from its initial public offering after pricing the deal at the midpoint of a marketed range, as the online ticketing reseller succeeds in its third attempt at going public. StubHub sold 34 million shares for $23.50 each, which values the online ticket reseller at around $8.8 billion. The stock is expected to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “STUB”. The IPO comes after StubHub delayed its own listing plans earlier this year amid market turmoil following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. StubHub’s listing follows similar public offerings in recent weeks, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna’s IPO last week.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg wowed Meta skeptics this time last year. He's about to try to do it again.

Meta's vision of AI-powered glasses as the next must-have device is about to face a major test. CEO Mark Zuckerberg set the bar high at Meta Connect in 2024 with the not-for-mass-market technology in its Orion glasses. Now he has to take the next step in marketable wearables — and get consumers to shell out. Zuckerberg is expected to take the stage at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters for the company's annual Meta Connect conference to lay out his vision for Meta glasses, headsets, and the future of contextual AI. The stakes are high. Meta is spending billions on AI research and hardware while competitors like Apple, OpenAI, and Google are chasing the same market. Meta Connect is Zuckerberg's chance to prove the company's sprawling investments in wearables, software, and AI are converging into something consumers would potentially pay more for. Last year, Zuckerberg generated major buzz with a prototype of the Orion glasses, Meta's first true attempt at fully holographic AR. He also laid out a vision of wider adoption of AI glasses. Though still a developer-only product, Orion impressed early testers, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Reddit's Steve Huffman. The demo also earned positive reviews from Business Insider's own Peter Kafka, who said he would "buy them in a heartbeat." At the event, Zuckerberg also rolled out updates to existing products, such as transparent Ray-Ban Meta frames, new celebrity voices for Meta AI, and a budget-friendly Quest 3S headset at $299. Meta's stock rose more than 2% during Zuckerberg's keynote, and the Ray-Ban smart glasses also became a hit, with sales surpassing 2 million units by early 2025. In May, Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now has around 1 billion monthly active users across Meta's apps. Leaks and reports suggest Zuckerberg will use this year's keynote to shift focus from experimental prototypes to products that it hopes will be widely adopted. Orion is equipped with cutting-edge technology and costs $10,000 to produce per pair. Meta's test this year is whether it can release a stepping-stone product in terms of price point and capabilities, and whether Zuckerberg could convince consumers to pay more for a pair of glasses than the current Ray-Ban Meta model, which starts at $299. Here is what we might see: This year's Meta Connect event comes during an escalating talent war in Silicon Valley. Not including the billions that Reality Labs, the division behind AR/VR, has lost in 2025, Meta has been dangling multimillion-dollar compensation packages to lure AI researchers and hardware engineers, and it seems to be working. Earlier this year, the company launched Meta Superintelligence Labs under Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. To bring Wang on board, Meta invested $14.8 billion in the startup for a 49% non-voting stake. In July, Meta lured away a co-creator of ChatGPT from OpenAI and appointed him chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs. The company has also recruited three researchers behind OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — who had spent time at Google's DeepMind. With all this AI talent and new hardware, Meta needs to wow consumers and Wall Street again. Jump to

Title: Will Your Job Survive? Tech Layoffs in 2025 Already Top 166,000

Tech Layoffs in 2025 Already Top 166,000 Tech companies are facing another wave of massive layoffs, with over 166,000 jobs lost so far in 2025 and projections nearing 235,000. Industry giants like Intel and Microsoft lead the cuts, with AI increasingly replacing human roles in customer service and operations. When COVID-19 struck, many people lost their jobs. People stopped going out as much, and a number of businesses had to shut their doors for good. However, the tech space saw a boom. More people stayed home to work, which meant there was an increase in demand for digital products and services, leading to a hiring frenzy. This all came to a head once the pandemic passed. Now, it looks like layoffs at tech companies are happening again. According to a report from RationalFX, the tech companies are going through massive layoffs in 2025. The report claims that there have been about 166,000 layoffs globally in 2025 so far, and it is estimated to reach as many as 235,000 by the end of the year. This means on average, there are 645 jobs being lost a day since January 2025. The report also reveals which companies have been laying off the most workers. At the top of the list is Intel, with an estimated 33,900 layoffs. This doesn’t come as a surprise. Intel has been struggling as of late, no thanks in part to the rise of AI which has led to an increase in demand for chips from companies like NVIDIA. Intel has also been a bit slow on the mobile front, allowing TSMC and Qualcomm to dominate the scene. Plus, the controversies surrounding some of its CPUs in recent years haven’t done them any favors. Microsoft comes in second place at 19,215 layoffs. We’re also seeing around 9,000 layoffs at IBM, 5,000 at Salesforce, 3,720 at Meta, and 3,350 at Amazon. What’s worrying is that some of these layoffs might not necessarily have to do with companies performing badly. But rather, some of these companies have found that replacing human workers with AI might actually be better financially. The report revealed that companies such as Salesforce slashed its customer support workforce by about half. This is because AI agents were more than capable of doing those jobs. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, also went through similar layoffs, thanks (or no thanks) to AI. IBM’s layoffs are also in part due to AI, where the company is looking to cut costs and streamline its operations. It is true that AI has the potential to take some of our jobs. Things like customer service makes sense. If AI can answer simple questions that customers have quickly and efficiently, why hire a human that might get it wrong? It is worrying, but that seems to be the direction we’re heading towards. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Property prices rose in the 12 months to July this year, up 7.5pc compared to the same time a year ago, but the pace of increases has moderated. In the 12 months to the end of June, prices were up 7.9pc. The latest Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows the greatest slowdown was in Dublin. House prices in the capital were 6pc higher at the end of July than a year earlier, versus up 6.8pc in the 12 months to the end of June. The CSO Residential Property Price Index shows property prices outside Dublin were 8.7pc higher in July 2025 when compared with a year earlier, a slight decrease, from 8.8pc in the year to June 2025. Dublin city prices were up 7.7pc at the end of July. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which has some of the highest average prices anywhere, the pace of increase has moderated significantly, with a rise of 4.7pc in 12 months. However, double-digit price hikes are still being felt outside Dublin. House prices in the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) are up 10.9pc, and the Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) they rose 10.3pc. Both the South-East, which comprises Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) had an 8.1pc rise in house prices. 80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 17th Households paid an average price of €374,999 for a dwelling on the residential property market in the 12 months to July 2025, the CSO said. The region with the highest median price in the year to July was Dublin, with median prices of €490,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the average price was €675,000. The least expensive region within Dublin was Fingal at price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €451,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, the CSO said. The least expensive regions over the last 12 months were both Donegal and Leitrim, where the standard price paid for a dwelling was €195,000. In the year to July, the Eircode area with the highest price for household dwelling purchases was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin), with an average price of €795,000. The Eircode area with the least expensive median price within Dublin was D10 (Dublin 10), where the median price was €314,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was A98 (Bray, Wicklow), with a median price of €549,999. The least expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon), coming it at €150,000, the CSO said. The total value of dwelling purchases by households at market prices filed with Revenue was €2.1bn in July 2025, representing a 6.6pc increase compared with the €1.9bn worth of purchases in July 2024 and a 20.8pc increase compared with the €1.7bn worth of purchases in June 2025. “While the slight fall in the rate of annual house price growth will be welcomed by aspiring buyers, this is not unusual for the summer, often a quiet time for house sales,” said Trevor Grant, chairman of Irish Mortgage Advisors. “However, this easing could be short-lived and we could well see the rate of house price growth pick up for September and October, often busy months for house sales.” The price indices for new and existing dwellings are produced on a quarterly basis and at the national level only.

Title: Annual property price growth slips to 16-month low - CSO
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0917/1533940-cso-residential-property-prices/

Eleanor Burnhill Dublin City Council has said it is working with the Department of Housing, the Land Development Agency and Approved Housing Bodies to build as many homes as possible for first-time buyers and those on the housing waiting list. Assistant CEO for Housing at DCC Mick Mulhern said the council is "working to deliver as many homes as possible in the quickest time frame possible" and is now working across 100 different sites to deliver 12 thousand homes, which he said could take a number of years. He said of the 169 new homes launched today at Rathborne Crossing close to Ashtown station, DCC would take 86 of those. "There'll be social houses in one and two beds as part of this new development, which also includes a new creche and amenity space." It comes as residential property price growth slipped to a 16-month low of 7.5% in July, down from 7.9% in June, new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show. The CSO said that property prices in Dublin rose by 6% in July and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7% compared with the same month last year. Lord Mayor of Dublin Ray McAdam said there was a significant pipeline of development by Dublin City Council in terms of housing delivery taking place in the city at the present. "But obviously I fully acknowledge that we need to do more, and we are doing more." He said a decision would be taken before the end of this year in terms of reviewing who gets priority from the council's housing list. He said the Strategic Housing Policy Committee was looking at this. He acknowledged there were too many families and individuals experiencing homelessness and he said: "What we're working to do is to ensure that we ramp up supply, to ensure those, those families, have an opportunity to move in, into permanent accommodation." Reacting to the figures, the Minister for Housing James Browne said supply was key, but the Government was working to deliver as many homes as possible. "I'm very conscious that's a very significant increase. It is affecting affordability. "We need to get the apartments and the homes built. People need to be able to afford them, and that's why we're taking as many measures as we can. "But the key to getting house prices stabilised, and actually at an affordable price, is supply. That's why everything I've been doing for the first six months as Minister for Housing is making those key decisions, often difficult decisions, often decisions are being criticised, but they will actually deliver the supply that we need." In terms of numbers, he said there had never been a 50,000 target for delivery. "There won't be 50,000 this year, but it was never intended to be 50,000 homes this year. "What we want to see is an increase in the homes last year, and continue to build on the momentum that is there. In the last government we went from 19,000 homes to well over 30,000 homes actually in the lifetime of Housing For All, we actually exceeded the targets." 'Significant step change' - Browne Speaking today, Minister Browne said the government is starting from further behind this year in terms of delivering housing that would have been expected. He said he expected to see housing targets and delivery accelerate as the years go on but he would not be drawn on how many houses will be delivered by the end of this calendar year. "We accept there has to be a significant step change," he said. He said a little over 30,000 homes were delivered last year but the hope was that would have been higher. "That was a real disappointment and it does mean this year and in the near future we're probably starting from further behind what we would expect," he said. He said important decisions were being taken to accelerate delivery including making the country a national rent pressure zone, giving more security of tenure to tenants and what he hoped would be more certainty for international investors. "We need international finance to finance the construction sector in this country to deliver," he said. He said with the ebb and flow of construction, a few apartment blocks being completed in December, slipping into January could fundamentally change annual numbers. "I've never been in the business of forecasting but my business is to ensure we maximise every opportunity to deliver as many homes as possible." In terms of homelessness figures he said this was being looked at a granular level to look at the different reasons for it and trying to address those. Asked about a downturn in planning applications and comments from the Labour Party that he was seeking to blame local authorities for this, he said: "We've seen a 35% increase in building delivery in the second quarter. You're always going to have when you're dealing with something like building variations of commencements, planning, the delivery." He said he will keep an eye on looking at how more planning we can be accelerated working with the local authorities, ensuring they have the resources they need. "It also means having the land zoned that we need as well. "This is not about the blame game. This is about ensuring that we have the homes delivered where we need to build, the communities that everybody deserves," he said. Housing Activation office 'up and running' Minister Browne says the new Housing Activation Office will have a lead or a head, but will not have a housing 'tsar'. "All of the specialists from utility companies are now in place, and the specialists from the local authorities as well. "We are engaging with local authorities, writing out to them soon to identify the key areas. So that work is ongoing, and we will be identifying that lead. I don't give it any particular moniker, but it will have a lead, and we're making that final decision as to how exactly that would be implemented," he said. The CSO figures show that house prices in Dublin rose by 6.2% while apartment prices increased by 5.3%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Dublin City at 7.7% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 4.7%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.7% and apartment prices rose by 7.5%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) at 10.9%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) both saw increases of 8.1%. The median price of a home bought in the 12 months to July 2025 was €374,99, the CSO added. Today's figures show that the highest median price for a home in the 12 months to July was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €195,000 in both Donegal and Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area in July was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €795,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the lowest price of €150,000. Today's CSO figures also show that a total of 4,712 home purchases were filed with Revenue in July, a decrease of 0.2% when compared with the 4,723 purchases in July last year. The total value of transactions filed in July was €2.1 billion - made up of 3,567 existing homes with a value of €1.5 billion, and 1,145 new homes with a value of €550.7m. Today's figures mean that Dublin residential property prices are 6.8% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 23% higher than their May 2007 peak.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google's stock has been making headlines, surpassing the $3 trillion market cap milestone as investor confidence grows. But here’s the bigger takeaway: even after this rally, Google still trades at a notable discount compared to Big Tech peers like Amazon and Microsoft. This recent surge isn’t just market hype—it could mark the start of a 50% rally for GOOG stock as the market finally recognizes that Google deserves premium valuations and reconsiders its pricing. The narrative around Google and AI is shifting. Remember when there was widespread fear that AI would cannibalize Google Search? That fear is quickly fading. Google’s Gemini, especially its viral “nano banana” feature, has propelled the Gemini app to the #1 spot on Apple’s App Store in the U.S. This shows that AI can enhance Google’s core offerings instead of threatening them. The market is finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying all along: treating AI as an existential threat to Google was always an overreaction. Instead, AI is turning out to be a complementary force that strengthens Google’s ecosystem. While we’ll explore Google stock’s upside below, if you want growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, check out the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – Can Natera Stock Reach $500? Here’s where the numbers get interesting. Google has long been the overlooked Big Tech player in terms of valuation multiples, and the data paints a compelling picture: The fundamentals say yes. Consider these key metrics: Microsoft’s premium valuation is warranted, but Google’s numbers aren’t far behind. Much of Google’s discount came from regulatory overhang—but with that mostly resolved, the rerating case has never been stronger. The move from 22x to 28x earnings shows this rerating has already begun. For Google to command Amazon- and Microsoft-like multiples (35x+), investors must see these key developments: Given these risks, investors could consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 blend). This quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks offers a way to benefit from market upswings while cushioning downside risk, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Google’s path to a 50% stock price gain isn’t wishful thinking—it’s based on a valuation gap that’s increasingly hard to ignore. The company has all the right elements: dominant market position, improving AI story, regulatory clarity, and solid financials. The real question isn’t whether Google deserves a higher multiple, but how soon the market will acknowledge that it’s moved beyond the “search disruption” and antitrust concerns that kept its valuation muted. With AI proving to complement—not compete with—Google’s core business, we may be witnessing the early stages of a major rerating.

Title: Altcoin season’s here. These three drivers are seen to fuel the rally

About us Copy link Altcoin season has arrived. It kicked off earlier in September as 75% of the top 50 coins had performed better than Bitcoin over the past 90 days, according to Blockchain Center, the crypto data company. The list excludes stablecoins. The term altcoin season refers to a period when cryptocurrencies that aren’t Bitcoin outpace the biggest crypto when it comes to upside price action. The rotation from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies will accelerate from here thanks to booming corporate treasuries, cheaper capital and regulatory tailwinds, analysts say. Shane Molidor, founder of crypto investment bank and advisory firm Forgd, told DL News that the cyclical nature of Bitcoin and altcoin markets means investors “will likely rebalance incrementally, allocating capital to altcoins.” The comments come as Bitcoin has dominated this cycle with roaring record prices and hype on Wall Street. Investors have ploughed almost $10 billion into Bitcoin exchange-trading funds so far this year, according to SoSoValue. Those funds are run by the likes of investment behemoth BlackRock. Yet, the top crypto’s dominance has slumped by almost 6% over the past six months to take up 58% of the $4 trillion market, according to TradingView. At the same time, CoinMarketCap’s alt season index is at 71, up from just 44 last month, while Coinglass’ tracker reached 80 out of 100, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum. The data seemingly punctures hedge fund managers’ assumption that Bitcoin will dominate the market for some time yet. Here are the top three drivers behind the altcoin rally. The altcoin bullishness comes as the US Federal Reserve is set to slash interest rates on Wednesday. Investors see an interest rate cut as all but certain, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That will inject fresh liquidity into the global financial system. Lower borrowing costs incentivises investors to bet on risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, which tend to pump their prices. As risk appetite grows, “we are likely to see a drill-down approach, whereby the top-ranking layer 2 and ecosystem tokens by TVL, volume, and protocol revenue become prime candidates for [treasury] inclusion,” Molidor said. While most traders are betting that the US central bank will slash borrowing costs by 0.25%, there is a small chance that it goes even deeper with a 0.5% cut. A bigger cut may trigger “a significant rally in crypto since no one is truly expecting it,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV global, said in comments shared with DL News. Crypto treasury companies have emerged as leverage engines of this cycle, sucking in billions in institutional capital. By issuing debt and buying crypto, digital asset treasuries, or DATs, create a reflexive flywheel for price action, Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, said. Annabelle Huang, founder of execution layer Altius, told DL News that momentum behind altcoin treasuries “will likely continue for high quality altcoins with sustainable revenue, at least as long as the DATs themselves have a sound structure, and continue to have access to cheap funding.” Treasury firms are likely to pick tokens from battle-tested blockchains with sustainable tokenomics, an active ecosystem, and healthy user metrics, Huang argued But “momentum will fizzle quickly for firms that don’t meet these two requirements,” she added. The alts most likely to benefit from treasury firms seeking to capture extra upside are household-names like “Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Sui, along with their top performing ecosystem tokens,” Molidor said. Last week, crypto got its biggest endorsement yet from the US government. Paul Atkins, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declared that “crypto’s time has come” and vowed to end years of hostility from the oversight agency. The SEC’s Project Crypto initiative “will clarify that most crypto tokens are not securities, create a unified regulatory umbrella for trading, lending, and staking platforms,” dispelling years of controversy on altcoins. The agency is currently reviewing more than 90 exchange-traded products, including altcoin applications for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. The SEC’s decision deadline for several of those applications begins in mid-October, with analysts like Balchunas predicting high approval chances for major altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Some of those deadlines have been moved to mid-November. The SEC’s commitment to creating more crypto rules comes on the back of US President Donald Trump’s embrace of digital asset and him championing pro-industry policies. For a full-scale altcoin rally like in past cycles, both profit rotation and confidence are key, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. “Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively,” he said.

Title: Drama at the Fed has CEOs worrying about the health of its reputation

As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. I remember the days when a raised eyebrow from Ben Bernanke would spark hours of debate over the then Fed chair’s mindset about the state of the economy. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, bragged about learning to “mumble with great incoherence.” The model of the inscrutable U.S. central banker illustrated the power and prestige of the Fed, evoking a need to be flexible and deflect any market reaction to anticipated interest rate shifts that might not come to pass. Fast forward to today and, as one Fortune 500 CEO told me this week, “it’s a circus over there.” Later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce the central bank’s first interest rate cut since December. In discussions this week, I casually asked some leaders about what they thought the Fed might do. Their reaction was quite different from the days of yore. There was concern about the Fed’s ability to manage inflation and maintain a stable financial system. “They didn’t act fast enough on inflation under Biden and they’re not acting fast enough on a shift in the labor market under Trump,” observed one. This moment feels particularly fraught. There is, of course, the hope that a 0.25 percentage point cut might boost consumer confidence, corporate spending, homebuying, investing, hiring, and all the other good things that lower interest rates are meant to do. The challenge for leaders there, is that there are so many other variables creating volatility in those areas, from tariffs to technology. But recent drama at the Fed has made some leaders worry about the health and reputation of the institution itself. President Trump has threatened to fire Powell, unsuccessfully tried to oust Governor Lisa Cook on unproven allegations of fraud, and appointed White House advisor Stephen Miran (who Fortune profiled back in May) as a governor earlier this week while continuing to push the Fed to cut rates. If there is a rate cut, the President could claim victory, making “the credibility of the Fed further erode.” Most of the leaders I spoke to thought the best time to assess the impact of all this may not be today, but rather in the days and weeks ahead. One common belief that I certainly share in this climate: Bond yields, stock prices, hiring, borrowing, buying or any other metric may not move in a predictable pattern, no matter what the Fed decides to do. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump defamation lawsuit has “no merit,” NYT says The New York Times responded to Trump’s lawsuit against the paper by saying, “This lawsuit has no merit. It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.” The suit—which you can read here—claims the paper tried to influence the 2024 election by, among other things, publishing an article which said, “[i]t is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump.” Trump vowed to crack down on “The Radical Left Media”: “We are going to stop them at each and every level!!!” White House considering plan to label opponents as “terrorists” The Trump administration is considering a plan to designate non-profit organizations that oppose the president as terrorist organizations, a classification that would automatically revoke their tax-exempt status, the NYT reports. George Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation are two institutions under scrutiny. Firings continue for employees who comment on Charlie Kirk A number of high-profile figures have been fired for their comments following the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, and the list is rapidly growing across industries. The wave of terminations is causing employers to reconsider how much they want to regulate employees' opinions as instances of political violence accrue. Trump visits the U.K. with deals in hand President Trump is enjoying a rare second state visit to the U.K. today. He arrives bearing a coterie of deals, worth multiple billions according to CNBC, from companies including BlackRock, Alphabet, and Blackstone, in addition to a series of new energy partnerships that include nuclear power. TikTok ban deadline moved to December 16 Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration has extended the deadline for TikTok to reach a deal that would offload its U.S. operations from its Chinese parent. Potential buyers include a consortium including Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake Management. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to discuss the deal later this week. Under Armour CEO’s defense of micromanagement Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is unapologetic about supporting micromanagement, calling the leadership style “underrated” and insisting that “the right answer will save us a lot of time.” Plank said in a recent YouTube interview that he wants his relationships with employees to reflect the relationship between him and his young adult children, based on mutual accountability and “modeling the behavior that I expect from my teammates to live by.” Epstein contact book released The House Oversight Committee released a tranche of new documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case, including the late billionaire sex offender’s contact book.

Title: OpenAI is giving its nonprofit $100 billion. Critics aren't convinced.

Time Published: 2025-09-17T09:00:01Z

Critics aren't convinced by OpenAI's latest restructuring plan. OpenAI said last week it will hand its nonprofit over $100 billion in stock, or 20% of the company's latest $500 billion valuation. It's part of the artificial intelligence giant's plan to restructure itself — it is technically a nonprofit, not a startup — so it can raise billions more from investors. Dozens of civil society groups, which want to ensure the benefits of AI are spread in the public interest, say they're pressuring regulators to protect OpenAI's nonprofit mission. They argue the nonprofit isn't fully independent from OpenAI and that $100 billion might even be a lowball given the company's prior commitments. These critics' voices matter because they're driving the pressure on California and Delaware regulators to keep investigating OpenAI over its restructuring. OpenAI's ability to do so and thus secure billions in new funding hinges in part on the outcome of this probe. As OpenAI inches toward its new structure, it's also racing against the clock. Its complex structure has already prevented it from reaching many potential investors, and the funding it secured is conditioned on near-term structural changes, it said in a letter this May. OpenAI stood behind its nonprofit's independence in comments to Business Insider. It also said that its existing nonprofit will remain in control of its for-profit entity as part of any changes. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings is looking into the $100 billion giveaway as part of her investigation into OpenAI. "We look forward to examining the details of this agreement as part of our continued review of OpenAI's plans, in keeping with our ongoing responsibility to safeguard the interests of its public beneficiaries," she said in a statement to Business Insider. California's attorney general declined to comment as OpenAI is under an active investigation. Advocacy groups have called for regulators to keep OpenAI true to its charitable mission, with over 50 joining a coalition called EyesOnOpenAI. They say that OpenAI's nonprofit isn't truly independent from the company, especially since the board members who briefly ousted CEO Sam Altman in November 2023 were replaced. The nonprofit's $100 billion stake doesn't fix that fundamental problem, in their view. "This setup risks perpetuating the problematic dynamics we have seen, essentially putting the foxes in charge of the henhouse," said Judith Bell, chief impact officer of the San Francisco Foundation. Orson Aguilar, CEO of LatinoProsperity, a lead member of the EyesOnOpenAI coalition, agreed. "The major question is whether the nonprofit is truly independent, and OpenAI has not announced any new mechanism or guardrails to ensure the public of that," he said. OpenAI's nonprofit board has operated as a "rubber stamp" since November 2023, progressive advocacy group Public Citizen said in a Friday letter, flagging the presence of Altman and corporate figures like BlackRock senior managing director Adebayo Ogunlesi for appearing to further "a for-profit mission." To resolve this, EyesOnOpenAI called on regulators in June to transfer most of OpenAI's charitable assets to a new, independent nonprofit. OpenAI told Business Insider that its nonprofit board is made up of eight independent directors alongside Altman and fully focuses on the mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. A $100 billion stake would turn OpenAI into one of the largest charities in the world. Some say it may not be enough. OpenAI's nonprofit should be entitled to almost all of OpenAI's earnings, not just 20% of them, says Tyler Johnston, executive director of The Midas Project, another group keeping the pressure up on regulators. "OpenAI once said that if they are successful, the vast majority of the money they ever earn will go to the nonprofit. So now, only offering them 20% seems like a downgrade," he told Business Insider. OpenAI said in 2019 that "any excess returns" — past a capped return for investors — would go to its nonprofit to ensure the benefits of AGI are widely spread. In May, OpenAI scrapped its capped profit model due to the rise of many other "great AGI companies." "This is not the time to step off the gas," Johnston said. OpenAI subpoenaed The Midas Project and Johnston earlier this month, accusing the watchdog of being funded by billionaire Elon Musk, who challenged OpenAI's restructuring in a lawsuit. Johnston denies the claims and says it's part of OpenAI's campaign to silence critics. OpenAI told The San Francisco Standard it's seeking transparency. Correction: September 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misquoted Tyler Johnston. The story has been updated to clarify that he said that offering OpenAI's nonprofit 20% "seems like a downgrade." Jump to

Title: Loverdos, K.M.’s promise and the “ready Nikos,” the approaches within ND & Samaras, National Bank and Piraeus Bank for the Ethniki Asfalistiki, the City meeting

Time Published: 2025-09-17T07:04:17Z
Full Content:
Hello, I’ll start with yesterday’s main political news: Andreas Loverdos joining New Democracy (ND). Loverdos has always been a centrist, moderate, low-profile politician who, wherever he served as a PASOK minister, left behind good impressions and some tangible results — how much or how little is subjective. He was terribly persecuted by the gang of his political opponents as well as common fraudsters in the Novartis case, but was acquitted only a short while ago. Obviously, ND had been waiting for his final acquittal before taking him in, but I have this question (and maybe you share it too): why in today’s PASOK — which is struggling at 12–13% and has lost dozens, if not hundreds, of capable centrist figures to ND — was there no room for Loverdos? What pushed him away? Because honestly, I don’t see any major ideological differences between ND and PASOK. Was it that “ready-Nikos” (Androulakis) didn’t want him? Did Loverdos seem superfluous? I don’t know where he will run or what luck he’ll have (though we wish him well), but compared to many we see and hear in PASOK today, Loverdos is in a different class altogether as a politician. And here’s a bit of info: two weeks ago, K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) had discussed Loverdos’ entry into ND directly with him and had promised it would go forward as soon as his court case was closed — and so it happened. “Bloodbath” in the South Loverdos’ addition to ND’s ballot in the Southern Athens Constituency really shakes up the deck. That’s where six ministers are elected (Dendias, Theodorikakos, Kyranakis, Spanakis, Theocharis, Anna Karamanli), two MPs (Kallianos, Voultepsi), plus two newcomers elected in May 2023 (Gaitanis, Gelefstathis). Also rumored: Stavros Papastavrou, former MEP Stelios Kympouropoulos, and Nikos Romanos had already announced his candidacy. In short: chaos. Taking it easy with Samaras As we approach elections, and given that Mitsotakis holds the lead in the polls at around 30% — double that of PASOK — he will increasingly try careful approaches on several… thorny outstanding issues (how more delicately can I put it?). For example: Maximos Charakopoulos as group representative in Parliament, showing up at Evripidis Stylianidis’ book presentation, and the next day at Patelis’ book. I asked about Samaras and the source replied: “That issue with President Antonis is delicate, sensitive, and very personal. K.M. wants to handle it himself with great care.” Without any extra info, I think the Mitsotakis–Samaras relationship within ND will now be approached very differently — led personally by the PM. KYSEA–Belharra Today’s KYSEA meeting (11:00) will be interesting, with focus on the migrant flow toward Gavdos and Crete’s southern coast. Plevris says that in the last two months alone, there have already been 1,500 deportations and voluntary returns. Also on the agenda: the likely “green light” for procurement of the 4th Belharra frigate, with Greece exercising the option included in the contract. Let’s see if in tonight’s ANT1 interview, K.M. says anything more about it. Normalization with Eugenios After some stormy months with the Church of Crete, yesterday’s meeting between K.M., Archbishop Eugenios, and Governor Arnaoutakis marked a “thaw” and gradual normalization. However, what was emphasized inside the meeting — reportedly held in a good atmosphere — is that the government will not withdraw the amendment regarding the immovability of the Metropolitan of Kydonia and Apokoronas, particularly Amphilochios of Kissamos. On the other hand, K.M. is said to have encouraged Eugenios to move forward with the person of his choice and close this divisive matter. London, Kikilias, and the Greek shipowners of the City As part of “London International Shipping Week,” Minister of Shipping Vassilis Kikilias was in London. On this occasion, Greek Ambassador to the UK Giannis Tsaousis hosted a dinner at the embassy residence in his honor. Among the 50 guests were prominent Greek shipowners in the City. First and foremost, Haralambos Fafalios, president of the Greek Shipping Cooperation Committee (known simply as “the Committee”), which this year celebrated 90 years of strong presence and remains a steady pillar of institutional advocacy and strategic support for Greek shipping. Also present: Dr. Nikos Tsakos (third vice president), Diamantis Lemos, Nikolaos Empeirikos, and members of the Mavroleon, Tsavliris, and Kerdos families, among others. In his speech, Kikilias promised reforms to reduce bureaucracy in registering ships under the Greek flag and to make the registry more competitive. To 6+4 of Hatzidakis to investors At yesterday’s Athens International Investor Summit organized by the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations in collaboration with Blackrock, Vice President Hatzidakis (who had also taken the legislative initiative for the establishment of the Innovation and Infrastructure Fund with a “dowry” of 300 million), presented 6 comparative advantages of Greece to investors and 4 possible investment sectors. The 6 advantages are the high returns due to the investment gap, macroeconomic stability, the geoeconomic advantage (single European market and central position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa), the inflow of funds from the EU, the business-friendly government, political and institutional stability. As for the 4 sectors, beyond shipping, tourism, the food industry and pharmaceuticals, he mentioned energy, networks, defense and higher education. Let’s see the response. Countdown for National Bank – Negotiations with Piraeus Bank Let’s now move to other market matters starting with the National Bank, for which the column predicts it will play a leading role in banking developments in the second half of September. The column reports that intensive negotiations are currently underway between National Bank and Piraeus Bank to resolve their Gordian knot of bancassurance. The information is that there should be no doubt that the issue will be resolved and each bank will go its own way. Simultaneously with the agreement, National Bank is cutting the umbilical cord with National Insurance, as the always silent, never hasty and by nature cautious P. Mylonas is running a process for the acquisition of 20% of an insurance company with which it will work on bancassurance once it is freed from the ties of National Insurance and, by extension, Piraeus Bank. The column’s information is that the selection process of the insurance company that will be the new partner of NBG is advanced, and barring surprises the news will come before the end of the month. Five insurance companies are participating in the process, since the prize of exclusive cooperation with National Bank is coveted in the insurance market, especially after the reshuffling caused by the acquisition of Piraeus Bank. This also explains the participation of five insurance companies and is the reason for the confusion that arose among us journalists, with each one writing down a different company name — I suppose because each candidate company leaked the name of the competitor it feared. I stop here therefore and list the insurance companies taking part in the “marriage” process with National Bank, which are: Munich Re (ERGO), Alliance, NN, Interamerican and one more. The blitzkrieg deal of Credia Bank And if National Bank will take center stage in the coming days, Credia Bank is already in the spotlight today with its acquisition of HSBC Malta. There are two points of interest: The first is the price, since the market expected a price of 300 million and not 200 million. The second is the blitzkrieg deal achieved by Credia, as the Greek bank expressed interest in late July – early August stating that its offer would be valid for 15 days and that it wanted a direct and straightforward deal. On 15/8 the non-binding offer was submitted and on 16/9 the agreement was announced. Today the CEO of Credia Bank, E. Vrettou, speaks to analysts and will provide an official picture of the strengthening of ratios and figures. According to information, she will mention that the assets of the new bank will exceed 15 billion euros and – according to management’s estimate – the final recurring profitability of Credia Bank will be strengthened by approximately 90-100 million euros annually. The Czech’s investment in Box Now Emma Capital of Czech billionaire Jiri Smejc, known from its years-ago investment in OPAP, continues to maintain an investment presence in Greece and one of its investments, Box Now, seems to have paid off very quickly. The company, founded in 2021, has evolved into the largest player in the domestic smart locker market, attracting the attention of PCP, the investment arm of Olympia Group, which acquired a 12.5% stake in Box Now. Based on the published financial statements, the company’s turnover skyrocketed last year to 15.3 million euros from 2.9 million euros in 2023, a result of the rapid expansion of its smart locker network and the commercial agreements it secured. The investments being made affected the bottom line of the balance sheet, with losses at 5.8 million euros, reduced from the 8.6 million euros of the previous year. The investment for the development of Box Now so far exceeds 42 million euros and continues to expand throughout the country, with emphasis on island Greece. Emma Capital’s plan now also includes neighboring markets, and thus the until recently CEO of Box Now Greece, Dimitris Andriotis, has taken on duties as Group CEO for Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Croatia, with the goal of faster growth in these countries. The Chinese secretary coming to Greece, the Americans and Piraeus From the Chinese embassy came into the dark room the information that “according to Xinhua News Agency, Li Xi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, will make official friendship visits to Greece and Belarus from September 17 to 24, 2025. The visits will take place at the invitation of the New Democracy party of Greece and the Presidential Office of Belarus.” It will be interesting to see if the issue of the port of Piraeus will be discussed, which has been “targeted,” along with other Chinese-owned ports, by Washington, because it is located at a strategic point amid geopolitical turbulence. All the more so now, with tensions in Gaza at boiling point. COSCO has denied that its port units, which are on the U.S. blacklist, are related to the Chinese military, and insists its operations continue normally. The Greek side states it has no official information. Among the ports targeted by Washington are those in which China holds significant stakes, such as in Panama, but also in Europe – particularly in Greece and Spain – as well as ports on the U.S. West Coast and in parts of the Caribbean. There is concern at the Big Port. And the point is that when buffaloes fight, the frogs pay the price. Orgasm in Golden Visa issuances of commercial properties The plan is simple: We buy an old and abandoned commercial property (an old workshop, a small factory, a large retail store, etc.) in a neglected corner of Athens. We convert it into a residential property and thus obtain a Golden Visa without paying €800,000, since €250,000 is enough according to the law. The change of use from commercial or industrial property to residential constitutes a golden “way out” for those who wish to acquire a residence permit through the Golden Visa, with the only prerequisite being the completion of the conversion before the application. Information indicates that only in the first 7 months of 2025, only in Athens, a total of 17,254 Golden Visas were issued (+31.4% increase compared to 2024). This number concerns residence permits through real estate investment, with the greatest interest coming from citizens of Turkey, China and Israel. In July 2025 alone, 932 new Golden Visas were issued, marking the largest monthly increase of the last twelve months. The forgotten commercial properties of the capital come to life, their neighborhoods change appearance, the wider area comes to life. In August there was a slowdown due to summer holidays, but in September the surge continues. The green maneuvers of Greek shipowners I wrote in early September about the holistic green transition of shipping which the International Maritime Organization (IMO), led by Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, wants to achieve by 2028. The effort is disjointed, the targets are considered unattainable and the most important thing is that there are no alternative fuels with zero CO2 emissions in production! The whole thing is in the realm of absurdity. Those who will not use such fuels will pay a tax into a special fund per ship and per carbon emission. And the question is where the large amounts collected will be channeled. The issue was raised by Vassilis Kikilias in the meeting he had the day before yesterday with Arsenio at the IMO headquarters in London. He told him that the IMO Net-Zero Framework requires corrective adjustments, since the lack of green fuels requires more realistic timelines, fair treatment of transitional fuels – such as LNG – as well as smart use of the reward mechanism. But the game seems lost. In fact, leading the international resistance against the IMO is none other than Donald Trump. Let’s see what we will see this coming October when everything will be played at the highest level. Meanwhile, Greek shipowners, faced with this Gordian knot, chose a middle-ground solution which has an expiration date. What did they do and what are they doing? They install scrubbers on their ships, reducing greenhouse gas emissions through filtering, until they see where things are going. According to analysts, about 900–1,000 Greek-owned ships are equipped with scrubbers, representing about 22% of the total. The main dilemma for Greek shipowners is how to make use of the existing investments in scrubbers at a time when the market is shifting to LNG, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen and biofuels. In short, their lines got crossed. Stock Exchange: Out of strength Not for a single moment of yesterday’s stock market session was there buying interest to bring the General Index into positive territory. It started with Coca Cola HBC (-2.42% at €42) which from the beginning of the session was losing €1 from its price. Immediately after, the systemic banks followed. It is characteristic that since Monday, August 25, when the sideways downward movement of the General Index began, the 4 systemic banks have been losing ground, but the non-systemic ones are gaining what the others lose. Logically tomorrow, an upward reaction of the systemics is possible, since technical analysis dictates that the Banking Index should not stray from yesterday’s closing at 2,202 points. In any case, the Banking Index – even today – records gains of +71.29%, a fact that allows not only the securing of profits but also rotation within the sector. Yesterday’s transaction value exceeded €183 million with €27.22 million in blocks, while the General Index ended the session at 2,033.23 points, with daily losses of -1.18%. It is a period of wars and geopolitical concerns, with turmoil in the debt market and currency shifts. In Greece, on Friday the September derivatives for indices and shares expire and the restructuring of the FTSE Russell and Stoxx indices is completed. The same day, late Friday night, Moody’s will publish its verdict on Greek creditworthiness, without particular expectations for surprises. With an “Italian scent” the pressures on bank shares Bank shares were in the crosshairs of sellers on the Athens Stock Exchange, as they were swept along by the “wave” of liquidations that hit banks across Europe. The source of the problem was Italy, where the Meloni government plans to burden the domestic sector with €3 billion over two years. With losses of 2.4% responded Intesa Sanpaolo, Mediobanca followed at -2.2%, Unicredit fell by 1.4%, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena moved lower by 2.8%. Some of Europe’s big banks reacted with even stronger liquidations. In Germany, Deutsche Bank slipped 3.3% and Commerzbank sank 4.2%. In France, Societe Generale led the losses at 3.7%, while BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole reacted more calmly with a decline of 1.7%. In Britain, Barclays fell 2.6%, Standard Chartered 2.3% and HSBC 1.2%. Spanish banks Banco Santander, Caixabank and Banco de Sabadell also lost more than 2%. Franchise agreements in Greek hotels All over Greece, old hotel units and complexes are signing franchise agreements with major foreign tourism groups, changing their appearance and offering a completely new product. International chains such as Hilton, Marriott, Accor, Wyndham and Radisson have already dynamically expanded their networks in the country. Already 50% of seasonal hotels have signed contracts for 2025 while 34% of them follow the commitment franchise model, committing 56% of their rooms at prices 8% higher compared to 2024. The new franchise deals concern acquisitions and upgrades of five-star units, such as the Golden Milos Beach in Milos by Domotel, or Radisson which is investing strongly in emerging destinations such as Mani. With these agreements, the quality of services and the equipment of the hotels are upgraded, while new tourist destinations are highlighted (e.g. Mani, Karpathos, Argolis). Franchise is evolving into a key driver of restructuring of our hotel market, upgrading the product and reducing the risk of overconcentration in Athens and the islands. In the age of over-optimism The latest available data show that 45.4% of American households have invested their savings in stocks. Even in the era of the big Dot.com “bubble” in 2000, the corresponding percentage was 38%. At a time when the S&P 500 Index is soaring to record levels, housing prices are at record levels, gold has broken every previous record, bitcoin is at unprecedented levels, American households are basing their prosperity on the expectation of continuous price increases. The “AI Euphoria” of recent years has outperformed the Telecom Bubble, even the Railway Mania of the 19th century. The latest Bank of America survey of fund managers (FMS) showed that the overwhelming majority of them believe that stock markets are overvalued. Yet they continue to invest, following the old saying of Chuck Prince of Citigroup: “as long as the music is playing, you have to dance.” …and suddenly Goldman Sachs “sees” gold at 5,000 dollars Goldman Sachs’ main estimate is that gold will reach 3,700 dollars by the end of the year. Suddenly, however, it put forward the forecast that gold could soar up to $5,000/ounce if the credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve is shaken. Even if a small percentage (just 1%) of the private U.S. Treasury market shifts toward gold due to uncertainty, these flows are enough to drive the precious metal’s prices to unprecedented heights. Goldman Sachs estimates the total value of privately held Treasury market portfolios at about 57 trillion dollars. Therefore, such a shift by private investors toward the safe haven equates to an additional $570 billion in demand in the gold sector. In practice, the gold market is much smaller in size, so “overshooting” is quite likely. The political questioning of the Fed by President Trump and concerns over the independence of monetary policy constitute déjà vu for investors who historically turn to gold when they fear dollar devaluation or accelerating inflation. Many central banks are expected to increase gold purchases, preparing for possible monetary shocks. Explore related questions

Title: UK, US agree £31 billion tech pact to mark Trump's visit

Britain and the US have agreed a technology pact to boost ties in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy, with top US firms led by Microsoft pledging £31 billion ($42 billion) in UK investments. The "Tech Prosperity Deal" is part of US President Donald Trump's second state visit to Britain, which will include a day of pomp at Windsor Castle today, hosted by King Charles and the royal family. Britain said the pact included joint efforts to develop AI models for healthcare, expand quantum computing capabilities and streamline civil nuclear projects. It added that it would support economic growth, scientific research and energy security in both countries. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal had the potential to shape the future of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and deliver growth and security. The US is Britain's single largest country trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their UK operations. Starmer, under pressure to reverse years of weak economic growth, now wants to pitch Britain as a destination for further investment by opting for the light touch regulation favoured by the US in areas such as AI, as opposed to the more interventionist approach of the European Union. The Trump administration has criticised European online safety laws and digital taxes, including those in Britain, but they were not part of the discussions over the pact. Under the deals announced, chipmaker Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 graphics processing units across Britain - its largest rollout in Europe to date. It is working to deploy up to 60,000 Grace Blackwell Ultra chips with UK-based Nscale, which will partner OpenAI in a UK leg of the US company's giant Stargate project and tie-up with Microsoft to establish Britain's largest AI supercomputer. Microsoft said it would invest £22 billion in total to expand cloud and AI infrastructure as well as in the supercomputer, which will be in Loughton, north-east London. Satya Nadella, chair and CEO of Microsoft, said it wanted to ensure that America remained a trusted and reliable tech partner for Britain. Its president, Brad Smith, said relations had improved hugely since the "dark days" before the UK's antitrust regulator dropped its opposition to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, saying he felt "enormously better". David Hogan, vice president for enterprise at Nvidia, told reporters the investments would "truly make the UK an AI maker, not an AI taker". Google announced a £5 billion investment, including a new data centre in Waltham Cross, north of London, and continued support for AI research through its DeepMind project. Cloud computing firm CoreWeave said its £1.5 billion backing would fund energy-efficient data centres in partnership with Scottish firm DataVita, bringing its total UK investment to £2.5 billion. Other firms announcing commitments include Salesforce, Scale AI, BlackRock, Oracle, Amazon Web Services and AI Pathfinder, with investments ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion pounds.

‘Tis the season. Everyone is gearing up for that time of year — holiday shopping. Is your businesses’ search engine optimization (SEO) strategy ready for the holidays? If you just broke out into a cold sweat thinking about it, don’t worry — we’re here to help. We’ll explore tips, strategies, and budget-friendly tricks to make sure your business is found this holiday season (and beyond) — and how you can use your customer relationship management (CRM) tools to turn your top searchers into your top customers. What you’ll learn: AI search, including Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot answers, and other LLM-powered engines, increasingly shapes how shoppers discover products during the holidays. A holiday AI SEO marketing strategy is a tactic to help small businesses appear in search engines and get seen for the holiday season — any season, really. Good SEO means making sure your digital presence is fully optimized, from your web copy to your store’s product descriptions to your opening hours, no matter what season it is. Let’s dig into why this is important. Effective SEO increases your brand’s visibility, driving more qualified leads to your website. These leads can then be captured and managed within your CRM system. In the reverse, content optimized for SEO can provide valuable information for your sales and marketing teams, enriching the data within your CRM. Also, by optimizing your website with the latest in AI-enabled SEO, you can personalize their experience and tailor your CRM efforts to nurture them more effectively. The future of SEO is AI-powered, and small businesses can get in on it too. The holidays are one of the few times of year when being small is an advantage. Surveys show 93% of U.S. consumers plan to “shop small” during the holiday season, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that eight in ten small businesses say Q4 is critical for annual profit. Modern LLMs are trained to detect and surface businesses that align with high-intent queries like “local gifts near me,” “independent bookstores with fast shipping,” or “family-owned bakery Christmas pies.” To be recognized, SMBs need to make these signals explicit. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM allows you to segment your customer base and understand their past purchases and preferences. This means you can create highly targeted promotions, gift guides, and website copy that resonate with specific customer groups, increasing the likelihood they’ll click through from search or answer engine results. No matter where you are on your journey as a small business, you can get started with Starter Suite — the all-in-one CRM for SMBs. Customer reviews are vital, but they’re not the only trust signal that matters in AI search. Answer engines cross-reference multiple sources before including a business in an answer. Local press mentions, chamber of commerce directories, event sponsorships, and nonprofit partnerships are all citations that machines can parse and validate. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help manage these efforts by centralizing contact information, tracking outreach, segmenting customer data, automating reminders for updates, and managing event planning. By proactively managing these diverse trust signals, businesses can improve their visibility and credibility in AI search.. Shoppers are no longer just typing. The proliferation of voice assistants and visual search tools means your business must be discoverable beyond traditional text queries. In fact, Google Lens reports billions of monthly image searches alone, so SMBs should think beyond text. Get your website voice-ready: Make your images findable: Multimodal AI discovery isn’t hypothetical; it’s happening now. A shopper might snap a photo of a candle on TikTok and ask, “Where can I buy this locally?” in search, and land on your store if your assets are properly tagged. How a CRM can help: By organizing customer data and preferences, a CRM enables businesses to create more targeted and relevant content that can be surfaced through voice and visual searches. Also, CRM data can help businesses keep branding and product information consistent across their online presence. Large retailers publish long holiday gift guides on their sites, but SMBs can win by publishing specific guides focused on certain topics or personas. In an AI-first world, specificity wins. AI overviews often surface micro-content that maps tightly to niche intents: “teacher gifts under $25,” “last-minute local pickup in Brooklyn,” “eco-friendly hostess gifts.” These focused guides often map directly to LLM-driven answer boxes, which pull concise, niche content to satisfy specific shopping intents. For SMBs, creating multiple focused guides is both achievable and impactful. Instead of pouring effort into a 2,000-word omnibus guide, launch three to five smaller landing pages: Each page should feature short answer capsules, such as: “Hand-poured soy candle, $22, available for same-day pickup. Perfect for teacher gifts – eco-friendly and long-lasting.” These capsules can be lifted directly into AI summaries, while the pages themselves capture long-tail traffic. Cross-link guides to relevant product pages and vice versa, ensuring both human shoppers and AI systems see the connections. How a CRM can help: By segmenting customer data, a CRM enables businesses to identify niche intents and create relevant guides that capture long-tail traffic. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses cross-link guides to relevant product pages. Learn how autonomous AI can scale your small business for efficient growth in our free e-book. Google’s guidance emphasizes E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. This humanization isn’t just about trust; it’s a critical differentiator. SMBs have an edge here. While big-box retailers rely on mass-produced descriptions, you can signal authenticity with small touches. What works: Research shows consumers increasingly value authenticity: 88% say they’re more likely to buy again after a great service experience, according to the latest State of the Connected Customer report. AI raters are trained to look for this, too — pages that show lived experience (“we tested,” “our team recommends”) are more likely to surface than generic, stock copy. How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses demonstrate E-E-A-T and authenticity by managing customer interactions and data that inform personalized content, such as customer testimonials, product recommendations, and staff-curated content. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses track customer interactions and feedback, allowing them to refine their content and improve overall customer experience. AI engines don’t just crawl websites; they also increasingly draw from community conversations on social media. Mentions in Reddit threads, TikTok videos, or Quora answers can seed authority signals that flow back into AI-curated summaries, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. For example, shoppers often post on Reddit boards like r/Gifts or r/BuyItForLife asking for holiday ideas. If a satisfied customer mentions your handmade product there, it becomes part of the training data that models like Perplexity or ChatGPT may cite. Similarly, TikTok’s algorithm surfaces local businesses for trending holiday gift tags, and AI scrapes those public posts. Practical plays: AI engines are trained to identify consensus, along with other things. A handful of high-signal mentions in the right community can outweigh dozens of low-quality backlinks. For SMBs, that’s a winnable path to visibility. How a CRM can help: A CRM can track customer mentions, reviews, and feedback, helping businesses to identify opportunities to encourage happy customers to share their experiences and showcase their products in community forums. By integrating social media data, a CRM can also help businesses monitor their authority signals and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. Cross-platform visibility means your business information is identical, and present, across the digital platforms that AI reconciles: your site, Google Business Profile (GBP), marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, Walmart), and social shops. AI systems (and people) mistrust mismatches, and guidance from Google stresses consistent, helpful, non-commodity content. Parity checklist (check weekly during peak holiday times): Why it matters: AI will show fewer options. Brands with coherent facts across touchpoints are safer to include. How a CRM can help: A CRM centralizes your customer and product data, ensuring consistency across your website, Google Business Profile, marketplaces, and social media platforms. By managing this data in one place, businesses can easily update product information, pricing, and other details across multiple channels, reducing the risk of mismatches and inconsistencies. Set up your digital storefront, engage customers, and sell more using a commerce-ready platform with integrated tools for every sale. Google’s holiday research highlights how spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions drive decisions; four in five smartphone holiday shoppers use their phone in spare moments, and those micro-moments add up. Here’s how to make sure your SMB site is set up for these micro-moments. 90-second purchase checklist: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses capture shoppers on the go by managing detail-heavy customer interactions and data that inform targeted marketing efforts, such as SMS reminders and instant promotions. Small Business Saturday, taking place every fall, is a moment to compound visibility: spikes in local search, social shares, and reviews build authority that carries into December. The SBA cites long-running consumer participation and cumulative spend; Constant Contact found one-third of annual revenue can hinge on the holiday season for many SMBs. Here’s how you can get it on the Small Business Saturday traffic in the week leading up to November 5: How a CRM can help: With a CRM, you can automate and personalize your marketing efforts, such as sending targeted emails and SMS messages, and track customer behavior and preferences for future marketing strategies. Additionally, a CRM can help you manage your business’s online presence by storing customer data, preferences, and interactions in one place, making it easier to execute any Small Business Saturday marketing plans. The biggest SMB constraint isn’t strategy; it’s time. That’s why automation should be targeted at the areas where consistency matters most to AI: feeds, inventory, and customer communication. Automation frees you to focus on building trust (content, reviews, partnerships). For many SMBs, platforms like Salesforce Starter Suite and Pro Suite make this achievable – unifying storefront, CRM, and simple marketing automation in one place. Automation priorities: How a CRM can help: By unifying storefront, CRM, and marketing automation in one place, a CRM enables businesses to refresh product feeds multiple times a day, automate “out of stock” updates, and schedule timely reminders for shipping cutoffs. By taking this busy work off your plate, a CRM lets you focus on the bigger picture. Learn how your business can benefit from this out-of-the-box CRM. Salesforce for Small Business Holidays don’t just test large retailers; they reveal how small businesses can carve out visibility in AI-powered shopping flows. For SMBs, the differentiator is agility: being clear, consistent, and credible across local and digital touchpoints. A CRM system plays a crucial role in this agility by unifying customer data, product information, and marketing efforts in one place. Small businesses that invest in structured data, authentic content, and cross-platform consistency—made easier through a CRM—will get their products surfaced in AI-curated answers at the very moment shoppers are ready to buy. And by using a CRM, SMBs can ensure that their customer interactions, product feeds, and marketing communications are consistent and accurate across all platforms, which is critical for AI visibility.

AI supported the writers and editors who created this article. How does AI search change holiday marketing for small businesses? AI search emphasizes structured data, local relevance, and authentic content, shifting focus from traditional keyword stuffing to providing clear, consistent, and human-centric information that AI can easily understand and surface. What is “E-E-A-T” and why is it important for small businesses in AI search? E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. For small businesses, it’s crucial because AI values authentic, lived experience and signals of trustworthiness. Highlighting founder stories, staff picks, and behind-the-scenes content can demonstrate E-E-A-T and improve AI visibility. How can small businesses improve social media to improve their AI search visibility? AI engines increasingly draw information from community conversations on social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit. Encouraging customers to post authentic content and engaging in niche forums can create strong authority signals that AI models may cite, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. What are “micro-moments” in holiday shopping, and how can SMBs optimize for them? Micro-moments refer to brief, spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions where shoppers make quick decisions. SMBs can optimize by ensuring fast website loading speeds, offering quick payment options like guest checkout, providing “buy online, pick up in store” (BOPIS) capabilities, and offering instant gift cards or SMS reminders for shipping or availability cutoffs. What role does a CRM system play in a small business’ holiday AI marketing strategy? A CRM system centralizes customer data, product information, and marketing efforts, ensuring consistency across all digital touchpoints. This allows businesses to automate tasks like inventory updates and personalized communications, freeing up time and ensuring data accuracy, which is critical for AI visibility.

Title: Jio BlackRock Sees India Mutual Fund Industry Tripling By 2032
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/jio-blackrock-sees-india-mutual-fund-industry-tripling-by-2032
Time Published: 2025-09-17T00:59:45Z
Full Content:
BlackRock Inc.’s India venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group expects the nearly $900 billion local mutual fund industry to expand up to threefold over the next seven years, fueled by record inflows from domestic investors and a robust economy. Participation in Indian financial markets is starting to increase rapidly, much of that driven by digital platforms, according to Sid Swaminathan, chief executive officer of Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal alliance between Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. and the world’s largest asset manager. Asia’s richest man is seeking to reshape India’s financial services industry by leveraging his vast telecom and retail empire. For BlackRock, the tie-up marks a return to money management in the world’s fastest-growing major economy after its exit in 2018. The move coincides with a shift in household savings — once tied-up in gold and property — toward financial markets. The change has fueled an explosive growth in the domestic mutual fund sector, with assets more than doubling over the past five years. “Being in India at this point in its economic journey, there are so many tailwinds in our favor,” Swaminathan, who joined the venture after a 20-year stint with BlackRock in London, told Bloomberg News in an interview. India’s equity markets have more than doubled to $5.3 trillion over the last five years, drawing millions of retail investors. But Jio BlackRock faces stiff competition from entrenched fund houses backed by major lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India, which command big distribution networks that reach small towns and villages. Online investment platforms such as Groww and Zerodha are also fueling the boom in direct mutual fund sales. Investor appetite, however, has been strong. The Jio BlackRock venture raised more than $2 billion in just three days for its debut funds in July, placing the alliance among the top 15 managers in that category. “For us to be operating in the next five years as a player of scale, it has to be about growing the market, rather than just capture market share from existing players,” Swaminathan said. That aim is shaping the asset manager’s approach: It is preparing a mix of passive and active strategies, with its first active equity fund set to launch next week. The product will draw on nearly 400 indicators on about 1,000 Indian stocks, building a portfolio broader than is typical for the category. In addition, it plans to launch a fund that rotates between sectors based on quantitative signals and is considering another one that systematically allocates between asset classes, Swaminathan said. The partnership hired Rishi Kohli, who headed hedge fund quantitative strategies at InCred Capital and Avendus, as its chief investment officer. The room for growth in systematic strategies is large in India, given the low starting point, Swaminathan said, describing the data-driven approach that also incorporates human judgment. As the market matures with more stocks and greater industry diversity, it becomes more conducive to such strategies, he said. The venture plans to use alternative data, from web-search activity to retail sentiment on online forums, and evaluate auditor quality when ranking firms. The Jio BlackRock partnership, spanning asset management, wealth management and equity broking, is pursuing a direct-to-consumer strategy via its app, bypassing traditional brokers and distributors. A sharp market decline could slow the sector’s expansion. Indian equities have significantly underperformed emerging-market peers in the past year, partly due to weak earnings growth and stretched valuations. Yet retail flows remain resilient, with monthly systematic investment plans topping $3 billion in August even as foreign funds retreated.

The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries. By Caolán Magee and PA Share Save United States President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, describing it as a “great honour” to be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The US president landed at the London Stansted airport on Tuesday evening, where new UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper was among those greeting him as he stepped off Air Force One. Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, is expected to stay overnight at Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park, before travelling to Windsor Castle on Wednesday for a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet. Thousands are expected to protest during his stay, though he has no public-facing engagements planned. Speaking to reporters before landing, Trump said: “My relationship is very good with the UK, and Charles, as you know, who’s now King, is my friend. It’s the first time this has ever happened where somebody was honoured twice. So, it’s a great honour.” The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries’ multi-trillion-dollar tech sectors. Trump is expected to be joined by a delegation of US executives, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Sky News reported that BlackRock plans to invest $700m in British data centres as part of a series of announcements tied to the state visit. The UK was the first country to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the Trump administration in May. Under that deal, Washington pledged to reduce tariffs on aluminium and steel from 25 percent to zero, though the changes have yet to take effect. Trump has hinted at possible tariff relief for UK steel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country residence, on Thursday. “I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit. We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them,” Trump said. Follow Al Jazeera English:

BlackRock is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country, which includes an initial investment of over £100 million in a data centre expansion west of London. The broader programme will enhance UK digital infrastructure. Founder and CEO of NVIDIA Jensen Huang said: Today marks a historic chapter in U.S. – United Kingdom technology collaboration. We are at the Big Bang of the AI era - and the United Kingdom stands in a Goldilocks position, where world-class talent, research and industry converge. By building state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and investing in British startups, we are unlocking the power of AI for the U.K. - fuelling breakthroughs, creating jobs, and igniting the next industrial revolution. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said: The UK has been a longstanding pioneer of AI, and is now home to world-class researchers, millions of ChatGPT users, and a government that quickly recognized the potential of this technology. Stargate UK builds on this foundation to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, improve productivity, and drive economic growth. This partnership reflects our shared vision that with the right infrastructure in place, AI can expand opportunity for people and businesses across the UK. Josh Payne, Nscale CEO said: We’re delighted to announce Nscale’s commitment to UK AI infrastructure today, including through Stargate UK and building the most powerful supercomputer in the country with Microsoft. As a UK-based company, we’re showing how we can be makers, not takers, of the most important technology of our time. Rene Haas, CEO of Arm: The launch of Stargate UK represents a critical step in expanding Britain’s AI computing power and digital infrastructure. As a company founded and headquartered in the UK, Arm is proud to be at the forefront of the nation’s semiconductor plans and to be a technology partner for Stargate UK, delivering the computing platform that makes scalable, energy-efficient AI possible. Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft: We’re committed to creating new opportunity for people and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, and to ensuring America remains a trusted and reliable tech partner for the United Kingdom. That is why we are doubling down on our investment in the UK, investing more than $30 billion over 4 years, including building the country’s largest supercomputer. This follows renewed commitments from US companies Oracle and Amazon Web Services in the UK. Oracle has committed to expanding the AI infrastructure it provides to the UK government reaffirming their $5 billion investment over the next 5 years. Whilst Amazon also earlier this year announced a commitment to build and operate data centres across the UK with an £8 billion investment. Showcasing how British technological excellence drives prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, UK-based quantum computing company Oxford Quantum Circuits installed New York City’s first quantum computer, in collaboration with NVIDIA and Digital Realty, and launched a pioneering Quantum-AI Data Centre just within the city. US quantum firm IonQ is setting up its EMEA headquarters and a new R&D and manufacturing hub in Oxford, following a $1 billion merger with UK start-up Oxford Ionics. The investment will create high-skilled jobs, boost UK quantum exports, and is a flagship example of US/UK collaboration in next-generation technologies. Michael Intrator, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CoreWeave: Our investment in the UK will establish one of the world’s largest concentrations of state-of-the-art, sustainable compute, unlocking new opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and scientific discovery. It allows us to deliver unparalleled AI performance with the lowest possible environmental impact, setting a new global standard. We look forward to collaborating with the UK government and the broader ecosystem to drive the next wave of responsible AI leadership around the world. Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce: We are doubling down on our long-standing commitment to the UK with this significant investment. We’re delighted that the UK, already a vital talent and innovation centre, will become our AI hub for Europe, driving product innovation for customers across the region. James Seppala, Chairman of Blackstone Europe, said: We are delighted that the government has designated our hyperscale data centre campus in Northumberland as an AI Growth Zone. This should help accelerate the development of one of Europe’s largest data centre facilities, with £10 billion of projected investment by Blackstone funds. We hope that the project will represent a transformational investment for the region, with the potential to deliver substantial benefits to the country and local communities, by driving innovation, creating high-skilled jobs, and solidifying the UK’s position as a global AI leader. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet and Google: With this new £5bn investment, Google is deepening our roots in the UK and supporting Great Britain’s AI development and application. Google’s investment in technical infrastructure, expanded energy capacity and job-ready AI skills will help ensure everyone across the whole of the UK stays at the cutting-edge of global tech opportunities. The UK and US governments will forge a historic research collaboration to advance the use of AI in drug discovery and other shared priorities like fusion energy. The UK and US will work together to drive AI-powered healthcare solutions in areas such as precision medicine and chronic disease – leveraging cutting-edge technologies and existing trusted and secure datasets, such as UK Biobank. The US and UK will also collaborate to co-create breakthrough research topics with the potential to catalyze investments that will redefine what is possible in medicine and patient care. The partnership will see AI models developed by NASA and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) to support science and exploration missions, like those on the moon and Mars. The deal will also create new opportunities for business and investment, as both countries look to scale up their AI infrastructure. This will be a boost to British businesses behind the infrastructure, like those creating the next generation of semiconductor chips that power AI all the way to those who operate data centres and other compute resources. The partnership will deepen the collaboration between the UK and US governments on advancing the science of AI security and promoting secure innovation – including by exchanging world-leading talent and expertise. By working together and alongside industry to develop standards we can promote the prosperity of consumers and the safety of our citizens, ensuring that the UK and US lead the world in understanding and harnessing advanced AI. In support of the US-UK science and technology partnership, Google DeepMind will work with both governments to advise on how scientists can harness the latest AI tools in their work - as well as continuing their partnership with the UK Atomic Energy Authority to advance fusion energy research in the US and UK. The UK and US will partner to develop revolutionary quantum computers and speed up the deployment of this technology across areas like healthcare, defence and finance. This will boost healthcare, protect citizens and create highly skilled jobs. For example, millions of patients could receive life-saving treatments faster thanks to this groundbreaking deal. Traditional drug discovery takes years and costs millions because it relies on simulating countless molecular interactions. Quantum computers can speed this up dramatically by simulating molecules more accurately and quickly than ever before. Quantum tech is already saving lives, including by helping to study and treat epilepsy and dementia or providing clearer insights into our brains for brain scans. This UK–US partnership could unlock even faster breakthroughs, bringing life-changing treatments to patients sooner and transforming the future of healthcare. Under the deal, the 2 countries will establish a taskforce of the UK and US’s top researchers to discover and accelerate breakthroughs in quantum technologies. An exchange programme across industry will also be created to spur adoption across defence, health, finance, and energy. Through the combined strength of national labs, the genius of British and American scientists, and the agility of leading companies, we can deliver unmatched innovation and keep our countries safe, prosperous, and leading the pack. The partnership will turbocharge the build-out of new nuclear power stations to secure jobs and growth in the UK and US. New deals between UK and US companies announced this week have been enabled by the partnership, which will make it quicker for companies to build new nuclear power stations by speeding up the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license. The partnership also extends to fusion energy, where British and American expertise will fast-track progress towards commercial fusion power. This golden age of nuclear is central to the government’s mission to build more clean homegrown power to ensure energy security.

September 16, 2025 17:14 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=167332&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you are a long-term stockholder in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against iRobot on July 7, 2025 with a Class Period from January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of iRobot have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you are a long-term stockholder of iRobot, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: SharpLink stock dips following latest buyback, Ethereum stash hits $3.8B

Funding another buyback push, SharpLink's Ethereum balance sheet swells to $3.86 billion, enticing long-term growth strategies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Shares of SharpLink Gaming fell slightly even as the Ethereum treasury firm pressed forward with its ambitious stock repurchase program, buying another 1 million shares. The company, which trades under the ticker SBET, said the latest purchases were executed at an average price of $16.67 each. Despite the move, SharpLink’s stock slipped 2.8% to $16.32 by late afternoon in New York. The buybacks are part of a $1.5 billion authorization approved in August. To date, the firm has retired nearly 1.93 million shares for about $32 million, funding the purchases with cash reserves, staking income, and other financing rather than debt. Alongside the buybacks, SharpLink continued to build its Ethereum balance sheet. The firm reported holding 838,152 ETH as of Sept. 16, up from 740,760 tokens a month earlier, with a total value of about $3.86 billion. The figure includes 3,240 ETH earned through staking since June. The company, backed by Ethereum developer Consensys, is the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion, which controls more than 2 million tokens. Together, the two firms account for the majority of Ethereum kept on the books by the roughly 70 public digital asset treasury companies that own at least 100 ETH each. SharpLink said it will only repurchase shares when its net asset value (NAV) falls below 1 — a level it considers a signal that the stock is undervalued compared with its crypto holdings. As of Sept. 15, SBET’s NAV stood at 0.91x, meaning the market was valuing its shares at about 9% below its ether reserves. Buybacks have become increasingly common among digital asset treasuries, though they remain controversial. Critics say they risk prioritizing short-term price support, while SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, argues the program is “immediately accretive” and strengthens long-term shareholder returns. SharpLink shares surged earlier this year after announcing a partnership with Consensys, briefly topping $78 in June, but have since pulled back. The company said it remains committed to aligning shareholder value with Ethereum’s growth, underscoring its strategy of using token accumulation and selective buybacks to “buy low and sell high.” AJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Title: Trump Postpones TikTok Ban Enforcement for Fourth Time as He Claims ‘We Have a Deal’ With China to Sell App’s U.S. Operations to ‘Very Big Companies’

Consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz would own 80% of TikTok U.S., WSJ reports By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok U.S. is poised to get a new ownership structure — and a new app for American users — if the Trump administration’s much-delayed efforts to ink a deal to comply with a federal law banning Chinese control of the app go through. President Donald Trump, speaking with reporters Tuesday outside the White House, said, “We’ve got a deal on TikTok. I’ve reached a deal with China.” He said there are “very big companies that want to buy it.” Trump said he is going to speak with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday “to confirm everything.” Related Stories 'Mamma Mia' Returns to Broadway: Here's How to Buy Tickets to the Revival Online 'Let the Good Times Roll,' Musical About New Orleans History and Culture, Eyes Broadway Bow (EXCLUSIVE) Since the deal isn’t final yet, Trump is again postponing his administration’s enforcement of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill — the fourth time he’s done so — pushing the deadline out 90 days, from Sept. 17 to Dec. 16. Popular on Variety Trump did not provide details on TikTok U.S.’s potential new owners. According to a Wall Street Journal report, TikTok’s U.S. business would be 80% owned and controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. In addition, current ByteDance investors including Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic, would be part of the 80% ownership group. Chinese shareholders including ByteDance would own the remainder, according to the Journal report, which cited anonymous sources. The new TikTok U.S. company would have a U.S.-dominated board that includes a member designated by the U.S. government, per the WSJ report. U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade talks Monday in Madrid, where China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters the two sides had reached a “basic framework consensus” for a deal to keep TikTok available in the U.S., according to a Reuters report. Reps for TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment. Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. The Trump administration has been trying to reach a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law while also being an arrangement that will be acceptable to the Chinese government. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. The transfer of ownership would result in TikTok’s current U.S. users having to download and install a new app, which will be wholly separate from the app as it exists in the rest of the world, per the Journal. The U.S. version of the app will have a content-recommendation algorithm that uses technology licensed from ByteDance, while Oracle will continue to manage and host TikTok’s U.S. data. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters.

Time Published: 2025-09-16T16:39:57Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s co-chief for the Middle East and North Africa and one of its top asset-management executives is set to leave the bank. Fadi Abuali is departing the New York-based firm after almost 28 years with the company, according to an internal memo. A Goldman spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. Abuali was instrumental in expanding Goldman’s franchise in the Middle Eastern and North Africa since he was appointed co-CEO for the region alongside Zaid Khaldi almost five years ago. The bank opened an office in Abu Dhabi in 2023 and last year became the first Wall Street lender to secure a so-called regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to anchor Goldman’s new private-credit and public-equity strategies in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf. As part of the bank’s push into Middle Eastern private credit, it is relocating London-based executive Deb Dutt to the region, Abuali said in a recent interview. Goldman asset managers in the Middle East have been in high demand, with Khalid Albdah, head of Goldman in Saudi Arabia and co-head of the regional asset-management arm, leaving late last year for Neuberger Berman. Earlier in 2024, BlackRock Inc. tapped Mohammad Al Fahim, who oversaw Goldman’s Abu Dhabi branch, to head its operations in the United Arab Emirates. Aside from the Middle East and North Africa, Abuali also jointly ran Goldman Asset Management’s international arm, serving as a key lieutenant to Marc Nachmann, global head of the bank’s asset- and wealth-management business, and was global co-head of the asset-management institutional-client business.

Title: This Energy Company Just Scored A $53 Million Contract And The Stock Is On Fire

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Turbo Energy S.A. TURB stock skyrocketed Tuesday after the company announced it won a $53 million contract to deliver energy storage projects in Spain with a total capacity of 366 MWh over the next two years. The deal involves more than 10 sites operated by a major construction industry client. Turbo Energy will integrate its systems fully and use its AI-based management platform to help the facilities cut power costs, improve efficiency, and expand electrification. Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, said the agreement highlights confidence in the company's storage technology. "By entrusting us with the deployment of our C&I systems across multiple industrial facilities, this project is not only validating our competitively differentiated storage technology but also enabling substantial operational cost savings," he said. Also Read: Solidion Technology Stock Explodes After Clean Energy Breakthrough Recognition The initiative will use Turbo Energy's SUNBOX Industry system, launched in 2024. With a range from 30 kW to 2,000 kW and storage capacity of 30 kWh to 4,000 kWh, SUNBOX Industry offers flexibility for industrial users. Its brand-agnostic design allows it to work with legacy infrastructure, easing expansion for customers facing volatile energy markets. The project advances both customer sustainability goals and Europe's decarbonization push. Turbo Energy said the expansion strengthens its role in large-scale storage and its commitment to cost-efficient clean power. Turbo Energy also revealed last week that it signed a landmark deal with Uber Technologies UBER to power the company's EV fleet in Spain. The project uses its SUNBOX Industry system to overcome grid constraints by adding flexible storage capacity, creating a 1 MW / 2 MWh smart hub capable of charging more than 300 vehicles. CEO Mariano Soria said the initiative showcases a scalable model for fleet electrification, underscoring the role of advanced storage in Europe's transportation decarbonization. ETFs such as the Invesco Solar ETF TAN and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN also provide exposure to the renewable energy market. Price Action: TURB shares were trading higher by 535.19% to $17.15 at last check Tuesday.

US stock market experienced a modest pullback on Tuesday as investors balanced optimism from strong consumer spending against uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated policy meeting. Despite the slight declines in major indexes, economic data revealed robust retail sales in August, rising 0.6%, well above expectations. This indicates that American consumers remain resilient even as inflation persists and the labor market shows signs of softening.

Title: Charlie Kirk Predicted: “AI Will Take Your Jobs in the Next Five Years”

Time Published: 2025-09-16T15:25:56Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedSeptember 16, 2025 “This is my broad opinion on AI (artificial intelligence),” said the man speaking to a crowd of over 1,500 students at the University of Tennessee. “For about 95% of what all of you guys are studying, AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” This comment is from last March, by the late Charlie Kirk during a visit to U of T’s Knoxville campus. Kirk answered a student’s question about studying AI, considering Kirk’s well-known skepticism of the value of much of what passes for education in current American Academe. The late Charlie Kirk, speaking at University of Tennessee last March. Courtesy Knox News/News Sentinel. Kirk was a humble person, and certainly never presented himself as a scholar on the topic of AI. So, he may or may not have been correct about that 95% number, and/or what havoc AI will wreak on the job market over “the next five years.” On that point, we must live, learn, watch, wait and see. Perhaps AI will eliminate less than 95% of jobs, and perhaps the looming juggernaut might take longer than five years to put many people out of work. But one way or another, Kirk nailed the point that a highly disruptive AI trend is taking shape. More on that in just a moment… Meanwhile, the AI investment boom has already delivered huge gains to investors who bought early, and even to investors who jumped aboard the proverbial moving train a bit late, as it left the station. For example, and to highlight just a few names among many, we’ve seen huge moves in share price for companies that make advanced computer chips (NVDIA Corp.; NVDA), and the machinery that makes chips (ASML Holdings; ASML); software plays and system integrators (Oracle Corp; ORCL); and certainly, with the energy angle that powers AI and ranges from electric utilities (Constellation Energy; CEG) to equipment makers (GE Vernova; GEV). Again, more on this this last angle in a moment as well… But first, no doubt you know that Charlie Kirk was gunned down last week while hosting one of his trademark debate events (“Prove Me Wrong!”), this time at Utah Valley University, outside of Salt Lake City. He was assassinated by a sniper who fired a single shot. And the shooter – the “alleged shooter” as we’re supposed to say – is in custody. The suspect is 22 years old and wasn’t associated with the university. Indeed, news accounts state that a couple of years ago, this guy dropped out of an entirely different college and enrolled in a trade school. He walked onto the Utah Valley campus last week for one reason only… As is almost always the case, right now there’s much we don’t know. The state and federal investigation is ongoing, although it’s not out of bounds to say that, based on recovered communications, perhaps the perp had associates. And perhaps he’s not just another “disturbed lone gunman” of popular myth when important people get shot. We’ll see. Plus, in this same context we have a developing, fast-growing narrative about how certain kinds of people become criminally radicalized by what they see and follow on the internet and social media (more accurately, “anti-social media”). Birds of a feather, so to speak. In fact, the man in custody appears to be a subset of disgruntled humanity that intelligence services refer to as “nihilist extremists.” As derived from the Latin word nihil, which means “nothing,” and the belief in a sense of nothingness. But in the case of certain individuals, they take their nothingness to the far edges of misconduct. In this particular case it was the cold-blooded public execution of a private citizen who also happened to be a nationally recognized public and politically influential figure. To me at least, the murder of Charlie Kirk is arguably the highest profile political assassination in America since the 1960s; since the days of Robert Kennedy, Sr. and Martin Luther King. (Note: President Reagan survived his 1981 encounter, just barely.) And this leads to a couple of points. Definitely (as in… obviously), many American colleges and universities lean politically left. Just visit a few campuses and walk around. And it’s not out of bounds – not for me, anyhow – to opine that a distressingly large number of impressionable young minds have been ruined by exposure to the Marxian milieus that dominate many humanities and social science departments within so-called “higher” education. Cartoon that speaks for itself. Courtesy Zero Hedge. Meanwhile, saving or salvaging young people from a lifetime intellectual handicap of early-onset, left-wing indoctrination was among Charlie Kirk’s missions in life, and brought him to his fateful, fatal visit to Utah last week. He was good at his job, so yeah, somebody shot him. At the same time, in this instance it’s evident that Kirk’s shooter was not radicalized in college; as noted above, the guy dropped out of a completely different school and there was no first-hand college knowledge inside this fellow’s head. In other words, with whatever degree of radicalism we have with Kirk’s assassin, he apparently picked it up on his own, inside the echo chambers of online content that he followed. Looking ahead, it’s likely that forensic investigators will scrub his internet history for everything they can find; maybe we’ll learn a few things. And this brings up something that I’ve heard from more than a few college and university faculty members. Namely, that many incoming students show up at the front gates already radicalized by their high school experiences at both public and private/independent secondary schools. So, the left-oriented indoctrination machine is not entirely a collegiate phenomenon because more than a few secondary schools have also been overrun and captured as well. Plus, an even broader issue is at work here. It’s that anymore, young people everywhere have grown up in an unfiltered world of smart phones and global-scale internet access to anything and everything that can flow through the fibers and Wi-Fi channels. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The takeaway is that we’re now reaping the harvest of about a (so-far) 20-year, uncontrolled, mass-psychological experiment. In essence, American society, and the nation’s overall economic system, allowed everyone – certainly children and young adults – to have constant, instant access to everything that’s out there in the ether. Which prompts one to ask, “Was this ever a good idea?” Sure, some kids have benefitted greatly from their lifetime of online access. Perhaps they became much smarter, much faster, at a much earlier age than otherwise might have been the case. Hey, maybe some of them now work for SpaceX, building better rocket engines. Or they’re changing the world for the better in other ways. But other people – obviously, look at the recent Kirk shooter – hung out online, fried their brain with antisocial content, and became dangerously radicalized. In short, they developed a deeply flawed moral compass and bizarre worldviews. Meanwhile, it’s not as if Kirk’s shooter is some sort of impressionable dummy. From news accounts the perp is supposedly an intelligent person. One report stated that he scored an impressive 34 out of 36 on the ACT, a high school standardized exam that’s widely used to rank applicants by college admission committees. And in this regard, Kirk’s shooter joins quite a rogues’ gallery of otherwise-intelligent people who traveled down a dark road. For example, Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old who shot President Trump last year in Butler, Pennsylvania reputedly scored over 1500 on his SAT exams, a result good enough to be considered as an entrant for even the most competitive of colleges. Or think back to other eras and instances when smart people went bad. For example, in the 1960s a young Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) earned a degree in mathematics from Harvard and then an MS and PhD in math from the University of Michigan. And going further back in history to 1865, a then-26-year-old John Wilkes Booth – among the greatest and fastest-rising Shakespearean actors of his era – assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. In this regard, it’s not as if political radicalization is a modern phenomenon. Nor even nihilism and extremism, because the archives of time reveal many young guys who crossed the lines and did terrible things. But anymore, it also appears that our internet age is capable of creating and spreading dysfunction and radicalization at wide, even industrial scale and affecting growing numbers of people. Here’s the quandary: we have an open system that leads more and more people to go nihilist, and then down extreme pathways. Which brings us back to Charlie Kirk’s comment about AI taking away jobs… “I love that,” said Kirk to his questioner. “I love the AI discussion because it’s going to flush out ethical arguments immediately. … It is going to force the greatest question of what is a human being? What is right? What is wrong? So I’m curious, at the University of Tennessee, what do they consider to be ethical?” Well, here we have some unusual questions! And from Charlie Kirk, who was upfront about the fact that he never attended college or university. He turned 18 and went into business with his Turning Point organization. Usually, public discussion of AI is about how great and wonderful it is. And about all the companies whose shares are soaring in the stock market. Or the hundreds of billions of dollars of capital investment going into hardware, software, data centers, electric power and more. Or the hype about what AI is already doing, and how it will eventually do even more and better in the future. That, and if “we” don’t somehow win the ongoing global AI arms race, China will win it and dominate the world. And there was Charlie Kirk in Knoxville, pondering the ethics of AI. Right away, one gets the sense that he foreshadowed his own eventual, tragic fate at the hands of a guy (or maybe a cabal of guys) who used existing online content to override any sense of classical ethics, and to spool himself/themselves to the point of targeted assassination. Another way to frame the issue is that the past 20-plus years of unfettered growth of the internet, and online access to anything/everything, has led to a national-scale level of political polarization that we see now (and certainly, with the above-noted nihilist extremist crowd). So, looking ahead, what might we expect from the next 20-plus years of AI? Well first, nobody knows, although this last question is absolutely worth pondering because AI is already many steps above the mere, day-to-day, old-fashioned internet thingy. Indeed, AI is a process that scrapes entire libraries of data from the online archives, and reshapes it and reforms it into… well, into what? Okay sure, it’s one thing for a high school or college kid to use AI to “help” write a term paper; and yes, I’m being charitable here. It’s quite another when AI takes over key elements of how we run society. Think in terms of AI-generated news, government policy stances, economic and even military decisions. (Whoops, too late; many military decisions are already AI-driven, up to and including when to fire weapons and at what targets.) Meanwhile, let’s return to Kirk’s comment that I used at the beginning of this note, about how “AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” Umm, yes… That’s already happening. Consider the news accounts of companies across the spectrum that are replacing people with AI, from banks and real estate to medicine and factory production. Just scan a few headlines about how difficult it is for young college grads to find jobs anymore, and how many young people are taking whatever work they can land, just to have a paycheck, versus finding a job in what they studied in school. So, per Charlie Kirk, AI will take away the jobs that college kids hope to have. And there, he has bracketed one key the point. What does the AI future hold? Well, the irony is that even big-name AI plays (the usual suspects) offer diminishing hope ever to justify their currently lofty share prices. That is, much of the AI race involves spending massive capex up front on equipment, buildouts, software and some sort of whiz-bang product to offer for sale. But the AI sales numbers – revenues that ring the cash register – are generally awful. And the dark implication is that all this up-front outlay is driving the broad sector towards commodity-level pricing, which means that few players will ever make any serious money. There’s an argument to be made that AI – well, AI as currently practiced – is a massive misallocation of resources, with next to no real forecast about what it will do to large and growing segments of the populace. Radicalization, anyone? Nihilism? Extremism? Hey, give it time. Sadly and tragically, we won’t have Charlie Kirk anymore, out there asking simple but insightful questions and debating the replies. In this regard, it falls to others to confront the orthodoxy of big money flowing willy-nilly into untested ideas and undiscovered lands. Oh, and if you have made some good money in AI, be sure to take a whack off the table and find another home for it when things begin to crater. Buy gold, for example. That’s all for now.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Microsoft Corporation MSFT said on Monday that its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, representing an increase of 8 cents, or 10%, from the prior payout. The dividend will be distributed on December 11, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2025, which is also the ex-dividend date. The company also set December 5, 2025, as the date for its annual shareholders meeting. Investors of record at the close of business on September 30, 2025, will be eligible to vote. Also Read: How To Earn $500 A Month From Microsoft Stock The dividend boost comes on the heels of strong quarterly results. In July, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter revenue of $76.44 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The revenue total beat a Street consensus estimate of $73.80. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.65, beating a Street consensus estimate of $3.37. For the first quarter, Microsoft expects sales in a range of $74.70 billion to $75.80 billion versus $74.07 billion analyst estimate. Analysts have highlighted Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence momentum as key growth drivers. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives described the company’s fourth-quarter results as “eye-popping,” citing strong demand for cloud services and AI products. “Microsoft delivered strong fourth quarter results with strong guidance to start the year as the company’s ‘shining moment’ is now underway with AI already changing the growth trajectory of MSFT’s cloud growth story,” Ives said. He pointed to the launch of Azure AI Foundry as particularly important for enterprise adoption, adding that fiscal 2026 could be the company’s “true inflection year” for AI-driven growth. “We believe Microsoft is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front,” he said. Other analysts have echoed that optimism. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey maintained an Overweight rating and raised his price forecast from $581 to $639. Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated an Outperform rating and lifted his forecast from $600 to $630. KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader upgraded the stock to Overweight with a $630 forecast. Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin also reaffirmed an Overweight rating, raising his forecast from $600 to $650.

Δ The new financing, announced Tuesday (Sept. 16), brings the company’s total funding to $144 million and will be used to invest in Invisible’s core AI software platform. A report by Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar with the matter, says the new funding values Invisible at $2 billion. “I have spent the last decade experiencing both the promises and limitations of enterprise AI, driven by the fact that 70% of the software in the world is over 20 years old,” CEO Matthew Fitzpatrick said in a news release. “Despite the recent excitement, most enterprises are still struggling to get AI models into production and to quantify ROI. Invisible changes that. Our software platform, combined with our expert marketplace, enables companies to organize, clean, label, and map their data. This foundation enables them to build agentic workflows that drive real impact.” The release notes that Invisible was named the number two fastest growing AI companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 List. The firm’s revenue more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, reaching $134 million, following a 24-fold increase between 2020 and 2023. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The company’s platform includes components such as “Neuron,” which the company says provides “flexible data infrastructure to integrate and transform structured and unstructured data,” and “Axon,” which employs “agentic automation to orchestrate tasks and decisions across systems.” The funding round comes at a time of increased focus on agentic AI, a topic that “is filled with gigabytes worth of opportunities and challenges,” as PYMNTS wrote Tuesday. “Even since summer’s end (just two weeks ago) this space has had its share of urgent developments, technical advancements and other innovations. All of which reinforce the momentum behind agentic AI,” the report added. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research finds that despite all the attention centered on Gen Z’s comfort with AI, it’s millennials who are using the technology at work.

Title: Mitsotakis: Reliable and costed fiscal policy is a fundamental principle

The impressive growth dynamics of the Greek economy were mentioned, among others, by the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who participated today in a discussion with BlackRock Vice President Philip Hildebrand and Adebayo Ogunlezi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, at the Athens International Investors Summit investment conference, organised by Yperat Fund and BlackRock. He stressed that the fundamental principle is a reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy so that fiscal and macroeconomic stability is not questioned, that the benefits from the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens, while he also highlighted the importance of defense, which he called the supreme European public good. The Prime Minister also had the opportunity to address, before powerful investment players with broad portfolios, the country’s prospects, investment opportunities, and challenges in several sectors, and the issues of green transition and energy. During the forum, the establishment of the Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund, which is the investment arm of the Super Fund, was announced. “We are growing at a much higher rate than the eurozone average, while at the same time reducing taxes, focusing on private investment, promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment,” the prime minister said during his remarks. “We have achieved all this in an environment of political stability. We have a government with an absolute majority. In 2023, the citizens rewarded us by giving us a new mandate. I think this sets us apart from many other European countries, because coalition politics can be very complicated,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis continued. “I think the big challenge, from a political point of view, is to link the macroeconomic situation to everyday life and work, in an environment where the cost of living has become a big problem,” the prime minister stressed. “I think there is a general understanding that this page turn is here to stay. My job is to ensure that the changes we have implemented are irreversible. That’s my commitment to the investment community and, frankly, the main reason why I want to seek a third term. To ensure that what we have achieved continues and that the wealth we are creating for the country is maintained. My first commitment in 2023 was to raise wages. When I see unemployment falling from 18% to 8%, that means that real wages are rising, Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted. “This is the only way to truly distribute wealth,” he added. Referring to the importance of reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy, the prime minister noted: “The fundamental principle of our approach has always been not to question the pursuit of fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The 2009-2010 crisis was a consequence of the spending derailment and our failure to focus on fundamentally restructuring our economy. We will not repeat the same mistake, ever. That is why our commitment to generate primary surpluses and, whenever possible, fiscal surpluses, will not be challenged.” The Prime Minister also stressed that the benefits of the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens through systematic tax cuts, with an emphasis on middle incomes, young people and families with children. “The biggest reform that has contributed to the state budget has been our ability to address the problem of tax evasion. This brought a lot of money into the public coffers, which we now have to return to the citizens. So we reduced taxes for the middle class. We have reduced taxes for families with children. We have reduced income tax to zero for those under 25 years of age. I want to encourage young people to join the workforce; I don’t want them to wait years. I respect young kids who go to technical school and enter the workforce at age 20. I want them to know that we are thinking about them,” he said. During the debate on the future of European defence, given the current geopolitical landscape, the prime minister said: “We will need to mobilise not only private but also public funds. We will need to mobilise European public resources for defence. I have been clear on this issue; I have spoken about it on many occasions. The recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace has brought to the fore something that we already know is a major problem, and that concerns missile defence and air defence systems in Europe. Therefore, my proposal is very clear: a pan-European tool for what I consider to be a pan-European good. And defence is the ultimate European public good. We cannot allow our national priorities to become an obstacle to tackling what is essentially an existential threat to Europe. Can this happen? The answer is that I see much greater potential. Some of the traditionally ‘frugal’ countries, such as Denmark and Finland, are much more open to the idea of joint European defence borrowing.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis also addressed, among other things, the issue of green transition and energy. “Greece has been extremely successful in adding renewable energy sources, both solar and wind, to our energy mix. We produce more than 50% of our electricity from renewable sources. Especially in spring or autumn, we have the possibility of having all our electricity generated for hours from renewable sources. For the first time this summer, we have also seen greater price convergence between Western, Central, and South-Eastern Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “We need more interconnections. We have become net exporters of electricity. This has never happened before. But, of course, we will need additional investments in baseload – in the case of Greece, we are talking about natural gas – and of course, investments in storage. This is the plan as to how we intend to proceed with the green transition in a realistic way, but also taking into account that for us, renewable energy sources constitute an important comparative advantage,” he added.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We’ve got a frankly, bizarre dynamic setting up in stocks right now. Global stocks are clobbering their American cousins this year. But here’s the disconnect: This is happening even though US stocks are hitting all-time highs seemingly every day. On the surface, it sounds like both of these can’t be true. But as we’ll see below, this setup makes total sense. We’ll also look at how we can play it for both offense—price upside, in other words—and defense (in the form of 8%+ dividends), too. Here we’re looking at the S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), in purple, compared to the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Index Fund (VEU), a good benchmark for global stocks (minus the US, as the name says), in orange. So what’s going on here? It’s only when we zoom out that things clear up: Over the long run, America’s lead is unquestionable—and it puts this year’s “blip” in much better context. This is why, if you subscribe to my CEF Insider service, you know I remain bullish on US stocks, particularly the high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold them. That’s because at CEF Insider we focus on dividends (often in the 8%+ range) and we think long-term. And while US stocks might trail for short periods, betting against America over the long term is always a mistake. But I do understand that more Americans are interested in buying international stocks. We can see that in the run they’ve put on this year: It quite simply wouldn’t have happened without Americans climbing aboard the global bandwagon. (America does, after all, have the highest percentage of stock investors in the world, at 55% of the population, going by the latest numbers from Visual Capitalist.) And holding at least some international stocks is just plain smart, especially if we see another April-style pullback in US markets. Beyond that, many international stocks pay higher dividends than US firms. Even looking across the northern border nets a considerably higher dividend yield, with index funds tracking major Canadian stocks yielding 2.6%, more than double the S&P 500’s 1.2%. But that’s still just 2.6%! Not nearly enough to fund a retirement on. VEU pays roughly the same. Then there’s VEU’s long-term underperformance, which I talked about a second ago. The main problem with VEU is that it’s simply too diversified. With its passive approach to owning just about everything abroad, it holds a lot of questionable companies in questionable countries. This is why actively managed funds (like the three 8%+ payers we’ll discuss below) have outperformed it in many cases. For instance, Tencent Holdings is one of VEU’s biggest positions, and the Chinese government has warned stock prices have gotten too high in the mainland as of late. That’s raised the possibility of new rules to limit stock speculation, which would hurt large stocks like Tencent. That’s why we want active management—especially in international stocks. That way we ensure we’re avoiding not just poor-quality companies but also those that operate in less-stable nations, where the rule of law may not be as strong as it is in places like North America and Europe. The three CEFs we’re going to discuss next give us that. Plus they’ve all beaten VEU (in green in the chart below) over the long term. And they’ve done so during a time when foreign assets were less popular among US investors. That sets them up for stronger gains now that more Americans are thinking globally. Let’s dive into them. The Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) gives us stock-like upside with convertible bonds acting as “ballast.” I say that because convertibles provide high, steady income, even in volatile markets. The result is a dividend that shows up every month and yields 8.1% on an annualized basis. With CHW, we’re effectively buying cash flow and the option to pivot between income-producing bonds and stocks, with both on sale; its largest positions—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and a Boeing (BA) 6% convertible preferred bond—let us tap surging AI growth, while the convertible bond dampens pullbacks with its steadier price and payouts. And because the fund’s mandate spans the world, management can shift with volatility. This flexibility has also helped keep the fund’s dividend steady over the last three years. Next up is the LMP Capital & Income Fund (SCD), with its combination of income-producing assets and capital-gains-producing stocks. The fund pays monthly, at a 9.3% annualized rate. And it’s cheap, too, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). SCD’s biggest positions consist of both tech darlings and utilities, with names like Marvell Technology (MRVL), Oracle (ORCL) and PPL Corp. (PPL) pairing growth and reliability. The result is a steady, diversified cash machine that can lean toward offense or defense without putting the dividend at risk. Finally, let’s talk about a less-obvious investment I like because it combines American blue chips and top foreign firms. The Virtus NFJ Dividend Value Fund (NFJ) captures income from foreign demand while blending in US firms, with their reliable regulations. It also generates extra income using a covered-call strategy that generates more income when global tensions rise. NFJ owns dividend payers and convertibles, sells call options and hands us a 9.3% dividend while trading at a steep 9.5% discount. The fund also uses zero leverage—a nice extra margin of safety should interest rates unexpectedly rise. With a portfolio dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL), AMD (AMD) and Prologis (PLD), this fund combines American giants with large margins and reliable cash flows with exposure to foreign demand (about half of Alphabet’s revenue comes from abroad, and about a quarter for AMD). Now, I’ve been saving the best part, and it’s this chart. SCD’s discount (in orange above) recently exploded to a premium before fading to its 6.7% discount. CHW’s 10.8% discount (in purple) has broken through the 10% mark a few times lately, and NFJ’s 9.3% discount (in blue) has narrowed quite a bit. On the whole, this tells us that more investors are noticing these funds, setting up their discounts to shrink further, putting a lift under their share prices as they do.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

Title: How Lyft’s CEO Got the Company Moving Again

What it takes to rebuild confidence, culture, and competitive edge. In the winter of 2023, Lyft was facing declining market share and financial pressures. Enter new CEO David Risher, who took the helm amid low morale and limited resources. His challenge: reignite innovation, refocus the culture, and find new ways to stand out in an industry dominated by Uber. Harvard Business School professor Ranjay Gulati joins host Brian Kenny to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” They explore how Risher led during a strategic crossroads, making bold decisions, putting the customer front and center, and shaking loose old habits. Gulati also shares insights from his new book, How to Be Bold, illustrating how courage becomes a competitive advantage in times of uncertainty. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we delve deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s pretty rare for an industry to go from zero to Mach speed in just a few years, but that’s exactly how it’s gone for rideshare services. Since the first peer-to-peer rideshare service launched in 2012, well over a billion people have climbed aboard. Today we’ll dive deep into this phenomenon with a case about Lyft, long the challenger in the ridesharing industry. They faced a choice: double down on product innovation, reinvest in a neglected brand, or simply shore up operations after years of crisis. With a new leader at the wheel, the firm was at a crossroad that called for bold, decisive leadership. Today we’ll unpack the case, discuss how boldness shapes corporate strategy and leadership, and explore what it takes to turn courage into a competitive advantage. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Ranjay Gulati to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Ranjay Gulati’s work explores leadership and strategic challenges for building high-growth organizations in turbulent markets. His new book, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage explores how individuals and organizations can cultivate courage, reframe fear, and act boldly in the face of uncertainty. In many ways, Lyft’s story provides a rich backdrop to test these ideas in action. And he’s also a fellow podcaster. Ranjay, welcome. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. Great to be here. BRIAN KENNY: You’re on the other side of the mic today. So, Ranjay hosts a show called Deep Purpose. You can find that on Apple or Spotify or wherever you listen, and it’s good to have you back on the show. It’s been too long. RANJAY GULATI: I know, Brian, it was great fun last time. I’m delighted to be back. BRIAN KENNY: This is a great case. I mean, we’ve all climbed into the back of a Lyft or an Uber, and those are the two major players, but by no means the only players in this space. So, the case actually comes in a little bit into their growth period where they’re facing some real significant challenges, and our protagonist is taking the helm there, and we’ll talk about all of that. So why don’t we just dive right in. I’m going to ask you to tell us what drew you to write about Lyft. Why did you think this would be a good case for the classroom, and what’s your cold call when you start the discussion? RANJAY GULATI: So, it’s interesting, when you write a case, you may start with one thing, and you may end up completely somewhere else. So, this is one of those stories where I started with a hypothesis about what the case was going to be about. It was really another illustration of a company that had a purpose as a founding principle and how they were trying to live by it. And the purpose was not to build a rideshare business. The purpose was to connect communities in places like Los Angeles, where the two founders were living. And so the idea was that a lot of people who don’t have access to a vehicle or parking or whatever are unable to connect, and it feels a fragmented, alienated life over there. So, this would be a way to bring people closer together. So, I was intrigued by how that kind of kernel of an idea became the basis of their strategy of how they were going to grow their business, about who they wanted to be. But then as I learned more, fast forward, what you discover is that for a variety of reasons, Uber comes into the picture, takes off, dominates, and suddenly now you are a one-third, two-third duopoly. Now, they’ve tried to differentiate and create some differentiation with their drivers and things like that, but even that is going away fast because the riders overlap across Uber and Lyft, so they’re not unique drivers anymore. Customers, you say, okay, I’m going to create stickiness for customers. Everybody has Uber and Lyft on their phone. They’re shopping across and choosing whoever’s the lowest price. Talk about commodity hell. So now what do you do? So, suddenly the case evolved from a study about just purpose to one about competing in commoditizing duopoly markets where the other competitor is bigger than you, has a more diverse revenue stream, can choose to make this a loss-leader. Now, how do you compete in this market? But then they became a third thing into the picture, which was now you have a new CEO. By the way, happens to be one of our alums, and he’s got to figure out, the founders are stepping away. Now you have this awkward transition where when founders set a step aside, professional management comes in and they got to figure out what do you do. BRIAN KENNY: What’s your cold call to start that discussion? RANJAY GULATI: I jump right into the case because I’ve had David Risher in class when I teach the case. So, I start by saying, “You’re David Risher. You’ve come into this business. What is your plan? What are you going to do in the first hundred days? What are you going to do in the first 300 days?” BRIAN KENNY: Wow. RANJAY GULATI: “And I want both plans nailed down, now.” BRIAN KENNY: That’s a brutal cold call. I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of that. So, David is the HBS alum that you mentioned. He’s the protagonist in the case. He’s the one who stepped in to this leadership role in 2023. How would you characterize some of the dilemmas that he was facing? What was he up against? RANJAY GULATI: He was up against pretty significant headwinds because they had come through a particularly brutal COVID because they entirely depend on rideshare, which essentially came to a grinding halt and took a long time to recover back. Meanwhile, Uber had Uber Eats, which was actually a dramatic growth business in COVID. So, here you have a competitor who’s really gained in the previous period, and you are coming from a place of weakness, from a place where you don’t have reserves to go and invest in something big. And so limited resources, layoffs, morale. So, you’re coming through the shadow of darkness over here, while those guys have just rode the wave through, and now you’ve got to find a way. And commoditization has really taken off, because drivers, you have two customers, right? The drivers who are now agnostic between Lyft and Uber, not always the case before. BRIAN KENNY: So, David Risher comes into a culture that already exists. The founders of Lyft had a pretty specific vision for what they wanted to do, and any leader stepping into that role is going to face the challenge of the legacy but also trying to drive the culture forward. What were some of the things that David tried to do? RANJAY GULATI: One of the first things David had to do was overcome internal inertia. And I think somehow sometimes organizations that have a great idea and execute on the idea; they were more successful beyond their wildest of dreams. Even though Uber was even bigger, and Uber has gone global and done all these things, Lyft was very successful. And what does success do to some? Not all, is it makes them fall into what I loosely call the success trap. And the success trap is now you become so fearful of losing what you have, you stop trying to win. And when you do that, you are caught in a vicious cycle of inability to try and experiment, learn, fail, grow. And so, you’re caught in a market that is stagnating, homogenizing, and you are unable to innovate your way into something new. David’s opening letter, what he said about himself, his self-introduction, is also very important because that gives you a kernel of where he’s trying to go. His first point, he says, “Listen, I’ve worked in three organizations. I worked at Microsoft, Amazon, and at this nonprofit.” And he says, “The three things I’ve learned is at Microsoft, I learned about the power of innovation. Innovation is what allows you to be competitive in the marketplace.” He said, “From Amazon, I learned the importance of customer obsession, that you can’t just be customer-centric, you got to be obsessed. It’s an emotional thing, not just a rational thing.” And he said, “From my nonprofit days, I learned the power and importance of frugality, doing more with less. How do you get things done with limited resources?” So, he was going to bring these three perspectives into Lyft. BRIAN KENNY: What were some of the things that came out of that? What were some of the initiatives that he really focused on early on? RANJAY GULATI: So, one of the initiatives that actually was on the cards, they had already debated and discussed it. It wasn’t even David’s original thought, but they had set it aside for whatever reason was this idea of matching female passengers to female drivers. And this was going to be mutually beneficial because many female passengers prefer a female driver. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes sense. RANJAY GULATI: Given all the, in fact, recent tragic stories we’ve been hearing about attacks on passengers. So that was one. But even for the drivers, turned out that many female drivers would not drive rideshare, and they would instead do food delivery, even though you earn less in food delivery than in rideshare. But they felt it was less safe. BRIAN KENNY: I see. RANJAY GULATI: So, they were going to attract these drivers who were doing food share, food deliveries into rideshare saying, we will guarantee only female passengers. It was an idea they already had but for some reason hadn’t executed it. It reminded me of Anne Mulcahy story. Anne Mulcahy was the former CEO of Xerox, which legendarily owned Xerox, PARC and had all these innovations that Apple ran off with, which was the graphical user interface on the mouse. And she said in my class one time, “We didn’t launch products. They escaped from us.” And I don’t know why in some organizations you see that where the ideas may be there, they percolate around, people talk about them, they debate them, then the naysayers kick in, and somehow they get shelved. BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. But it takes some bold leadership to actually revive that and push it through in an existing culture. How was David able to size up what he needed to do and move people in the same direction? Did he face opposition? RANJAY GULATI: In class, he’s talked about that. Yes, he did. But at least to jumpstart the process, leaders need to own it: OK, this is on me. This one’s on me, not on you. I’m not going to blame anybody else. This one’s on me. I own it. And that encourages others to then take ownership. And I think this willingness to step, you’re not going to become an autocrat and drive it constantly top down only. Eventually you’re going to build that confidence. I think people sometimes lose confidence. And then you need to boost up that confidence. And once you get them going, you’re then able to see the process unfold. And if you fast forward and see what Lyft has done in the last year and a half, you’ll see the positive results, the expansion into Europe, the now doing preferred driver choices, there’s a number of new things suddenly coming out of this company that actually was stagnating. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk about your new book because when I invited you to come on the show, I said, Is there a case that you think will help us to bring the ideas of your book to the surface? And you immediately landed on the Lyft case. Why does this case do a good job representing some of the big themes in your book? And maybe you can describe some of those themes to us. RANJAY GULATI: So, the book is called, How to Be Bold: The Science of Everyday Courage. The book is now about the individual level, two-thirds of the book about individual courage. And the last third is about organizational courage. But when I first began writing this book, it was about organizational courage. It was all about, How do you create courage? Now, when you think about the word “courage,” what is courage? Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is taking action in the face of fear. So, let’s get that out of the way. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I like that. RANJAY GULATI: The second thing is now if it’s about action in the face of fear, fear is a primal human emotion that is hardwired in the reptilian brain. It’s a survival emotion: Get out of here, save yourself. Now the question is, what activates that? It turns out there’s great research showing that what activates fear is the situational context of uncertainty. When we encounter uncertainty, it instantly activates fear. Now, let me go back, unpeel the onion one more. What is uncertainty? There was a very famous essay by Frank Knight, the economist, on the distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk is where you know the distribution of outcomes and you can put some probabilities on those outcomes. Uncertainty is, I don’t know. And if you look at present day and time, we are in an era of unprecedented uncertainty. In fact, in a recent article, somebody analyzed earnings calls by CEOs and found that in the last quarter, CEOs mentioned the word “uncertainty” three times as often as they did in the previous quarter. So, the word is out there; we all feeling it. When we experience uncertainty, the natural normal human response is one of fear. Now, the question then is, do we let fear take over? Because fear left to its own devices hijacks the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. And the typical response is one of freeze or flight. Now, if you look at Lyft back then, I didn’t interview them back then, so I don’t know what it was exactly like, but my hypothesis is that it had a freeze response. They were stuck and unable to do much about it. You’re in a market that is rapidly commoditizing. You have a competitor who is much bigger than you, who has diversified their income streams, and so is not totally reliant on this one business, which is the US ridesharing business. What are you going to do? So, to understand this strategic lock or freeze, you got to really understand organizations too have collective emotion, and fear becomes a paralyzing emotion unless you’re willing to face it. BRIAN KENNY: So, how does a leader go in and get people to have collective courage? You talk about collective courage in the case. It comes up in the book, I’m sure. How do you stoke that within an organization? RANJAY GULATI: So, let me give you an example from sports. One of the guests I had in my class many years ago now was Sir Alex Ferguson, the coach of Manchester United, the former legendary coach of Manchester United, for those who don’t know who he is. And one of the things he comments he made in class was that one of the hardest things he has to do as a coach is to take a winning team and make them come back and want to win again. So, somebody said, what do you mean? Are they lazy and complacent now they’ve won a championship? Because he won several. And that’s why in all sports, basketball, football, it’s very hard to see back-to-back championship. And he said, no, you know what happens is instead of playing to win, they start to play not to lose. They’re so fearful of losing. In sports terms, they’ll have the ball possession, but they’ll hold it in their half. They’ll defend more than play offense. And so you go into this defensive posture. So how do you unlock the organization to play offense, to look for opportunities for growth, to take calculated bets, to even walk into uncertainty because it is scary to do things that might not work, right? We want to de-risk it. We teach that stuff. Risk mitigation, risk management, we’re all about risk. Most of business is about risk. BRIAN KENNY: But back to your point about uncertainty, risk brings uncertainty. RANJAY GULATI: But they are separate ideas also. They’re adjacent, but separate ideas. How do we as leaders create the capacity in an organization to face uncertainty, to tackle the fear that is a natural correlate of that uncertainty and put the organization on a playing to win posture? That’s the leader’s challenge. How do you get them thinking upbeat? I’ll give you another example. I’m just finishing a case right now on a totally different company. It’s called Boston Scientific. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: Boston Scientific, in 2010, 11-odd, had done the second worst acquisition ever. They had acquired after AOL, Time Warner. Their acquisition of Guidant was the second worst acquisition, a $27 billion company. They had acquired Guidant for $28 billion. And the two together in a matter of a few years would be worth $4 or $5 billion. Massive destruction of value. So, in comes another CEO, and what is his tagline when he takes over? Winning spirit. Got to start to win again. And once you start to win again, winning is addictive. People want to win. People want to be on a winning team. You just got to give them a taste for what winning is. How do you jump start that? Yes, you need a brilliant strategy. Yes, you need to focus. Yes, you need to think about adjacencies for growth. Yes, you need to be customer obsessed. Yes, you got to figure out what are innovative ways to brand yourself in the market. But there’s an undercurrent beneath all that, which is this winning spirit. How do you get that going? BRIAN KENNY: And you mentioned that Lyft has seen some wins over the last few years. So, winning begets more winning, right? Winning gives you confidence. It makes you feel like you can do it. If you look at David Risher and what he did, are there examples in your book that you can point to that illustrate some of the things that David was able to do, examples of courage or infusing this winning spirit? RANJAY GULATI: So, you mentioned the word “confidence,” and there’s a very famous Stanford psychologist named Albert Bandura who studied something, an adjacent idea called self-efficacy, which relates to confidence. And it turns out that this idea of efficacy and confidence comes in two flavors. One is domain specific. We know our industry, we know our business, we know what we need to do. Now let’s just go do it, right? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: And David saw plenty of that in spades, I’m sure. But beneath that is another generalized form of self-efficacy. It’s a can-do mindset. No matter what comes our way, no matter what curve balls come our way, no matter how many setbacks we have, we got it. We can do it. And that can-do mindset, which is this generalized form of self-efficacy, which is, if you remember Apollo 13, Eugene Kranz tells his team, they have no textbook for this. There’s no manuals for the situation. Oxygen tanks have blown up. And now you have your command module, the LEM, the lunar entry module floating towards the moon. You’re going to use it as a life raft and slingshot their way back to earth. No one even simulated that idea. What does he say in his first meeting? Failure is not an option. Because people are like, oh my God, can’t do it, impossible, hopeless. So, how do you as a leader imbue in your team? Failure is not an option. We’ll have setbacks. We’ll make mistakes. BRIAN KENNY: But let me ask you this. When you say failure is not an option, one of the things we’ve talked about many times on Cold Call with different cases is that you have to allow for failure. You have to create a culture where failure is acceptable so that people are willing to take a chance to innovate in some way. RANJAY GULATI: Absolutely. Great observation. And so, you’re right, idea here is ultimate failure is not an option. BRIAN KENNY: Got it. RANJAY GULATI: But along the way, and you’re right, as we know about making it safe to fail and learning from that failure is critical to the journey of courage. And what is interesting about this, I’ll give you a nuanced idea that I also talk about in the book, is if you look at some of these leaders, including David Risher, I would imagine, how do you not only make it safe to fail, but how do you also deal with success? Because success itself can be complacency inducing. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: So, I think that is the challenge David is going to have now, now that they have some wins under their belt. That’s why you have people who fade away as athletes, just a taste of success and they’re like, OK, I’m done. And you know when I learned that was actually, I wrote a case and I talk about him in the book is Nick Saban, who’s the legendary coach of the University of Alabama football team. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: For those who don’t know him, this guy was unprecedented in terms of his record, everything else. And he has this model he called the process. It’s actually very Eastern spiritual in some ways. He wouldn’t say that. But because the idea is focused on the process, not on the outcome. And he learned that when he was coach at Michigan State and he was about to play Ohio State, which was much better team than theirs. And he went up and met a psychologist in the psych department and said, “I want to know how can I coach my team?” And the gentleman told him, he said, “Listen, just make them focus on each play, not on the score.” At halftime, they were way behind. At halftime, he called the team and said, “Don’t forget what I said to you. Don’t look at the score.” Miraculous turnaround, came and beat Ohio State. So that stayed with him. Losing and winning can confuse and distract you. So, at one level, you are intensely focused on winning, at another, you’re not letting it cloud your thinking. And I’ll share a small other example is Scottie Scheffler, golfer, you would know. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: He was paired up with Tiger Woods at the Masters. On the 12th hole, which is the par three, Tiger hit a 10. He had two balls in the water. It’s one of the lowest scores ever on that hole. He was immediately out of contention of the tournament, and Scheffler was shocked. But the next five holes, Tiger birdied them. It was like nothing had ever happened. Nothing had happened. So how do you face up to failure? How do you face up to fear? I think athletics, sports, there’s a lot of metaphor and real visual stories about that. BRIAN KENNY: Right, of course. RANJAY GULATI: I think for David coming into the job, I think before you get to strategy, he had this one idea. He put it out there and said, jumpstart guys, we can do it. Build up some confidence, self-confidence. We can do it. I think the hardest thing was to help them come out of this malaise where they were just lost. But having a one-off idea is not going to do it. Then you’ve got to build a strategy. So, for him, the next thing or piece of the puzzle was, what’s going to be our strategy? Everyone wants to have clear direction. Then how do you build conviction around that direction? At the same time, you’re doing all this you’re trying to jumpstart and revive your culture to be more performance and results and outcome focused. While you’re doing this with your, you’re trying to also focus on your brand and think about customers. How do customers experience you? A lot of times companies, his idea of customer obsession is also an important piece of the puzzle to think about. To me, what’s surprising from an earlier era of research I had done on customer-centric organizations, it’s fascinating how quickly companies, organizations, forget about their customer. Customers become an abstraction, a data point, a number, a market segment. You’re not thinking tangibly about customers. And in the case of a two-sided marketplace, which is what Lyft is, their customers are both the drivers and the passengers, and they don’t both always want the same thing. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: So how do you really build a customer obsession? So, your strategy, your culture, your actions, your winning is all connected to this thought process of customer obsession. So, I mentioned to you three things that David said he brought to the table. First was innovation, got to get the innovation engine going with a winning spirit. Second was customer obsession. Start thinking about our customers, both sides of them. And then the third one was frugality. In a market that is getting commoditized fast, and you don’t have scale advantage, which is what Uber has over them, you got to find a way to be frugal. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: Organizations struggle to subtract. And I think his frugality thinking is a way to understand that where should Lyft subtract so that they can add also. So, you’re playing addition, subtraction. How do you undertake both simultaneously? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I would imagine the overarching situation that any leader faces stepping into that kind of a role is how hard do I push? How do I balance all the things we’re trying to do so that the organization can withstand what we’re doing? RANJAY GULATI: Pacing change is another, you’ve now- BRIAN KENNY: You could write a whole book about that. RANJAY GULATI: Yeah, that’s a whole different topic, but I think it’s such a critical one. So, I think it’s really important to keep in mind that pacing change is the other piece of the puzzle. Building capacity to enact those changes. You can’t push it too fast, but you can’t push it too slow. So how do you pace that change coming in becomes very, very important. You need to build momentum, and this positive momentum becomes another key part of the puzzle. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Ranjay, this has been a great, you’ve given me a lot to think about, great conversation as I knew it would be. I’ve got one question for you before we end our conversation, which is simply, if you’d like our listeners to remember one thing about the Lyft case and about David Risher, what would it be? RANJAY GULATI: Courage is a source of competitive advantage. It is going to be the currency in times of uncertainty, because courage allows you to lean into that uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. It allows us to become comfortable with uncertainty. It allows us to, as you’ve heard many times from me in our conversation before, it’s okay with being scared. How do we learn to live with fear and make it a partner and a source of energy rather than want to freeze up? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I love that. Ranjay, your new book is, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage. Thanks for joining me. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. As always, it was lovely to talk to you.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Ad fraud hasn’t gone away – it’s getting more widespread with AI

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google’s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here – it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today’s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it’s not a problem that’s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. The scheme, dubbed “SlopAds,” relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN’s technical report, with the “Slop” moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to “cashout” domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. HUMAN described SlopAds’ use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, “The exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.” As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android’s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. “HUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,” added Kaye. HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack — from attribution to steganography — to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace. ‘Quite frankly, ignorant’: Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale rebukes The Trade Desk’s SSP ‘reseller’ tag The Trade Desk’s reclassification of all supply-side platforms as “resellers” faces pushback from major players like Index Exchange, who call it an oversimplification. This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk’s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk’s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon’s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon’s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal. The move helps Netflix ease buying and boost performance, as Amazon positions itself as the central hub of streaming’s growing ad economy. “This is actually going to be a problem for second-tier demand-side platforms. As ‘open web’ declines, you need to get in with the ‘hedged gardens.’” – An anonymous source reacts to news that “Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy.” A development that had a calamitous impact on The Trade Desk’s stock price. What’s next for Streamr.ai now that it’s been acquired by Magnite? Magnite announced it had acquired Streamr.ai, which specializes in developing AI-generated assets for small businesses to use in their CTV campaigns. Magnite CPO Adam Soroca explains more to AdExchanger. Scope3 lays off staff as part of shift toward agentic advertising Adweek discusses layoffs at the startup led by Brian O’Kelley. While the number of layoffs wasn’t confirmed in the piece, sources told Digiday the number was close to 20%, with the cuts impacting multiple departments, including former senior European leadership. With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google’s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side – the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google’s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer’s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google’s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema’s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors. Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience. The deal comes a week after Amazon announced a similar deal with Netflix, causing the stock price of rival DSP The Trade Desk to falter. The platform is rolling out broadly to both agencies and small- and mid-sized businesses that are looking to control more of their media investment destiny.

Hi OP, Is this prescription glass or normal? Is prescription glass additional cost? F @the eyewear guy would be great for this to be answered Price is for the nom prescription model. Lenses are additional. We don’t have any further info about the prescription lenses available in these meta until 23rd September. Zukko bought oakley? Meta acquired nearly 3% of EssilorLuxottica, which is the parent company of both Ray-Ban and Oakley. Big difference between the gen1 rayban meta compared to gen2. The tech will evolve rapidly with meta onboard I think. Launches 23/9? I've already had mine nearly 3 weeks - bought from Meta site…. that's the limited edition version that only comes in 1 colourway, I think? which is of course only limited to sunglass version No - I got the black with transition lenses delivered 3 weeks ago yesterday Which of these have the HUD in one eye? Seems like it's just the regular Glasses style that already existed. What's new if anything about this? Oakley META frames are the smart-enabled version of Oakley’s everyday frame. They incl Bluetooth audio, voice controls, and touch controls, but do not have integrated HUD or any display in the lens. Oakley’s previous “HUD” product was the now discontinued Oakley Airwave (for snow goggles), not the META line. So the answer is: none of the Oakley META glasses have a HUD in one eye. They’re audio-smart glasses only. Will you be stocking the Gen 2 Ray-Ban Wayfarers? Particularly the Limited Edition Translucent…..

The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. The late-night host criticised the Republican response to the killing and his suspension came after pressure from the regulator. The US president says illegal migration "destroys countries from within", as his two-day state visit to the UK comes to a close. Wales' first minister goes further with her explanations for not joining the US president. President Trump says he will designate Antifa as a terror group, but legal experts have questioned whether this is possible. The US and UK leaders fielded questions on Ukraine, migration, free speech and Mandelson among other issues. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Rolling Regressions in Clojure for Real-Time Alpha and Beta Monitoring
URL: https://clojurecivitas.github.io/finance/portfolio_analysis/alpha_beta_regression.html
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:00Z

Edward Widjaja cim Tanvi Nagar cim Matthias Buehlmaier cim September 16, 2025 This blog post presents a functional, reproducible implementation of rolling regression in Clojure to estimate time-varying alpha(α) and beta(β) for student-managed portfolios at the Centre for Investment Management (CIM), The University of Hong Kong. Unlike traditional CAPM tests based on passive index data, our analysis uses actual(synthetic) trades executed by junior portfolio managers- undergraduate students who manage simulated equity portfolios over multiple semesters. We use hypothetical trade data from student portfolio managers at the Centre for Investment Management, including: ● Trade dates, tickers, shares, prices ● Portfolio valuations over time(monthly rebalancing) ● Cash flows and position weights ● Returns are computed at the portfolio level, aggregated monthly from individual holdings. ● Benchmark: S&P 500 total return index ● Excess returns are calculated for both portfolios and the market. ● The risk free rate is omitted from analysis for ease of understanding concepts since it does not affect the final results presented in this proposal For each student portfolio, we estimate the CAPM regression over a rolling 12- or 24-month window: Using ordinary least squares(OLS), we obtain a time series of: ● Alpha(α): time-varying abnormal return(skill or luck?) ● Beta(β): evolving sensitivity to market movements(risk awareness?) ● Windows slide forward monthly, producing a dynamic view of performance. The full analysis pipeline is implemented in Clojure, designed for clarity, reuse, and integration into teaching workflows. Below are some core libraries that were used in the project. ● generateme/fastmath: for OLS regression and statistical operations ● scicloj/tablecloth: for data preparation and transformation ● clj-python/libpython-clj: to fetch price data using the yfinance library in Python ● org.clojure/data.csv: for inputting securities for analysis ● org.clojure/clojure.data.json: to parse JSON strings The below function uses a simple Python script (with the help of clj-python to integrate Python with Clojure) to fetch open and closing prices for NVIDIA stocks and the S&P 500 Index from Yahoo Finance. We can then obtain data as follows: Using the scicloj/tablecloth library, we transform our data, obtaining the stock and market closing prices and their dates. We continue with creating functions to calculate arithmetic returns, and calculating the day-by-day returns for the stock and the market. Now, this is where we implement our rolling market model, where we regress NVDA stock returns on the market returns using a rolling window to obtain sets of alpha and beta. To achieve this, we utilize the generateme/fastmath library to implement our very own rolling window regression function. Finally, we use these functions to obtain our sets of alpha and beta. Note that the size of the window is 252 to represent the number of trading days in a year. We present time-series plots of alpha and beta for multiple student portfolios across two academic years. While stock prices reflect market consensus, alpha and beta decompose returns into risk-adjusted components, revealing whether performance was due to systematic market exposure(beta) or true outperformance(alpha). This provides deeper insight than price alone, enabling informed evaluation of risk, skill, and value creation. The above charts show the alpha over time for NVDA(Nvidia) and the historical alpha tracking can help inform future trades. A close-up analysis of alpha reveals some interesting observations, for example: ● The declining trend in NVIDIA’s(NVDA) alpha relative to the S&P 500, as observed from October 2023 to July 2025, reflects a significant shift in the stock’s market performance dynamics. ● Initially exhibiting strong positive alpha-indicative of substantial outperformance over the broader market-NVDA’s excess return diminished steadily over time, converging toward zero by mid-2025. ● This erosion of alpha can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the normalization of AI-driven valuation premiums, increased competitive pressures from semiconductor peers, and a broader market environment characterized by robust S&P 500 performance that reduced NVDA’s relative advantage. Similarly, the above charts reveals some trends regarding the beta of the NVDA(Nvidia) stock: ● The time series of NVIDIA’s(NVDA) beta relative to the S&P 500 reveals a significant evolution in the stock’s sensitivity to market movements over the period from October 2023 to August 2025. ● Initially, NVDA exhibited a beta around 2.0, indicating that it was approximately twice as volatile as the broader market. Over the course of 2024, beta steadily increased, peaking near 2.9 in early 2025, reflecting heightened market exposure and amplified price swings during periods of strong investor enthusiasm for AI-driven growth. ● This elevated beta suggests that NVDA was behaving as a high-risk, high-reward asset, with returns highly correlated to-and often magnified by-market trends. However, beginning in April 2025, beta experienced a sharp decline, falling to 1.985 by August 2025, signaling a reduction in its volatility relative to the market. This decrease may reflect a combination of factors: valuation corrections, reduced speculative positioning, and a shift toward more stable, earnings-driven investment behavior. Hence, a portfolio manager when looking at the historical performance of NVDA, will be able to evaluate if the trade is adding value to their portfolio. A stock with a rising alpha and lower beta is a good sign for investment, since it presents a higher return for a lower level of risk. An evaluation of single stocks comprising a portfolio will give a good visual analysis of the stocks risk and return and the overall portfolio. A similar analysis can be conducted at the portfolio level as well to understand the portfolio manager’s performance- alpha creation against the market similar to an AMC tracking a fund’s performance. Rolling alpha and beta are not just statistics-they are mirrors. They allow students to: ● See the consequences of their strategies ● Distinguish luck from skill ● Adjust risk in response to market regimes This system has direct real-world applicability: ● Can be scaled to real fund management with minimal changes ● Provides a template for risk dashboards in small asset managers ● Integrates with automated compliance or alerting(e.g., “beta increased by 30% this month”) By turning student trades into living data, we move beyond theory to reflective practice. And by building in Clojure, we ensure that the system is not a black box—but an open book. In simple words we can decipher, the best financial models don’t just describe the world—they help people learn from it. ● Expand to multi-factor rolling models(e.g., FF3: market, size, value) ● Build a web dashboard using ClojureScript(Reagent) for real-time feedback and interactivity ● Implement automated alerts(e.g., “your beta has exceeded 1.5”) ● Add peer benchmarking: compare alpha trajectories across students ● Integrate with portfolio optimization tools for next-step recommendations ● Use the pipeline as a capstone module in investment management courses

Title: Google parent company Alphabet valued at $3 trillion for first time

15.09.2025, 20:57 Uhr A jump in the share price of the Google parent company Alphabet on Monday saw its value on the New York stock market rise above $3 trillion for the first time. Alphabet's A shares recently rose by around 4% to $252 on Wall Street. This made them one of the strongest performers in the Nasdaq 100 technology index. By breaking through the three-trillion-dollar mark, the A and C shares of Google's parent company crowned their rally since the beginning of April, when the A shares were only trading at around $145. The shares have gained almost 60% in the past year. This makes Alphabet the fourth most expensive company on the US stock market. Only tech giants Apple, Microsoft and â as the most valuable company â chipmaker NVIDIA, which is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, have a higher market valuation. Analysts see room for further price gains at Alphabet. The trigger for the recent rise was the US bank Citigroup raising its price target for A shares from $225 to $280. Alphabet, along with Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Facebook's parent company Meta, Amazon and Tesla, is one of the "Magnificent Seven" companies listed on the US stock market. The tech giants set the pace for global stock markets and carry significant weight in index funds (ETFs) such as the MSCI World or the S&P 500, which are popular with private investors. powered by dpa-newslab | Legal Notice | About Us / Contact | Privacy

Full Content:
CoreWeave (CRWV) said Monday it has signed a $6.3 billion initial order with Nvidia (NVDA) with a condition that the AI chip star buys unsold capacity, sending shares in the cloud computing platform surging. As part of the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any unsold cloud-computing capacity through April 13, 2032, if CoreWeave’s data centers aren’t fully utilized by its own customers. CoreWeave made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said the deal was struck on Sept. 9. Nvidia has ties with CoreWeave on several fronts. Apart from being a customer, Nvidia sells its chips to CoreWeave and has a stake in the cloud platform. Apart from Nvidia, CoreWeave’s customers include Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META). Separately, on Monday, Deutsche Bank added CoreWeave to its Catalyst Call Buy Idea List, citing “a few positive factors" that will support revenue revisions upward over the next quarter or two. CoreWeave will benefit as “spending intentions being signaled by those in industry and the scale of some of the recent contract announcements make demand for AI infrastructure appear almost insatiable and at least for the near-to-medium-term, demand significantly outstrips supply," wrote analyst Brad Zelnick. CoreWeave shares are rising almost 7% in intraday trading Monday and have gained more than 200% since going public in March this year in one of 2025’s hottest IPOs.

Title: Top Stock Movers Now: Tesla, Intel, Nvidia, and More

U.S. equities were higher at midday on positive comments about China trade and the future of TikTok from President Trump, as well as Tesla (TSLA) news. S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Tesla shares jumped as a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk purchased 2.57 million shares of the electric vehicle's stock valued at about $1 billion. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) traded above $200 for the first time on continued excitement over the company's new hard disk drive for artificial intelligence data centers. Intel (INTC) shares climbed after the struggling semiconductor maker reduced its target for full-year non-GAAP operating expenses after completing the $3.3 billion sale of a majority stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares were up for a third straight session, making the parent of Google the fourth company with a $3 trillion market capitalization. Corteva (CTVA) was among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 following a report that the manufacturer of crop seeds and pesticides is looking into splitting itself into two separate companies. Some chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), fell as Chinese regulators were investigating potential dumping of analog integrated circuit semiconductors from the U.S. U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca (AZN) declined after a report the drugmaker had paused a planned $272 million investment in Britain, and received a downgrade from Europe's Handelsbanken. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dipped.

Manage your account ... The 2025-26 NBA season is almost here, and with it comes my position-by-position fantasy basketball tiers, starting with the guards. This guide is points-league focused but includes insights for category formats as well. [Join or create a fantasy basketball league for the 2025-26 NBA season] Let's kick it off with two players who will drive much of the MVP conversation this season. Editor's note: Players are listed based on their primary position from last season or projected role this year. Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder Luka Dončić: Luka enters his first full Lakers season healthy and in shape, ready to deliver close to a nightly 30-point triple-double. Even in a down year, he dropped 28-8-8. His blend of usage, shot volume and all-around production makes him one of the safest fantasy picks available. With efficiency improvements and better conditioning, he could push for a top-three finish across formats. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: SGA and Luka were the only guards to average over 50 FPPG last season. After a legendary season finishing as the scoring leader, MVP, Finals MVP and champion, SGA's floor is top five across all formats. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers Anthony Edwards: Edwards continues his ascent as Minnesota’s offensive centerpiece, combining highlight-reel finishes with steady statistical growth. His scoring is already elite, but his rebounds and assists have begun to rise, too. With another leap in efficiency, Edwards could join Tier 1 next season. Cade Cunningham: There's a chance Cunningham can sneak into the elites. He averaged 48 FPPG last season, so another leap forward for him and the Pistons in a weaker Eastern Conference can push him into 50 FPPG territory. Devin Booker: The only thing preventing Booker from being a savage offensively is a possible late-season tank. I don't see it happening, so expect Booker to put up top-tier points and assist numbers. Trae Young: Trae’s elite assists and scoring floor make him one of the best points-league guards. Turnovers and poor shooting don’t impact his value as much, so bank on him being one of the few players getting at least 24 points and 10 assists a night. Tyrese Maxey: I'm higher on Maxey than the consensus. Maxey posted the sixth-most FPPG among guards last year. Those numbers are going up with Joel Embiid and Paul George undoubtedly missing games. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors De’Aaron Fox, San Antonio Spurs Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers Stephen Curry: I'd draft Curry higher in category leagues than points because his 3s and high FT% are more statistically relevant. Still, he'll likely be a top-10 scorer in the NBA who also generates enough counting stats elsewhere to warrant an early pick in points leagues. De’Aaron Fox: Fox gets a full offseason to prepare to play with Victor Wembanyama, so an uptick in assists as the primary creator elevates his value. He finished in the top 10 in FPPG among guards last season, averaging 41 FPPG. Jalen Brunson: The engine for the Knicks has one of the safest floors for a guard. He'll likely go in the first three rounds of drafts, but be aware that the minutes are likely to dip under new HC Mike Brown. LaMelo Ball: Injuries always hold him back, and it's reflected in his ADP. When healthy, though, Ball is capable of being a top-10 scorer amongst guards in FPPG. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets Desmond Bane, Orlando Magic Derrick White, Boston Celtics Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets Ja Morant: Few guards are as explosive as Morant, capable of putting up 25/7/5 lines on any given night. The risk is obvious — injuries and off-court issues — but the reward is massive if he plays 65+ games. He’s a swing pick with league-winning upside. He's way better for points formats since you can ignore the poor FT shooting, turnovers and lack of 3s. Josh Giddey: He inked a new contract, plus was one of three players to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game last year. The other two? Luka and Nikola Jokić. Giddey can push for over 40 FPPG this year. Amen Thompson: With Jalen Green gone, Thompson steps into a bigger role in Houston’s offense. His rebounding and defensive stocks make him an unusual fantasy guard with multi-category upside. If his jumper stabilizes, it'll more than justify a third-round selection, even for points leagues. Desmond Bane: Bane is a solid 30-35 FPPG scorer, but he'll be in a new environment, playing alongside Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. I prefer Bane in category leagues, but he'll have the counting stats to warrant a pick around the fourth or fifth round. Jalen Green, Phoenix Suns Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Poole, New Orleans Pelicans Zach LaVine, Sacramento Kings Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks Coby White, Chicago Bulls Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets Anfernee Simons, Boston Celtics Jalen Green: Green gets a huge bump after getting traded to the Suns. Volume is king for points leagues and he'll get plenty of opportunities as the secondary option to Booker. He's much better for points than category leagues. Cam Thomas: Thomas still hasn't signed his qualifying offer with the Nets. We'll have to wait and see how long his contract situation plays out. Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. are going to have a ton of scoring opportunities playing for Brooklyn. Darius Garland: Garland should be a tier higher, but he underwent surgery on his toe in June with a recovery timeline of 4-5 months. I don't expect to see him in uniform until November. When fully healthy, he should average north of 35 FPPG. Dyson Daniels: The NBA's Most Improved Player took a massive step forward last season. However, Jalen Johnson was hurt for the majority of the season, and the team wasn't as equipped as it is now. I'm expecting some regression despite Daniels averaging 37 FPPG in 2024-25. Fred VanVleet: FVV loses value in points leagues because his 3s, steals and FT% don't carry as much weight. Still, he's a useful PG capable of putting up at least 30 FPPG. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto Raptors Andrew Nembhard, Indiana Pacers Jalen Suggs, Orlando Mag Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics CJ McCollum, Washington Wizards Bennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers Norman Powell, Miami Heat Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Clippers Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers Christian Braun, Denver Nuggets Immanuel Quickley: Quickley is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign. He averaged 31 FPPG when he played, so it's something to build off of playing with Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram and Jakob Poeltl. Andrew Nembhard: Nembhard is one of my favorite breakout candidates with Tyrese Haliburton being ruled out for the season. His skill set fits better with category leagues, but I'd also consider getting shares in points leagues. CJ McCollum: McCollum's ADP is just outside the top 100 over the past seven days on Yahoo. He's becoming a value, especially for points leagues. I think he'll play a lot of minutes for the Wizards until a mid-season trade likely sends him to a contender. Shaedon Sharpe: Sharpe’s athleticism pops every night, and he’s starting to find consistency as a scorer. Portland is giving him freedom to develop, which means more usage. He's on the verge of becoming a 20-point scorer in this League. Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee Bucks Keyonte George, Utah Jazz D’Angelo Russell, Dallas Mavericks Jaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls Davion Mitchell, Miami Heat Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz Quentin Grimes, Philadelphia 76ers Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings Keyonte George: George had growing pains last year, but his court vision and scoring style — reminiscent of Jordan Clarkson — make him worth the gamble. If his efficiency stabilizes, he could jump to Tier 6 quickly. Brandin Podziemski: Podziemski is one of the rare guards who rebounds like a forward. Golden State trusts him with meaningful minutes, which ensures a solid floor. If Curry misses time, his value skyrockets. Stephon Castle: Castle will start at SG and offers some nice counting-stat potential heading into his second NBA season. He's a better asset for points leagues because his efficiency and lack of 3s remain an issue. Davion Mitchell: Once he was traded to the Heat last year, he was finally able to carve out a meaningful role. His defense is infectious and he looked far more comfortable shooting the ball and acting as a primary facilitator than he did with the Kings and Raptors. He's one of my sleepers whom I'll be selecting in the later rounds of drafts. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Atlanta Hawks Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets Tre Johnson, Washington Wizards Anthony Black, Orlando Magic VJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ers Rob Dillingham, Minnesota Timberwolves Bub Carrington, Washington Wizards Scoot Henderson: Henderson’s early career journey has been volatile. Bringing in Jrue Holiday likely puts him back on the bench. Perhaps a sixth-man role could pan out. Either way, he's better for points leagues than category if he continues getting 27 minutes a night. Cason Wallace: Wallace thrives as a low-mistake, high-efficiency rotation guard. OKC trusts him in high-leverage minutes, which locks in his role. I think we'll see his role expand this season, making him a fantasy asset in more category leagues than points leagues. Tre Johnson: Outside of Cooper Flagg, Johnson has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year. The injury to Bilal Coulibaly should expedite his fantasy impact as well. Rob Dillingham: The second-year guard looked great at Summer League. Mike Conley is getting older and Nickeil Alexander-Walker left in free agency, so they'll need Dillingham's speed and scoring punch off the bench. He's a bucket who will emerge as a points league guy this year. Russell Westbrook III, Free agent Donte DiVincenzo, Minnesota Timberwolves T.J. McConnell, Indiana Pacers Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers Jrue Holiday, Portland Trail Blazers Klay Thompson, Dallas Mavericks Collin Sexton, Charlotte Hornets Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City Thunder Caris LeVert, Detroit Pistons

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft's stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has climbed over 30% in the past six months, driven by strong quarterly results marked by improving revenue growth and expanding margins. However, with the stock now trading at 37 times its trailing earnings, the key question for investors is whether MSFT is still worth buying. We believe MSFT stock currently looks expensive due to its elevated valuation. Our view is based on a detailed analysis comparing the stock’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and its overall financial position, both current and historical. While Microsoft shows strong operational and financial performance, these strengths already seem priced into its lofty valuation, as outlined below. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with lower volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?

While Azure’s growth could convince some investors that an even higher multiple is justified, we think from a risk standpoint it’s better to wait for a price pullback before buying MSFT. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a consistent track record of outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with lower risk versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The consulting industry is on track to get upended, and we'll all have to deal with the consequences

Welcome back! The older you get, the tougher it can be to bounce back from the weekend. But if Sam Altman's startup gets its way, aging doesn't necessarily mean decline. BI's Hilary Brueck looked at how Retro Biosciences is developing a pill to clear out the "gunk" in your brain. In today's big story, the consulting industry is on the cusp of a big overhaul, and the rest of the business world is likely to feel it. What's on deck: Markets: Forget equity, this hedge fund just wants a cut of revenue from the tech companies it backs. Tech: It's tech news, but treat it like a spectator sport. Why people love "TBPN." Business: A Real Housewives star and former Netflix exec walks us through her daily routine. But first, the synergies are no longer synergizing. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A key pipeline for funneling talent into white-collar work has sprung a big leak that won't be easy to fix. A combination of AI, shifting customer demands, and tougher paths to promotions means the consulting industry is on the cusp of being completely reshaped, writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Consultants are no strangers to volatility. In fact, a big part of their business is advising clients on the best ways to navigate change. But the current trends giving consultants plenty of work — operating more slimmed-down workforces and leveraging AI — are also impacting their own ranks. Analysts told Jennifer that the end result isn't clear, but early signs point to a tightening of senior and junior roles in the industry. BI's Polly Thompson, our resident consulting expert, has extensively reported on these trends. PwC, for example, plans to cut college graduate hiring over the next three years, with AI cited as a primary reason. That's also trickling upward as senior employees head for the exits, with several unhappy about dwindling pay and a shrinking window to reach the profession's pinnacle: partner. The rest of the business world will likely feel the effects of an upheaval within consulting. Love them or hate them, consultants are undeniably a part of the fabric of corporate America. One direct impact is the work they do with clients across the globe. Got a big business decision to make? Chances are you're going to bring in a consultant for some advice. As those firms reshape themselves, the way companies interact with, or even pay for, consultants could change. But it goes beyond that. Consulting often represents young people's foot in the white-collar workforce door. Work on a project for a few years for a client and then eventually go in-house. As the number of junior consultants dwindles, that could disrupt how countless companies stock their ranks. Those converts can also go on to do big things. Sheryl Sandberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jamie Dimon are just a few examples of high-profile consulting alums. But if anyone is well-suited to navigate a quickly moving landscape, it's consultants. After all, that's what the rest of us all pay them so much for. And if all else fails, they could always hire … a consultant. Commercial real estate is going Hollywood. You've heard of "Selling Sunset." Now get ready for "The Real Estate Commission," A&E's upcoming show about the epic highs and lows of being a commercial real estate dealmaker. Its star, Todd Drowlette, gave BI a behind-the-scenes look at the first season. A new fund wants to give tech companies the royal(ty) treatment. Althera42 wants to invest in Europe's digital infrastructure, like data centers and cloud computing, with a slight twist. Instead of getting equity, Althera42 provides capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues. The idea is to bring the investing playbook behind music royalties to tech. Beware of the gigantic price bubble. David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and a stock-market bear, warns of negative S&P 500 returns due to high valuations. The Shiller CAPE is at its third-highest level of all time. That's not the only reason Rosenberg is skeptical. Want to become fluent in tech bro? Watch "TBPN." For three hours, five days a week, hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the online show Technology Business Programming discuss tech industry drama like a spectator sport and chat with investors, founders, and sometimes journalists. BI's Julia Hornstein tuned in for a week to understand why it's become a must-watch for the chronically online tech crowd. Polymarket is about to cash in on a US expansion. The betting site, known for predicting Trump's presidential win in 2024, is raising another funding round that would sharply increase its valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Investor demand has risen as Polymarket appears ready to launch in the US. Big cuts at Musk's xAI. Elon Musk's AI startup laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team. xAI is now prioritzing specialist AI tutors over generalists, according to multiple messages viewed by BI's Grace Kay. How Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John does it all. At 5:30 am every morning, the former Netflix CMO is already meditating and praying. For BI's Power Hour series, Saint John shared her daily routine, from running a hair-care company and hosting a new Jimmy Fallon show to being a single mom. The world's richest men are buying huge media companies because they can. In 2022, Elon Musk bought what we used to call Twitter. That's what Larry Ellison is considering today by financing his son David's plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery weeks after buying Paramount. It's unlikely anyone will stand in the way, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Breaking up is hard to do. Especially when you're trying to break up with your employer of many years.

Title: Can Natera Stock Reach $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-natera-stock-reach-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T14:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Let's start with something remarkable. Natera (NASDAQ: NTRA) just marked its 10th anniversary as a public company, and what a journey it has been. The stock has delivered nearly 10x returns, rising from its $18 IPO price to around $170 today. Even more impressive, revenues have also expanded about 10-fold from $190 million to $2 billion. And the momentum hasn’t slowed — revenue growth over the last twelve months was a stellar 44%. So, what’s fueling this growth? It comes down to one word: intelligence — specifically, medical intelligence. Natera has placed itself at the forefront of molecular diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and monitoring. Think of them as medical detectives, helping doctors detect issues at the genomic level before they become life-threatening emergencies. The company focuses on three main areas: women’s health, oncology, and organ health. Their flagship product, Signatera, is a game-changer. This personalized tumor-informed test uses a simple blood draw to detect circulating tumor DNA and monitor for molecular residual disease across multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. This isn’t just an incremental improvement — it’s a revolutionary technology transforming how oncologists monitor their patients. But what makes their technology stand out? Its beauty lies in its simplicity and precision. Rather than invasive procedures, patients undergo a simple blood draw — a liquid biopsy. But this isn’t an ordinary blood test. Natera’s platform can detect tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, offering doctors unprecedented insight into cancer progression and recurrence risk. Beyond Signatera, Natera also offers Altera for genomic profiling and Empower for hereditary cancer screening — creating a comprehensive suite that covers the entire cancer care spectrum. Before we dive into Natera stock’s specific metrics, it’s worth noting an important reality: investing in high-growth companies like Natera comes with volatility. While the upside can be significant, the ride is often bumpy. If you want high-quality growth with lower volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark — a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes — with returns exceeding 91% since inception. This diversified approach provides exposure to high-quality growth names while managing single-stock risk. On a separate note, see – What’s Happening With ABBV Stock? Now, let’s explore why Natera’s story is so compelling. Here’s where things get exciting. In the latest quarter, Natera processed over 850,000 tests, generating $546.6 million in revenue. About 22% of these tests were oncology-related, and this segment is growing at 50% year-over-year. This is the key engine driving future growth. Let’s zoom out. Cancer recurrence is every survivor’s worst fear, yet traditional monitoring often leaves patients waiting months for clarity. Nearly 19 million U.S. cancer survivors live in constant uncertainty between scans. They need better tools to track their cancer status, representing a massive market that will require sophisticated monitoring for decades to come. Now, we believe Natera can sustain 25% annual revenue growth over the next few years. That would boost revenue from about $1.7 billion last year to around $7 billion in 2030 — a 4x increase. For context, they’ve grown revenue at an average of 40% over the past three years, so 25% is actually not that aggressive. You might ask — is there room for a company this size to keep growing? Absolutely. The cell-free DNA testing market — which includes what Signatera does — is expected to almost double from $11 billion today to around $20 billion within five years. [1] Natera isn’t just riding this wave — they’re helping shape it. Consider the competition: Roche leads diagnostics with $16+ billion in revenue, followed by Danaher at $10 billion and Abbott at $9 billion. Natera’s $2 billion shows they’re still in the early innings of their growth story. The growth path breaks down into several key areas: How could $7 billion in revenue translate to a $500+ stock price? The math is compelling. If Natera hits $7 billion while maintaining its current price-to-sales multiple of 13x, the stock could reach about $700. Even with multiple compressions to 10x, that’s still well above $500. This assumes minimal dilution, which is reasonable given its cash-generation potential at scale. Yes, the company is currently loss-making, but as revenue grows, margins should turn positive. Natera’s net income margin has improved from -75% in 2021 to -13% now. Diagnostic market penetration takes time. For Natera to be valued at $50B, $100B, or even $200B (vs. $23B today), investors must think long-term — 2030 and beyond — with billions of tests processed annually worldwide. By 2035, liquid biopsies could be as routine as cholesterol tests. Still, several factors must align: Despite the opportunity, key risks remain: Natera is a genuine growth story driven by breakthrough technology addressing massive markets. It has scaled impressively while sustaining momentum that most CEOs would envy. The path to $500+ per share is mathematically feasible — but execution must be flawless. For risk-tolerant investors, this offers high growth with meaningful upside — balanced by real execution and market risks. For a more diversified approach, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its benchmark of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Its quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap names has delivered strong returns while cushioning losses in down markets (RV Portfolio metrics). The opportunity is real — the question is whether Natera can execute and whether investors can stomach the volatility for what could be a rewarding ride. 1.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/solana-price-prediction-sol-price-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:30:57Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Solana has been on a remarkable run lately. The price of SOL has surged by about 80% over the past six months and is now trading well above all its key moving averages. This impressive performance is supported by strong momentum, including its total value locked (TVL) reaching a record $13.22 billion and a surge of institutional investment. But the big question is—what would it take for SOL to double from here and surpass the $500 mark? Let’s explore what could drive that move. That said, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock or token, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Explosive rallies like this may seem extreme, but they are not uncommon in the crypto space. Here are some recent examples: With these catalysts lining up, could Solana be on the brink of its next big move? We’ve discussed the upside, but what about the risks? No investment is without challenges, and Solana is no exception. Here’s what could hold it back: While the outlook seems positive, such rapid growth is never guaranteed. The crypto market is highly volatile, and success depends on Solana’s continued execution and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The RV Portfolio’s quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks enables it to capture market gains while limiting downside in weaker conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. So, can Solana really hit $500? The fundamentals are compelling. With record TVL on the network and major investors piling in, the stage is set. Catalysts like a potential ETF approval and Solana’s booming ecosystem could drive a massive rally. Still, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Title: Executives Remain Skittish About Buying Their Own Shares
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/15/executives-remain-skittish-about-buying-their-own-shares/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:15:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Lately, insider buys by companies’ chief executives have been scarce. Executives normally sell more shares than they buy because their cup is periodically refilled with stock-option grants. Over the past 21 years, dollar volume for buys has usually run about 34% of the volume for sales, according to Gurufocus.com. Buying has been below normal in 13 of the past 15 months. In August, buys were only 26% of sales. The highest ratio of buys to sells, 2.01, was in October 2008, when much of the country was in despair as the Great Recession rolled on. The executives who bought 17 years ago looked smart when the economy recovered in 2009. Let’s look at a few companies where insiders bought last month. Remember Eastman Kodak? You used to buy its film for your camera, if you’re old enough. Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN) was spun off from Eastman Kodak in 1994. Coating, adhesives, and specialty plastics are among its products. The chief executive officer, Mark Costa, and the chief financial officer, McLain William Thomas Jr., made sizable purchases on Aug. 27. Costa bought about $502,000 of shares, Thomas about $252,000. Several other Eastman executives bought shares the same day. The stock has fallen 24% this year, partly because Eastman is hurt by tariffs more than most companies are. It imports materials from several European countries and from Brazil and India, which are being hit with particularly high tariffs. Yet the company has shown a profit for at least 30 years in a row. The stock now sells for about nine times earnings and less than one times revenue – far below its typical multiples. I think it will recover. In August, eight Eli Lilly (LLY) executives bought Lilly shares, and two sold. Buyers included the chief executive, David Ricks, who spent just over $1 million, and the chief financial officer, Lucas Montarce, who shelled out almost $495,000. The pharmaceutical company’s shares traded as high as $942 last summer, but have come down to about $755. Apparently, Ricks and Montarce think it’s now attractively priced. I don’t. Lilly shares trade for 49 times recent earnings, more than 12 times revenue and about 37 times book value (corporate net worth per share). I think the stock, which has soared on the success of weight-loss drugs, is near-perfectly priced. Growth has slowed to a crawl at United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), partly because of competition from Amazon.com. UPS shares have fallen more than 31% this year. The stock traded at well above $200 in 2021 but now languishes at about $84. Despite all this bad news, Carol Tome, the company’s CEO, spent just over $1 million last month to add to her UPS holdings. Two directors also bought shares in July and August. I think Tome will be rewarded. UPS has a standout return on equity, more than 34%. And the stock trades for less than 13 times earnings. At First Citizens BancShares Inc. (FCNCA), the chief executive Frank Holding Jr. spent just over $1 million last month to add to his considerable hoard of shares. Four other insiders also bought shares in August. Based in Raleigh, N.C., First Citizens is a regional bank with improving profits. I like to see banks earn a return on assets of 1.0% or better. First Citizens has cleared that hurdle in six of the past seven years. The stock looks pretty reasonable to me at 12 times recent earnings. This is the 75th column I’ve written about stocks with insider buying or selling. I can calculate results for 65 of them – all those written from 1999 through a year ago. Bad news first: Stocks I’ve recommended based on insider buying have returned an average of 8.9% in 12 months, trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index over the same periods by 1.8 percentage points. Better news: Stocks I said to avoid, even though insiders were buying, have trailed the index by 24 percentage points. Stocks where I discussed sales by insiders have lagged the index by 2.3 percentage points. Stocks where I noted insider buying but made no comment, or an ambiguous comment, have beaten the index by 14.2 percentage points. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I own put options on Eli Lilly, betting on a decline.

Title: The world's 3 richest people are worth a combined $1 trillion — about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway

The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Larry Ellison, a cofounder of Oracle, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, had net worths of $429 billion, $360 billion, and $269 billion as of Monday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart. It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has about a 13% stake in Meta. The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by about $4 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $167 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 80% since January 1. Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $61 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 30% gain in 2025. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances. Jump to

Title: Tesla stock is rising. Why Elon Musk is a ‘wartime’ CEO.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Tesla stock was rising in premarket trading Monday as CEO Elon Musk gets ready for an artificial intelligence “war." Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were up 1.2% at $400.61 in early trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each rising about 0.2%. The move comes after the stock rallied 13% this past week. Exactly why it rose that much is open for some debate. Technical traders became excited by the recent momentum that took Tesla past the highs reached in the Spring. EV sales were strong in August, according to industry data providers. Buyers appear to be rushing to beat the removal of the $7,500 federal EV purchase tax credit, which goes away at the end of September. Tesla has also received some approvals to begin testing its self-driving taxi service in Las Vegas. Tesla launched a small AI-trained robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes AI is what has investors excited. “Investors are starting to see through the near-term demand issues for Tesla and recognize that Tesla is in a pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity, with Robotaxis set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the US over the next year," he wrote on Sunday. Tesla sold about 721,000 cars in the first half of 2025, down about 13% year over year. That’s the demand weakness to which Ives is referring. Selling fewer cars isn’t good news, but AI simply matters more than car sales these days. “We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla in its history as a company," added Ives. He calls AI a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. “Musk is driving this [AI] vision and is now in a ‘wartime CEO’ mode, which is music to the ears of Tesla bulls with this AI Arms Race happening across the tech world." The arms race might be an apt analogy. AI is driving the stock market with Magnificent Seven stocks valued at some $20 trillion. ChatGPT parent OpenAI is valued at about $500 billion, while Amazon.com, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on AI computing. Some of that is for self-driving cars, Tesla’s territory. Amazon owns self-driving company Zoox. Alphabet controls Waymo. Ives says Musk is the right leader for Tesla at a time like this, calling him the company’s “most important asset." A new pay package, worth up to $1 trillion if all performance incentives are hit, should keep Musk at Tesla until 2030 and beyond. Ives is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy with a $500 price target for shares, the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. The rest of the Street isn’t as bullish. The average analyst price target is about $318 a share, and 44% of analysts rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 2% so far this year, and up about 72% over the past 12 months.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/sp-500-set-to-surge-30/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:48Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In what's shaping up to be a pivotal week for global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet on September 16-17. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While that’s the prevailing expectation, the Fed has a history of surprising markets. If they cut rates by 50 basis points instead of 25, it would be an unexpected move. Looking at past events, such surprises can serve as powerful catalysts for major market rallies. Our analysis shows that a move like this could potentially boost the market by 30%. That said, for investors looking for growth potential with lower exposure to the volatility of individual equities, consider the High Quality Portfolio. Since its inception, this portfolio has built a strong track record, consistently outperforming its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with cumulative returns exceeding 91%. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Recent history shows how impactful unexpected Fed moves can be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the Fed made two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 totaling 150 basis points. The first was a 50 basis point cut on March 3rd, followed by an even larger 100 basis point cut on March 15th that brought rates to near-zero. While markets initially dropped to around 2,237 on March 23, 2020, the aggressive action helped stabilize confidence. This sparked a massive rally, with the S&P 500 climbing to around 4,797 by January 2022—a gain of about 115% in under two years. Similarly, the 2019 rate cut cycle demonstrated the power of surprise. Beginning in July 2019, the Fed made three 25 basis point cuts, some of which were partly unexpected. These came after a period of rate hikes and helped fuel a major rally. From its low of about 2,346 in December 2018, the S&P 500 surged to around 3,393 by February 2020, a 45% gain in just 14 months. These examples show a clear pattern: when the Fed acts more aggressively than expected, it can ignite strong, sustained rallies. The current market setup is unique. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs around 6,584, unlike past rate-cut cycles, which often came during economic crises. The market has already priced in a 25 basis point cut, so a bigger move would be a major surprise. Adding complexity is political pressure from the Trump administration for deeper rate cuts. This could influence the Fed’s decision and the market’s response. Based on historical trends, the size of a surprise cut correlates directly with the rally potential. For perspective, the 45% rally starting in 2019 followed a total of 75 basis points in cuts, while the 115% rally from 2020 came after 150 basis points in emergency cuts. So a 50 basis point cut likely wouldn’t drive a rally on that scale, but a 30% gain is a realistic possibility. History shows that surprises can be powerful catalysts. There are compelling reasons for the Fed to go for an aggressive 50 basis point cut. The biggest is the element of surprise—since markets don’t expect it, such a move would be a strong signal. Lower rates also add liquidity, fueling growth and supporting multiple expansion as investors pay more for earnings. There’s also political pressure from the Trump administration, which could hint at more cuts to come. Of course, the Fed might do something else unexpected, like holding rates steady and maintaining its hawkish stance. That would likely hit markets hard. A lack of action could send the S&P 500 index down by as much as 8%. Inflation fears are real. See – Will Inflation Data Crush The S&P 500? – for more details. Even with the potential for a rally, there are key risks to consider. The upcoming Fed meeting is high stakes, and any deviation from the expected 25 basis point cut could spark big market moves. The consistent market swings after Fed meetings since 2019 highlight the importance of risk management. For instance, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 while avoiding much of this Fed-induced volatility, delivering cumulative returns of over 91% since inception—far better than broad market indices. A surprise 50-basis-point or larger Fed rate cut could still trigger a significant rally for the S&P 500, potentially 30% in the medium term based on historical precedent. However, the 2019 cycle offers a better comparison than the crisis-driven 2020 response, suggesting any rally would be more moderate but still substantial.

Title: Buy Sell Or Hold Credo Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/buy-sell-or-hold-credo-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Credo Technology stock (NASDAQ:CRDO) surged nearly 10% on Wednesday and has more than doubled over the past quarter, elevating its market capitalization to approximately $28 billion. The firm offers high-speed connectivity solutions for Ethernet and AI infrastructure, including integrated circuits, active electrical cables, and IP licensing. This recent stock surge follows a spectacular first-quarter report, which ended on August 2, 2025, showing revenues soaring 274% year-over-year to $223.1 million. Credo also introduced its Bluebird Digital Signal Processor, a low-power, high-efficiency solution designed to reduce latency and power consumption in GPU communications – a known bottleneck for scaling next-generation AI workloads. The company also highlighted significant business achievements with hyperscalers, who play a crucial role in the AI rollout. So, is Credo stock still a worthwhile investment after the substantial rally, or is it too late? The AI narrative is pivotal to Credo’s expansion. The Bluebird DSP directly addresses power and efficiency issues in optical transceivers, essential for data centers powering generative AI. In Q1 FY’26, three hyperscalers each accounted for over 10% of revenue, with a fourth beginning to increase its collaboration with the company. Management anticipates these four will remain primary contributors through fiscal 2026, while two additional hyperscalers are expected to join. This provides high visibility into future growth, with the company forecasting approximately 120% revenue growth in FY26, significantly surpassing earlier estimates of 85%. For context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) reported they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. If realized, this would establish Credo as a preferred supplier of AI infrastructure components during a time when cloud and chip industry leaders are rushing to expand their GPU clusters. This positions Credo as more than merely a chip supplier; it is emerging as a crucial enabler of hyperscaler AI developments. Naturally, investors must consider valuation. Credo is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 47.3x and a price-to-earnings multiple of 227x – substantial premiums compared to the S&P 500’s 3.3x and 24.2x, respectively. Yet, these elevated multiples indicate more than just hype. Revenues have increased by 176% in the past year to $600 million, with quarterly growth surpassing the S&P 500 by over 40 times. Profitability is also strong, with a 20.8% net margin compared to 12.6% for the broader index, and the balance sheet remains robust, with only $16 million in debt against $480 million in cash. Therefore, overall, Credo is not a speculative cash-burning AI venture, but a profitable, cash-generating growth enterprise with minimal leverage. So, is it too late to invest? That ultimately depends on your risk tolerance. For investors focused on value, Credo certainly appears costly, and its history of dramatic fluctuations – including a 62% drop during the inflation crisis of 2022 – underscores the risks involved. However, for growth-oriented investors, the narrative is significantly more enticing. Credo is addressing one of the largest bottlenecks in AI data centers — power and latency — while strengthening its partnerships with hyperscalers who are central to the AI expansion. If adoption continues at the current rate, the current high multiples may well be justified by the company’s exceptional growth potential. In this regard, Credo stands out as a high-risk but potentially high-reward investment in the infrastructure sector of the AI revolution. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices. What accounts for this? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index, experiencing less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

BDA Partners has cut some investment bankers in Shanghai to cope with intensifying competition in China and uncertainty over deals, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest financial services firm to retreat from the world’s second-biggest economy. Five Shanghai-based investment bankers have been let go by the boutique firm, which focuses on mergers and acquisitions, and a couple have relocated to BDA’s Hong Kong office, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Three senior bankers are staying in Shanghai to work on existing mandates and originating new deals, the people said. BDA may also consider moving to a smaller office to cut costs, although no final decisions have been made, the people said. Founded in 1996 with offices in New York and Singapore, BDA provides Asia-focused M&A advice to global clients, mostly on small-to-mid-sized transactions, its website shows. It also has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as London. “BDA has been in China since 1999 and we remain strongly committed to M&A across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan,” Simon Kavanagh, BDA’s head of Greater China, wrote in an emailed response to a query from Bloomberg News. “We continue active coverage of China, including having senior bankers on the ground in Hong Kong and the PRC.” While the volume of deals involving Chinese firms has grown this year, there are still plenty of challenges for advisers. They include a tightening of inbound investment, wide valuation gaps between buyers and sellers, cutthroat competition that is squeezing fees, and difficulty in getting deals finished because of geopolitical and regulatory tensions, such as with tariffs. Other investment banks, law firms and investment managers have also downsized in China. Prominent Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shuttered its Shanghai office last year and laid off staff. Fidelity International also planned to cut jobs in China, while Vanguard Group Inc., Van Eck Associates Corp. and Matthews International Capital Management LLC retreated too. Meanwhile, private equity firm Permira is overhauling its Asia strategy, closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai and shuffling senior leadership to India, where it sees stronger momentum and a more robust pipeline for deals, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Other alternative asset managers from KKR & Co. to Blackstone Inc. are also ramping up investments in India and elevating locally based executives to key regional roles. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: ROSEN, NATIONAL INVESTOR RIGHTS COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 14, 2025 14:45 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Bitcoin – Not Big Tech – Is The Market’s Biggest Story, Michael Saylor Says

Strategy’s stock and treasury moves have grabbed fresh attention after the company’s executive chairman compared the firm’s returns to those of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants. Short and blunt: Strategy has leaned hard into Bitcoin, and recent numbers make a striking case. According to posts by Michael Saylor, Strategy now holds about 638,460 BTC following a purchase of 1,955 BTC at an average price near 111,196. The company has spent roughly $47 billion, fees included, to build that stack at an average buy price of $73,880. Based on reports, the current value of those holdings is about $71 billion. Those figures sit at the center of Saylor’s argument that his firm’s balance sheet strategy has paid off in ways typical tech plays have not. Saylor also shared a chart that matched open interest against market capitalization. Strategy topped that metric at 100%, while Tesla registered 26%. The rest of the Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — came in well below Strategy’s reading. According to his post, this comparison underpins the claim that Strategy’s market dynamics tied to Bitcoin have outpaced many heavyweight tech names. What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7? pic.twitter.com/wywaAij3Rs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 13, 2025 Based on reports, each of those big tech firms is dealing with different pressures. Apple and Microsoft face tougher regulatory checks. Amazon is seeing slower consumer demand. Tesla must contend with rising competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a strong performer because of AI chip demand, but even Nvidia’s run this year has not matched its earlier explosive gains. Annualized returns presented by Saylor put Strategy at 91%, Nvidia at 72%, Tesla at 32%, Alphabet at 26%, and Meta at 23%. Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon showed significantly lower annualized gains in that comparison. Reports have disclosed that about 12 companies upped their Bitcoin holdings last week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC purchase. Gemini added 1,191 BTC and Bitdeer took on 333.5 BTC. Companies from Japan’s Metaplanet to China’s Cango and the US firm Volcon also added coins. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the 100 largest public holders now control 1,009,202 BTC, which is valued at more than $117 billion today. “What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7?” Saylor asked on X, hinting that Bitcoin—and his company’s bold treasury bet—may offer the answer. Whether investors see it as a challenge or a warning depends on how they weigh Bitcoin exposure against traditional tech growth.

Posted on September 14, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Compatibility with WooCommerce has now been expanded to Divi 5, giving you full control over product pages without relying on WooCommerce’s built-in templates. The newly-integrated WooCommerce Product Modules let you design engaging, user-friendly layouts that match your brand and help boost sales, while tapping into all of Divi 5’s features, including Flexbox, to build product pages with modern layout control. In this post, we’ll cover the modules’ key features and show you how to use them for your next Divi 5 ecommerce website. Let’s dive in. Woo Product Modules are specialized content elements within Divi 5, designed to customize product and category pages for Woo-powered stores. These modules replace the WooCommerce templates that come standard with the plugin, enabling you to create customizable layouts. Unlike these traditional templates, Divi 5’s modules allow creative freedom while maintaining compatibility with WooCommerce’s core functionality. The release of 17 WooCommerce Modules in Divi 5 marks a significant milestone. These modules, which cover all product and category page design aspects, are no longer in legacy mode, meaning they are all fully optimized for Divi 5’s modern architecture. With this transition to a more efficient foundation, Divi 5 performs better, is more scalable, and is compatible with the future of WordPress. The remaining 8 Woo Modules, focused on cart and checkout pages, are expected to roll out soon. Let’s go over the key features that you can expect now that the WooCommerce Product Modules have been integrated into Divi 5. The first batch of Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules includes tools designed to handle a specific aspect of product and category page design. These modules are: Together, these modules provide everything you need to build product and category pages, from navigational breadcrumbs to dynamic product displays. Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules free users from the constraints of standard WooCommerce Templates. With these modules, you can fully control your product pages’ layout, structure, and design, creating unique experiences. The modules support dynamic content, meaning they pull product data directly from WooCommerce, ensuring real-time updates for prices, stock levels, and descriptions. This allows you to build pages that drive engagement and conversions without requiring third-party plugins or custom code. Each module has extensive design settings, all manageable within the Visual Builder. You can customize elements like product galleries, sale badges, buttons, and more with options for typography, colors, spacing, and animations. For example, you can adjust the layout of the Woo Product Gallery module to display images in a slider or grid, style the Woo Product Add to Cart button with custom colors and hover effects, or tweak the Woo Product Rating module to align star ratings perfectly with your design. These settings let you create cohesive, branded store pages with ease. Divi 5’s Theme Builder lets you embrace the full potential of WooCommerce Product Modules by allowing you to create global templates for product and category pages. With Theme Builder, you can design a single template that applies to all of the products and categories in your store, ensuring a consistent, cohesive look. The Divi 5 Loop Builder offers an alternative way to build dynamic Woo content. With Loop Builder, you can query WooCommerce products and design flexible product loops using any Divi element, creating layouts, lists, and carousels that go beyond the fixed structure of dedicated product modules. For single-product layouts, use the Woo Product Modules; for product collections and archives, use the Loop Builder. This section will walk you through creating a product page in Divi 5’s Theme Builder using the new WooCommerce Product Modules. Navigate to Divi > Theme Builder in the WordPress dashboard. Click on + Add New Template. Click Build New Template when the dialog box appears. Next, we’ll need to assign our template to our products. Under Products, select All Products to assign the template. Click Create Template to assign it. Click Add Custom Body. This will allow us to build the body of our product page template. Choose Build Custom Body when the dialog box appears. When the Theme Builder launches, you can build a template from scratch, choose a premade layout, or build with AI. We’ll select Build From Scratch for this tutorial. Click the green + icon to add a new row. When the options appear, choose the two-column row. New rows you add to any Divi 5 page or template will use Flebox by default. Divi 5’s Flexbox Layout System gives you more control over how your product pages look than ever, including changing how your WooCommerce Product Modules stack across different screen sizes. Scroll down to reveal the Woo Product Modules option. Once clicked, you’ll have 17 Divi 5 Woo modules and 8 legacy (Divi 4) modules. Find and select the Woo Product Images module and add it to the first column. This Post is selected by default in the Product field in the Content tab. If you’d like to build the template using an existing product, choose it from the dropdown menu. This is a great way to preview how your template will look while creating it. Remember to swap it back to This Post before the final save. Expand the Elements dropdown menu to reveal the settings. Here, you can control which images display in the module, including the featured image, gallery images, and sale badge. Click the Image dropdown menu in the Design tab to reveal the settings. Here, you can force the image to occupy all the available space (force fullwidth), add a border, box shadow, adjust spacing, or add filters. You can also style the Sale Badge by assigning a background color, text, borders, and more. In the 2nd column, click Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Title module. Use the dropdown menu in the Product field of the Content tab to select a product and preview how it will look in the template. Next, navigate to the module’s Design tab and expand the Title Text dropdown menu. Here, you can assign a font and style the heading as you’d like. Under the product title, click to add a new module. Select the Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Price Module. In the Design tab, you can style every aspect of the product’s price, including the text, sale text, new price text, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Rating Module under the Woo Price Module. In the Content tab under Elements, you can choose to show or hide the star rating and customer reviews count. In the Design tab, the Layout dropdown menu lets you choose how to display the star rating. Elements can be displayed inline or stacked. Other styling options include assigning a color, text size, and letter spacing for the stars and styling options for the rating text. Under the Woo Star Rating Module, click to add a new Woo Module. This time, we’ll select the Woo Product Description Module. In the Content tab, choose which description to display (description or short description). In the Design tab, you can style the description with options for font, weight, style, alignment, color, size, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Add to Cart Module. It will allow your customers to add the product to their carts and choose any variations assigned to the product. The Elements toggles in the Content tab allow you to show or hide the quantity field and available stock. Quick note: For the stock quantity to display, you must check manage stock in the Woo product itself. You can style the field labels, text, dropdown menus (for variations), and the button to match your branding in the Design tab. Continue adding modules, like the Woo Product Meta Module to display SKU numbers and categories. You can also add the Woo Product Tabs Module to display a description, reviews, and additional info about your product. For maximum reach, you can display a series of Related Products on your product template to encourage your site’s visitors to explore additional products in your store, increasing the chance of a conversion. Once finished adding modules, make any additional changes you need, and then save the template by clicking on the Save button at the top right corner of the Theme Builder. Next, click the Exit button to return to the Theme Builder dashboard. Back in the Theme Builder dashboard, click Save Changes to save the template and apply it to your Woo products. As you can see, creating a product template with Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules is a simple process. We won’t cover all modules in this tutorial, but using all of them, you can create impressive product or category pages that keep your visitors engaged.

The second batch of WooCommerce Modules, focusing on cart and checkout pages, will be released in the next few weeks, wrapping up the integration with WooCommerce. These additions will enable users to fully customize the entire ecommerce funnel, from product browsing to checkout. The Divi 5 Public Beta will refine these features further, incorporating user feedback and additional bug fixes to ensure stability. Beyond WooCommerce compatibility and integration, Divi 5 continues to evolve with recent features like the Group Carousel Module for creating dynamic product sliders, the Lottie Module for adding lightweight animations, and a new Flexbox Layout System for enhanced layout control. These additions complement the Woo modules, offering even more creative possibilities for ecommerce sites. Divi 5‘s Woo Product Modules allow you to create captivating product and category pages with unparalleled flexibility and creativity. The modules offer a blend of creative freedom, dynamic content integration, and performance, all within an intuitive interface.

India's CSR regime, a significant source of social funding, has primarily focused on education, health, and rural development. However, it overlooks policy research, crucial for achieving true self-reliance. Increased CSR investment in think tanks and R&D could boost innovation, competitiveness, and effective governance, strengthening India's intellectual sovereignty and supporting national priorities.

Title: TSM-Bee? TSMC gets into the honey business after working with local beekeepers to establish hives around its fabs
URL: https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsm-bee-tsmc-gets-into-the-honey-business-after-working-with-local-beekeepers-to-establish-hives-around-its-fabs

TSMC branded honey is available in several flavors, depending on the flora around a particular fab. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TSMC has worked with local beekeepers in Taiwan to produce ‘Ji Mi’ – TSMC branded honey. The production of this golden, viscous, and culinary important liquid has become possible around the world’s largest contract chipmaker fabs in Taiwan thanks to extensive environmental and sustainability efforts by the company. Sources: Liberty Times and Mirror Daily (machine translated). On Friday, TSMC presented at the ‘2025 Asia Pacific Sustainability Expo - Co-Prosperity x Growth Forum.’ At the event, its SVP of Corporate Sustainability, Ho Li-mei, claimed TSMC's commitment to ecological integration has reaped very worthwhile, and some surprising, dividends. The prime example, as per our headline, is that bees have returned to the local ecosystem around TSMC’s massive manufacturing facilities. Bees came naturally after the restoration of plant species chosen for their suitability, after environmental surveys. Now TSMC is collaborating with local beekeepers and Tunghai University to produce TSMC-exclusive honey – ‘Ji Mi.’ Other signs that nature’s balance has been restored around TSMC fabs are the return of native Taiwanese species like the silver goby in waters around the plants. It is also claimed that TSMC is the first semiconductor producer in Taiwan to have fireflies living on the site. Fireflies are notoriously fussy about the environments they inhabit in Taiwan. Tom’s Hardware regulars will be aware of TSMC’s previous concerns about water supplies. This resource pressure, and the need for TSMC to be particularly eco-friendly, given Taiwan’s rather small size, may have been instrumental to the surprising eco-dividends we are now seeing around its fabs. At the Expo, Ho Li-mei mentioned that TSMC has made major inroads in managing precious resources in the water-intensive semiconductor industry. Thanks to specialized resource management, water recycling at new facilities has been increased to over 90%, it is claimed. As resources are carefully conserved, semiconductor manufacturing waste is being reduced to the minimum. The source reports note that TSMC's waste recycling rate is as high as 97%, and less than 1% of waste in Taiwan is landfilled. Moreover, a modern ‘Zero Waste Center’ in Taichung has been successful at converting waste into electronic-grade raw materials – advancing the circular economy.

Gains were driven by new submarine orders, a 15-year MoD modernisation roadmap, and strong order books. Analysts see long-term potential but caution that near-term upside may be limited by valuations and execution capacity.

Think of the railroad, the Bessemer process, electric power, the internal combustion engine, or the microprocessor—each of which, like a stray spark in a fireworks factory, set off decades of follow-on innovations, permeated every part of society, and catapulted a new set of inventors and investors into power, influence, and wealth. Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running. Anyone who invests in the new new thing must answer two questions: First, how much value will this innovation create? And second, who will capture it? Information and communication technology (ICT) was a revolution whose value was captured by startups and led to thousands of newly rich founders, employees, and investors. In contrast, shipping containerization was a revolution whose value was spread so thin that in the end, it made only a single founder temporarily rich and only a single investor a little bit richer. Is generative AI more like the former or the latter? Will it be the basis of many future industrial fortunes, or a net loser for the investment community as a whole, with a few zero-sum winners here and there? There are ways to make money investing in the fruits of AI, but they will depend on assuming the latter—that it is once again a less propitious time for inventors and investors, that AI model builders and application companies will eventually compete each other into an oligopoly, and that the gains from AI will accrue not to its builders but to customers. A lot of the money pouring into AI is therefore being invested in the wrong places, and aside from a couple of lucky early investors, those who make money will be the ones with the foresight to get out early. The microprocessor was revolutionary, but the people who invented it at Intel in 1971 did not see it that way—they just wanted to avoid designing desktop calculator chipsets from scratch every time. But outsiders realized they could use the microprocessor to build their own personal computers, and enthusiasts did. Thousands of tinkerers found configurations and uses that Intel never dreamed of. This distributed and permissionless invention kicked off a “great surge of development,” as the economist Carlota Perez calls it, triggered by technology but driven by economic and societal forces.[1] There was no real demand for personal computers in the early 1970s; they were expensive toys. But the experimenters laid the technical groundwork and built a community. Then, around 1975, a step-change in the cost of microprocessors made the personal computer market viable. The Intel 8080 had an initial list price of $360 ($2,300 in today’s dollars). MITS could barely turn a profit on its Altair at a bulk price of $75 each ($490 today). But when MOS Technologies started selling its 6502 for $25 ($150 today), Steve Wozniak could afford to build a prototype Apple. The 6502 and the similarly priced Zilog Z80 forced Intel’s prices down. The nascent PC community started spawning entrepreneurs and a score of companies appeared, each with a slightly different product. You couldn’t have known in the mid-1970s that the PC (and PC-like products, such as ATMs, POS terminals, smartphones, etc.) would revolutionize everything. While Steve Jobs was telling investors that every household would someday have a personal computer (a wild underestimate, as it turned out), others questioned the need for personal computers at all. As late as 1979, Apple’s ads didn’t tell you what a personal computer could do—it asked what you did with it.[2] The established computer manufacturers (IBM, HP, DEC) had no interest in a product their customers weren’t asking for. Nobody “needed” a computer, and so PCs weren’t bought—they were sold. Flashy startups like Apple and Sinclair used hype to get noticed, while companies with footholds in consumer electronics like Atari, Commodore, and Tandy/RadioShack used strong retail connections to put their PCs in front of potential customers. The market grew slowly at first, accelerating only as experiments led to practical applications like the spreadsheet, introduced in 1979. As use grew, observation of use caused a reduction in uncertainty, leading to more adoption in a self-reinforcing cycle. This kind of gathering momentum takes time in every technological wave: It took almost 30 years for electricity to reach half of American households, for example, and it took about the same amount of time for personal computers.[3] When a technological revolution changes everything, it takes a huge amount of innovation, investment, storytelling, time, and plain old work. It also sucks up all the money and talent available. Like Kuhn’s paradigms in science, any technology not part of the wave’s techno-economic paradigm will seem like a sideshow.[4] Source: [3] The nascent growth of PCs attracted investors—venture capitalists—who started making risky bets on new companies. This development incentivized more inventors, entrepreneurs, and researchers, which in turn drew in more speculative capital. Companies like IBM, the computing behemoth before the PC, saw poor relative performance. They didn’t believe the PC could survive long enough to become capable in their market and didn’t care about new, small markets that wanted a cheaper solution. Retroactively, we give the PC pioneers the powers of prophets rather than visionaries. But at the time, nobody outside of a small group of early adopters paid any attention. Establishment media like The New York Times didn’t take the PC seriously until after IBM’s was introduced in August 1981. In the entire year of 1976, when Apple Computer was founded, the NYT mentioned PCs only four times.[5] Apparently, only the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, and the troublemakers were paying attention. Source: [5] It’s the element of surprise that should strike us most forcefully when we compare the early days of the computer revolution to today. No one took note of personal computers in the 1970s. In 2025, AI is all we seem to talk about. Big companies hate surprises. That’s why uncertainty makes a perfect moat for startups. Apple would never have survived IBM entering the market in 1979, and only lived to compete another day after raising $100 million in its 1980 IPO. It was the only remaining competitor after the IBM-induced winnowing.[6] Source: [6] As the tech took hold and started to show promise, innovations in software, memory, and peripherals like floppy disk drives and modems joined it. They reinforced one another, with each advance putting pressure on the technologies adjacent to it. When any part of the system held back the other parts, investors rushed to fund that sector. As increases in PC memory allowed more complicated software, for example, there became a need for more external storage, which caused VC Dave Marquardt to invest in disk drive manufacturer Seagate in 1980. Seagate gave Marquardt a 40x return when it went public in 1981. Other investors noticed, and some $270 million was plowed into the industry in the following three years.[7] Money also poured into the underlying infrastructure—fiber optic networks, chip making, etc.—so that capacity was never a bottleneck. Companies which used the new technological system to outperform incumbents began to take market share, and even staid competitors realized they needed to adopt the new thing or die. The hype became a froth which became an investment bubble: the dot-com frenzy of the late 1990s. The ICT wave was therefore similar to previous ones—like the investment mania of the 1830s and the Roaring ‘20s, which followed the infrastructure buildout of canals and railways, respectively—in which the human response to each stage predictably generated the next. When the dot-com bubble popped, society found it disapproved of the excesses in the sector and governments found they had the popular support to reassert authority over the tech companies and their investors. This put a brake on the madness. Instead of the reckless innovation of the bubble, companies started to expand into proven markets, and financiers moved from speculating to investing. Entrepreneurs began to focus on finding applications rather than on innovating the underlying technologies. Technological improvements continued, but change became more evolutionary than revolutionary. As change slowed, companies gained the confidence to invest for the longer term. They began to combine various parts of the system in new ways to create value for a wider group of users. The massive overbuilding of fiber optic telecom networks and other infrastructure during the frenzy left plenty of cheap capacity, keeping the costs of expansion down. It was a great time to be a businessperson and investor. In contrast, society did not need a bubble to pop to start excoriating AI. Given that the backlash to tech has been going on for a decade, this seems normal to us. But the AI backlash differs from the general high regard, earlier in the cycle, enjoyed by the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and others who built big tech businesses. The world hates change, and only gave tech a pass in the ‘80s and ‘90s because it all still seemed reversible: it could be made to go away if it turned out badly. This gave the early computer innovators some leeway to experiment. Now that everyone knows computers are here to stay, AI is not allowed the same wait-and-see attitude. It is seen as part of the ICT revolution. Perez, the economist, breaks each technological wave into four predictable phases: irruption, frenzy, synergy, and maturity. Each has a characteristic investment profile. The middle two, frenzy and synergy, are the easy ones for investors. Frenzy is when everyone piles in and investors are rewarded for taking big risks on unproven ideas, culminating in the bubble, when paper profits disappear. When rationality returns, the synergy phase begins, as companies make their products usable and productive for a wide array of users. Synergy pays those who are patient, picky, and can bring more than just money to the table. Irruption and maturity are more difficult to invest in. Investing in the 1970s was harder than it might look in hindsight. To invest from 1971 through 1975, you had to be either a true believer or a conglomerator with a knuckle-headed diversification strategy. Intel was a great investment, though it looked at first like a previous-wave electronics company. MOS Technologies was founded in 1969 to compete with Texas Instruments but sold a majority of itself to Allen-Bradley to stay afloat. Zilog was funded in 1975 by Exxon (Exxon!). Apple was a great investment, but it had none of the hallmarks of what VCs look for, as the PC was still a solution in search of a problem. It was later irruption, in the early 1980s, when great opportunities proliferated: PC makers (Compaq, Dell), software and operating systems (Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Adobe), peripherals (Seagate), workstations (Sun), and computer stores (Businessland), among others. If you invested in the winners, you did well. But there was still more money than ideas, which meant that it was no golden age for investing. By 1983, there were more than 70 companies competing in the disk drive sector alone, and valuations collapsed. There were plenty of people whose fortunes were established in the 1970s and 1980s, and many VCs made their names in that era. But the biggest advantage to being an irruption-stage investor was building institutional knowledge to invest early and well in the frenzy and synergy phases. Investing in the maturity phase is even more difficult. In irruption, it’s hard to see what will happen; in maturity, nothing much happens at all. The uncertainty about what will work and how customers and society will react is almost gone. Things are predictable, and everyone acts predictably. The lack of dynamism allows the successful synergy companies to remain entrenched (see: the Nifty 50 and FAANG), but growth becomes harder. They start to enter each other’s markets, conglomerate, raise prices, and cut costs. The era of products priced to entice new customers ends, and quality suffers. The big companies continue to embrace the idea of revolutionary innovation, but feel the need to control how their advances are used. R&D spending is redirected from product and process innovation toward increasingly fruitless attempts to find ways to extend the current paradigm. Companies frame this as a drive to win, but it’s really a fear of losing. Innovation can happen during maturity, sometimes spectacularly. But because these innovations only find support if they fit into the current wave’s paradigm, they are easily captured in the dominant companies’ gravity wells. This means making money as an entrepreneur or investor in them is almost impossible. Generative AI is clearly being captured by the dominant ICT companies, which raises the question of whether this time will be different for inventors and investors—a different question from whether AI itself is a revolutionary technology. Shipping containerization was a late-wave innovation that changed the world, kicked off our modern era of globalization, resulted in profound changes to society and the economy, and contributed to rapid growth in well-being. But there were, perhaps, only one or two people who made real money investing in it. The year 1956 was late in the previous wave. But that year, the company soon to be known as SeaLand revolutionized freight shipping with the launch of the first containership, the Ideal-X. SeaLand’s founder, Malcom McLean, had an epiphany that the job to be done by truckers, railroads, and shipping lines was to move goods from shipper to destination, not to drive trucks, fill boxcars, or lade boats. SeaLand allowed freight to transfer seamlessly from one mode to another, saving time, making shipping more predictable, and cutting costs—both the costs of loading, unloading, and reloading, and the cost of a ship sitting idly in port as it was loaded and unloaded.[8] The benefits of containerization, if it could be made to happen, were obvious. Everybody could see the efficiencies, and customers don’t care how something gets to where they can buy it, as long as it does. But longshoremen would lose work, politicians would lose the votes of those who lost work, port authorities would lose the support of the politicians, federal regulators would be blamed for adverse consequences, railroads might lose freight to shipping lines, shipping lines might lose freight to new shipping lines, and it would all cost a mint. Most thought McLean would never be able to make it work. McLean squeezed through the cracks of the opposition he faced. He bought and retrofitted war surplus ships, lowering costs. He went after the coastal shipping trade, a dying business in the age of the new interstates, to avoid competition. He set up shop in Newark, NJ, rather than the shipping hub of Hell’s Kitchen, to get buy-in from the port authority and avoid Manhattan congestion. And he made a deal with the New York longshoremen’s union, which was only possible because he was a small player whom they figured was not a threat. Source: [10] But competitors and regulators moved too quickly for McLean to seize the few barriers to entry that might have been available to him: domination of the ports, exclusive agreements with shippers or other forms of transportation, standardization on proprietary technology, etc.[9] When it started to look like it might work, around 1965, the obvious advantages of containerization meant that every large shipping line entered the business, and competition took off. Even though containerized freight was less than 1% of total trade by 1968, the number of containerships was already ramping fast.[10] Capacity outstripped demand for years. The increase in competition led to a rate war, which led to squeezed profits, which in turn led to consolidation and cartels. Meanwhile, the cost of building ever-larger container ships and the port facilities to deal with them meant the business became hugely capital intensive. McLean saw the writing on the wall and sold SeaLand to R.J. Reynolds in January 1969. He was, perhaps, the only entrepreneur to get out unscathed. It took a long time for the end-to-end vision to be realized. But around 1980, a dramatic drop began in the cost of sea freight.[11] This contributed to a boom in international trade[12] and allowed manufacturers to move away from higher-wage to lower-wage countries, making containerization irreversible. Source: [11] Some people did make money, of course; someone always does. McLean did, as did shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig, who had invested $8.5 million in SeaLand’s predecessor, McLean Industries, at $8.50 per share in 1965 and sold in 1969 for $50 per share.[13] Shipbuilders made money, too: between 1967 and 1972, some $10 billion ($80 billion in 2025 dollars) was spent building containerships. The contractors that built the new container ports also made money. And, later, shipping lines that consolidated and dominated the business, like Maersk and Evergreen, became very large. But, “for R.J. Reynolds, and for other companies that had chased fast growth by buying into container shipping in the late 1960s, their investments brought little but disappointment.”[14] Aside from McLean and Ludwig, it is hard to find anyone who became rich from containerization itself, because competition and capex costs made it hard to grow fast or achieve high margins. Source: [12] The business ended up being dominated primarily by the previous incumbents, and the margins went to the companies shipping goods, not the ones they shipped through. Companies like IKEA benefited from cheap shipping, going from a provincial Scandinavian company in 1972 to the world’s largest furniture retailer by 2008; container shipping was a perfect fit for IKEA’s flat-pack furniture. Others, like Walmart, used the predictability enabled by containerization to lower inventory and its associated costs. With hindsight, it’s easy to see how you could have invested in containerization: not in the container shipping industry itself, but in the industries that benefited from containerization. But even here, the success of companies like Walmart, Costco, and Target was coupled with the failure of others. The fallout from containerization set Sears and Woolworth on downward spirals, put the final nail in the coffin of Montgomery Ward and A&P, and drove Macy’s into bankruptcy before it was rescued and downsized by Federated. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, “the furniture capital of the world,” furniture makers tried to compete with IKEA by importing cheap pieces from China. They ended up being replaced by their suppliers.[15] If there had been more time to build moats, there might have been a few dominant containerization companies, and the people behind them would be at the top of the Forbes 400, while their investors would be legendary. But moats take time to build and, unlike the personal computer, the adoption of containerization wasn’t a surprise—every business with interests at stake had a strategic plan immediately. The economist Joseph Schumpeter said “perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced.”[16] But containerization shows this isn’t true at the end of tech waves. And because there is no economic profit during perfect competition, there is no money to be made by innovators during maturity. Like containerization, the introduction of AI did not lead to a period of protected profits for its innovators. It led to an immediate competitive free-for-all. Let’s grant that generative AI is revolutionary (but also that, as is becoming increasingly clear, this particular tech is now already in an evolutionary stage). It will create a lot of value for the economy, and investors hope to capture some of it. When, who, and how depends on whether AI is the end of the ICT wave, or the beginning of a new one. If AI had started a new wave, there would have been an extended period of uncertainty and experimentation. There would have been a population of early adopters experimenting with their own models. When thousands or millions of tinkerers use the tech to solve problems in entirely new ways, its uses proliferate. But because they are using models owned by the big AI companies, their ability to fully experiment is limited to what’s allowed by the incumbents, who have no desire to permit an extended challenge to the status quo. This doesn’t mean AI can’t start the next technological revolution. It might, if experimentation becomes cheap, distributed and permissionless—like Wozniak cobbling together computers in his garage, Ford building his first internal combustion engine in his kitchen, or Trevithick building his high-pressure steam engine as soon as James Watt’s patents expired. When any would-be innovator can build and train an LLM on their laptop and put it to use in any way their imagination dictates, it might be the seed of the next big set of changes—something revolutionary rather than evolutionary. But until and unless that happens, there can be no irruption. AI is instead the epitome of the ICT wave. The computing visionaries of the 1960s set out to build a machine that could think, which their successors eventually did, by extending gains in algorithms, chips, data, and data center infrastructure. Like containerization, AI is an extension of something that came before, and therefore no one is surprised by what it can and will do. In the 1970s, it took time for people to wrap their heads around the desirability of powerful and ubiquitous computing. But in 2025, machines that think better than previous machines are easy for people to understand. Consider the extent to which the progress of AI rhymes with the business evolution of containerization: In the “AI rhymes” column, the first four items are already underway. How you should invest depends on whether you believe Nos. 5–7 are next. Economists are predicting that AI will increase global GDP somewhere between 1%[17] to more than 7%[18] over the next decade, which is $1–7 trillion of new value created. The big question is where that money will stick as it flows through the value chain. Most AI market overviews have a score or more categories, breaking each of them into customer and industry served. But these will change dramatically over the next few years. You could, instead, just follow the money to simplify the taxonomy of companies: What the history of containerization suggests is that, if you aren’t already an investor in a model company, you shouldn’t bother. Sam Altman and a few other early movers may make a fortune, as McLean and Ludwig did. But the huge costs of building and running a model, coupled with intense competition, means there will, in the end, be only a few companies, each funded and owned by the largest tech companies. If you’re already an investor, congratulations: There will be consolidation, so you might get an exit. Domain-specific models—like Cursor or Harvey—will be part of the consolidation. These are probably the most valuable models. But fine-tuning is relatively cheap, and there are big economies of scope. On the other hand, just as Google had to buy Invite Media in 2010 to figure out how to sell to ad agencies, domain-specific model companies that have earned the trust of their customers will be prime acquisition targets. And although it seems possible that models which generate things other than language—like Midjourney or Runway—might use their somewhat different architecture to carve out a separate technological path, the LLM companies have easily entered this space as well. Whether this applies to companies like Osmo remains to be seen. While it’s too late to invest in the model companies, the profusion of those using the models to solve specific problems is ongoing: Perplexity, InflectionAI, Writer, Abridge, and a hundred others. But if any of these become very valuable, the model companies will take their earnings, either through discriminatory pricing or vertical integration. Success, in other words, will mean defeat—always a bad thesis. At some point, model companies and app companies will converge: There will simply be AI companies, and only a few of them. There will be some winners, as always, but investments in the app layer as a whole will lose money. The same caveat applies, however: If an app company can build a customer base or an amazing team, it might be acquired. But these companies aren’t really technology companies at all; they are building a market on spec and have to be priced as such. A further caveat is that there will be investors who make a killing arbitraging FOMO-panicked acquirors willing to massively overpay. But this is not really “investing.” There might be an investment opportunity in companies that manage the interface between the AI giants and their customers, or protect company data from the model companies—like Hugging Face or Glean—because these businesses are by nature independent of the models. But no analogue in the post-containerization shipping market became very large. Even the successful intermediation companies in the AI space will likely end up mid-sized because the model companies will not allow them to gain strategic leverage—another consequence of the absence of surprise. When an industry is going to be big but there is uncertainty about how it will play out, it often makes sense to swim upstream to the industry’s suppliers. In the case of AI, this means the chip providers, data companies, and cloud/data center companies: SambaNova, Scale AI, and Lambda, as well as those that have been around for a long time, like Nvidia and Bloomberg. The case for data is mixed. General data—i.e., things most people know, including everything anyone knew more than, say, 10 years ago, and most of what was learned after that—is a commodity. There may be room for a few companies to do the grunt work of collating and tagging it, but since the collating and tagging might best be done by AI itself, there will not be a lot of pricing leverage. Domain-specific models will need specialist data, and other models will try to answer questions about the current moment. Specific, timely, and hard to reproduce data will be valuable. This is not a new market, of course—Bloomberg and others have done well by it. A more concentrated customer base will lower prices for this data, while wider use will raise revenues. On balance, this will probably be a plus for the industry, though not a huge one. There will be new companies built, but only a couple worth investing in. The high capex of AI companies will primarily be spent with the infrastructure companies. These companies are already valued with this expectation, so there won’t be an upside surprise. But consider that shipbuilding benefited from containerization from 1965 until demand collapsed after about 1973.[19] If AI companies consolidate or otherwise act in concert, even a slight downturn that forces them to conserve cash could turn into a serious, sudden, and long-lasting decline in infrastructure spending. This would leave companies like Nvidia and its emerging competitors—who must all make long-term commitments to suppliers and for capacity expansion—unable to lower costs to match the new, smaller market size. Companies priced for an s-curve are overpriced if there’s a peak and decline. Source: [19] All of which means that investors shouldn’t swim upstream, but fish downstream: companies whose products rely on achieving high-quality results from somewhat ambiguous information will see increased productivity and higher profits. These sectors include professional services, healthcare, education, financial services, and creative services, which together account for between a third and a half of global GDP and have not seen much increased productivity from automation. AI can help lower costs, but as with containerization, how individual businesses incorporate lower costs into their strategies—and what they decide to do with the savings—will determine success. To put it bluntly, using cost savings to increase profits rather than grow revenue is a loser’s game. The companies that will benefit most rapidly are those whose strategies are already conditional on lowering costs. IKEA’s longtime strategy was to sell quality furniture for low prices and make it up on volume. After containerization made it possible for them to go worldwide, IKEA became the world’s largest retailer and Ingvar Kamprad (the IK of IKEA) became a billionaire. Similarly, Walmart, whose strategy was high volume and low prices in underserved markets, benefited from both cost savings and just-in-time supply chains, allowing increased product variety and lower inventory costs. Today’s knowledge-work companies that already prioritize the same values are the least risky way to bet on AI, but new companies will form or re-form with a high-volume, low-cost strategy, just as Costco did in the early 1980s. New companies will compete with the incumbents, but with a clean slate and hindsight. Regardless, there are few barriers to entry, so each of these firms will face stiff competition and operate in fragmented markets. Experienced management and flawless execution will be key. Being an entrepreneur will be a fabulous proposition in these sectors. Being an investor will be harder. Companies will not need much private capital—IKEA never needed to raise risk capital, and Costco raised only one round in 1983 before going public in 1985—because implementing cost-savings technology is not capital intensive. As with containerization, there will be a long lag between technology trigger and the best investments. The opportunities will be later. Stock pickers will also make money, but they need to be choosy. At the high end of projections, an additional 7% in GDP growth over ten years within one third of the economy gives a tailwind of only about 2% per year to these companies—even less if productivity growth from older ICT products abates. The primary value shift will be to companies that are embracing the strategic implications of AI from companies that are not, the way Walmart benefited from Sears, which took advantage of cheaper goods prices but did not reinvent itself. Consumers, however, will be the biggest beneficiaries. Previous waves of mechanization benefited labor productivity in manufacturing, driving prices down and saving consumers money. But increased labor productivity in manufacturing also led to higher manufacturing wages. Wages in services businesses had to rise to compete, even though these businesses did not benefit from productivity gains. This caused the price of services to rise.[20] The share of household spending on food and clothing went from 55% in 1918 to 16% in 2023,[21] but the cost of knowledge-intensive services like healthcare and education have grown well above inflation. Something similar will happen with AI: Knowledge-intensive services will get cheaper, allowing consumers to buy more of them, while services that require person-to-person interaction will get more expensive, taking up a greater percentage of household spending. This points to obvious opportunities in both. But the big news is that most of the new value created by AI will be captured by consumers, who should see a wider variety of knowledge-intensive goods at reasonable prices, and wider and more affordable access to services like medical care, education, and advice. There is nothing better than the beginning of a new wave, when the opportunities to envision, invent, and build world-changing companies leads to money, fame, and glory. But there is nothing more dangerous for investors and entrepreneurs than wishful thinking. The lessons learned from investing in tech over the last 50 years are not the right ones to apply now. The way to invest in AI is to think through the implications of knowledge workers becoming more efficient, to imagine what markets this efficiency unlocks, and to invest in those. For decades, the way to make money was to bet on what the new thing was. Now, you have to bet on the opportunities it opens up.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Financial markets have already had an unusual year, but recent price action lately has been especially bizarre, according to Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a Substack post on Tuesday titled “Super weird markets since Jackson Hole,” he traced the path of key assets since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to rate cuts in a speech at the annual central bank symposium last month. “You’d have thought that would weigh on the Dollar, lift the S&P 500 and boost commodity prices across the board. But that hasn’t happened,” Brooks wrote. “The only thing that’s moved is gold, with a massive price rise of almost 10 percent.” To be sure, stocks have rallied since his post as benign inflation data cleared the way for Fed rate cuts when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices have also marched higher, setting fresh highs along the way and closing Friday at $3,680.70 per ounce. But the bond market has behaved more unexpectedly. Brooks noted the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall right after Powell’s speech but only turned lower after another bad jobs report was released two weeks later. “The fact that the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall immediately is weird and worrying,” he added. “It took very weak payrolls to finally do that.” In addition, while the dollar index has had some ups and downs, it has returned to about where it was before Powell’s speech, with Brooks calling that “counterintuitive” as expectations for Fed easing would typically bring it lower. Meanwhile, bitcoin sold off after Jackson Hole but is also back where it started, even though cryptocurrencies have generally acted like risk assets in the past and previously rallied on rate-cut hopes. “What does all this mean? Recent market moves suggest gold is the ultimate safe haven,” Brooks said. “Bitcoin is proving too volatile and speculative, so — as political pressure on the Fed mounts — markets gravitate to gold.” Fears of a debt crisis in France and the U.K. have jolted global bond yields higher in recent weeks. Political gridlock in France in particular has dimmed hopes that Paris will rein in deficits anytime soon. On Friday evening, Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating from AA- to A+, the lowest level ever for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, saying a major shift to fiscal discipline is unlikely. It’s possible the crisis in France sent more investors looking for a safe haven toward the dollar, potentially explaining why the greenback has been stable, Brooks said. After his post, other global events have stirred more geopolitical concerns that may also favor the dollar. Israel attacked Hamas leaders in Qatar, a close U.S. Mideast ally, sparking sharp backlash in the region and sending oil prices higher. And Russian drones entered Polish airspace, forcing NATO allies to activate air-defense systems and deploy fighters jets that shot down the aircraft. “The bottom line is that there’s a lot of things in markets that don’t currently hang together well at all,” Brooks said. The key question is whether the rise in gold prices is sign that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status, though he thinks it’s just temporary noise and sees a reversion to the mean eventually. In a note on Tuesday, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also noticed the odd market moves that have been going on. But he said “the tell” is the dollar’s 10% decline year to date against other global currencies, which stems from President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken Fed independence, worsen deficits, and reorder the global trading system. “When you take all that into account, those market moves suddenly start to make a lot more sense,” Brown added. “Yes, the correlations are unusual. But, so is the macroeconomic environment, and so are the policy choices that continue to be made, as government spending runs away with itself across DM, rate cuts resume stateside, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside, and a potential economic re-acceleration looms now the initial trade/tariff uncertainty has (largely) been navigated.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person on Wednesday, as Oracle’s stock surged due to enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. Why it matters: The tight race between Musk and Ellison highlights the immense wealth generated by the tech industry and the growing importance of AI in driving stock valuations. The details: Since the beginning of the year, Ellison’s position in Bloomberg’s ranking has seen a significant increase, with a $191 billion boost as of Wednesday’s close, while Musk has experienced a $48 billion decline. What’s next: The race for the world’s richest person title may continue to fluctuate, depending on the performance of Oracle and Tesla shares in the coming days and weeks. #LarryEllison has just become the richest man in the world. His wealth is off the charts, and so are his carbon emissions! Along with other carbon billionaires, he’s turbo-charging the climate crisis while everyone else is paying the price.

Title: Business Is Booming for Many Tech Giants. They're Laying Workers Off Anyway.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."
