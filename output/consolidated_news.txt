While Fidelity and BlackRock dominate the performance charts, which ETFs are lagging behind? As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a broader downturn, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are not immune to the prevailing trends. Recent reports from Farside Investors reveal that BTC ETFs experienced significant outflows, amounting to $52.9 million on 2nd October. However, amidst this challenging landscape, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has identified two standout Bitcoin ETFs—BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC—as top performers of the 2020s. Both funds have achieved “stud level” status, boasting over $10 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), highlighting their resilience and appeal to investors even in turbulent times. In his X (formerly Twitter) post, Balchunas noted, Source: Eric Balchunas/X Echoing Balchunas’ sentiment, an X user added, Source: Charles/X This trend was further confirmed by data from Farside Investors, revealing that since its launch, BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed a staggering $21.5 billion in total inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC has attracted $9.9 billion. These two ETFs have set the pace, leaving other funds trailing. However, October, traditionally viewed as an “Uptober” month following a declining September, has brought mixed results. On the 1st of October, IBIT experienced an inflow of $40.8 million, contrasting sharply with FBTC, which faced outflows of $144.7 million. IBIT recorded outflows of $13.7 million on the 2nd of October, while FBTC rebounded with inflows of $21.1 million, illustrating the volatility and shifting dynamics within the ETF landscape. Conversely, the performance of Ethereum [ETH] ETFs has also been underwhelming. On the 1st of October, cumulative outflows for ETH ETFs reached $48.6 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA experiencing no inflows or outflows, while Fidelity’s FETH saw outflows of $25 million. ETHA continued to struggle, posting outflows of $18 million on the following day. Whereas FETH maintained a steady position with no flows recorded. This trend highlights the challenges facing Ethereum ETFs in the current market environment. Amidst there was another X user who asked a very concerning question, “Would this not then make #GBTC one of the worst performing ETFs of this decade?” This observation is further substantiated by the latest update from Farside Investors, revealing that Grayscale’s GBTC has experienced a staggering total outflow of $20.1 billion since its launch. Similarly, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF, ETHE, had faced significant outflows totaling $2.93 billion, which surpassed the combined outflows of all other ETH ETFs. On the price front, both cryptocurrencies were experiencing a downward trend, with Bitcoin trading at $60,480.03, reflecting a decline of 0.98% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum was trading at $2,347.81, showing a more substantial dip of 4.35% over the same period.

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said. The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet. He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Collapse of national security elites' cyber firm leaves bitter wake

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said. The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet.

Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020.

Title: TikTok Search, But It’s Going For Amazon; Can CTV Supply Outpace Demand?

Here’s today’s AdExchanger.com news round-up… Want it by email? Sign up here. Search High And Low TikTok announced this week that it would allow search advertising to be targeted by keyword. Previously, advertisers targeted specific audiences or types of audiences, but not actual search terms. TikTok’s growing search ad business is often framed as part of the overall threat to Google’s dominance. But TikTok search is part of a much sharper rivalry between the social media network and Amazon, according to Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. It is hard to square the heated rivalry between Amazon and TikTok with the companies’ recent advertising partnership. They’re often direct competitors, not complementary, and each is fighting hard to be the place for product discovery. Amazon and TikTok may be reluctant to give the other a leg up, but both want what the other has. Amazon needs targeted shopping supply and social media engagement; TikTok needs users to habituate themselves to purchasing on the platform. Amazon derives a huge advantage from the TikTok integration, since Amazon owns the customer and purchase data. TikTok gets another demand source, but as Amazon gets better and better at converting TikTok ad impressions to sales, TikTok earns no cut of the sales growth. As Seen On CTV Once upon a time, streaming was the shiny object of the ad industry. Now, ad supply outpaces demand, Ad Age reports. Part of that mismatch is due to media companies creating ad inventory seemingly out of thin air. Amazon will increase the rate of ads on Prime Video, while new placements like pause ads and home screen ads are spawning across streaming and smart TV services. Perhaps more importantly, media buyers remain disgruntled with the lack of pricing and measurement consistency. While the cost of cable TV is fairly consistent across the board (dayparts aside), streaming services launch ads with sky-high CPMs, then seemingly roll back prices at random. Plus, measurement is out of whack. Publishers still can’t agree on whether to sell and measure media based on GRPs or impressions, or what counts as premium inventory. Paired with the chronic lack of transparency in streaming buys, advertisers don’t necessarily see streaming as worth the cost and effort compared to cross-platform buys, one agency exec says. Considering CTV’s growing pains, it’s no wonder why buyers plan to spend more on social video than streaming this year. Going DEI-Free Pushy right-wingers aren’t the reason DEI programs are disappearing – or at least, not the only reason, Adweek reports. Shortly after the George Floyd protests in 2020, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives became a popular way for brands, agencies and vendors to address concerns from consumers and employees about racial inequality (and to look good in the process, a more cynical onlooker might say). Although DEI-related job postings increased a whopping 123% that year (per Indeed), not even two years later those jobs were already getting slashed in layoffs, NBC News reported. And now several major companies – including Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson – have publicly downscaled or even dropped their DEI initiatives. Conservative activists online would seem to be the most obvious instigating force here. But Adweek posits that last year’s Supreme Court decision against affirmative action had a more chilling effect, even though it only technically pertained to college admissions. Regardless, one thing seems pretty clear to both pro- and anti-DEI onlookers: None of these companies was that committed to the idea in the first place, if they were willing to flip so quickly. But Wait, There’s More! Apple Search Ads expands to Turkey and 20 additional countries.

Title: ‘Bitcoin is the exit door’ – Jack Mallers warns of USD fall

The Fed easing cycle will devalue USD but not BTC or gold, cautions Jack Mallers. Jack Mallers, CEO and founder of Bitcoin [BTC]-focused payment platform Strike, has urged investors with U.S. dollar savings to be cautious as the Fed easing cycle begins. According to the executive, the Fed liquidity injection, or money printing, will dilute USD-based savings, rendering them less valuable. He said those saving in USD would be better off in BTC. “The Fed has begun cutting rates. What does that mean? Financial authorities have decided who is paying for their mistakes: those holding US dollars. Get out of dollars. #Bitcoin is the exit door for everyone.” He added that the Fed’s money printing will eventually boost assets like BTC, but not USD savings. “Printing money, isn’t printing growth. In reality, it destroys those holding the currency. So, if you’re living off the USD value, your life will worsen over the next few years. It will only benefit those that can afford assets like Bitcoin.” Mallers noted that anyone should own BTC, even a fraction, since gold and BTC values will explode during the Fed easing cycle. The Strike executive is one of the major BTC bulls that have championed alternative savings to cushion from USD devaluation amid rising inflation. Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz is another champion in the space and has sounded the alarm about unsustainable US debt and its impact on inflation. Early in the year, Novogratz stated that if the U.S. doesn’t put its fiscal house in order, BTC and digital growth will continue. BlackRock recently echoed the same sentiment in a September report. The firm praised BTC as a ‘unique diversifier.’ Part of the asset manager’s report read, “Over the long term, bitcoin’s adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the intensity of concerns over global monetary stability, geopolitical stability, U.S. fiscal sustainability, and U.S. political stability.” That being said, BTC has been behaving like a ‘risk-on’ asset, with high negative sensitivity to geopolitical tensions, unlike gold. According to Presto Research, BTC was a blend of risk-on and risk-off properties, with ‘risk-on’ dominating in the near term. The asset was valued at $60.5K at press time, down 6% in the past seven days of trading.

Title: AI bubble or ‘revolution’? OpenAI’s big payday fuels debate
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2024/10/04/ai-bubble-or-revolution-openais-big-payday-fuels-debate

Friday, 04 Oct 2024 OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has closed a massive funding round, an investor said on Oct 2, 2024, as the company led by CEO Sam Altman seals its place as the world leader on artificial intelligence. — AFP SAN FRANCISCO: Fear of missing out has rocketed the value of artificial intelligence companies, despite few signs as to when the technology will turn a profit, raising talk of AI overenthusiasm. The mystery deepens when it comes to predicting which generative AI firms will prevail, according to analysts interviewed by AFP. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI secured US$6.6bil (RM27.95bil) in a funding round that propelled its valuation to an eye-popping US$157bil (RM664.94bil), sparking new worries there is an AI bubble poised to burst. "We are in the bubble where all the vendors are running around saying you have to deploy it as the latest digital transformation move," independent tech analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of generative AI. "I expect this ugly phase for the next two to three years, but then things should settle." To the critics, buyers don't really understand the technology, and the market needed for it to thrive is not mature yet. Enderle also contended that investors are pouring money into generative AI companies with the mistaken notion we are close to technology that has computers thinking the way humans do, called general artificial intelligence. That "holy grail" won't show up until 2030 at the earliest, he said. 'Revolution' is here Industry titans Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have thrown their weight behind the technology, entering into partnerships and pushing out products to accelerate adoption. But the tech giants are spending big to provide sometimes flawed features that for now cost them more than they take in from users. The huge investments in OpenAI shows that Big Tech is willing to sink "substantial cash into a company that's dealing with significant operation losses", Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon said of the OpenAI funding round. There's a "lingering fear of underinvesting in AI and losing out...even if investments are not guaranteed to provide returns", she said. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, is one of Wall Street's biggest believers in generative AI's importance and compared ChatGPT's emergence to an "iPhone moment" that will see one trillion dollars in spending during the next three years. An "AI Revolution is not just at our doorstep, but is actively shaping the future of the tech world," he said after OpenAI's historic fund-raise. Wall Street for now stands firmly with Ives and has sent the stock price of AI-chasing tech giants to record levels since ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022. Nvidia, the AI-chip juggernaut, in June briefly became the world's biggest company by market valuation amid the frenzy. But according to media reports, OpenAI will lose US$5bil (RM21.17bil) this year on sales of US$3.7bil (RM15.67bil). The company told investors the pain will be short-lived and that revenue will rise exponentially, hitting a whopping US$100bil (RM423.50bil) in 2029. More than poems? The question is whether people will pay for generative AI services such as Microsoft's CoPilot that depends on OpenAI technology, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, who pushed back against the idea of an AI bubble. "Consumers are going to start going beyond the write-the-poem-for-me stuff," Milanesi said. "It will become part of our lives and we will depend on it, because we will be forced to." But for now, the generative AI business model is tough, since data center and computing power costs dwarf revenue, according to analysts. Still, Milanesi doesn't think the tech industry is getting carried away with generative AI. "How this shakes out is the way to think about it, not so much the bubble bursting and everyone losing out," Milanesi said. "It's a bit of a Darwin situation where the survival of the fittest is happening," she said. And while there is more excitement about generative AI than real proof of its success, the technology is moving exceptionally fast. "Investors are not sure what the destination is, but everybody is jumping on the boat and they don't want to be left behind," Enderle said. "That typically ends badly," he said. – AFP Topic: Report it to us. Thank you for your report! Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)] Best viewed on Chrome browsers.

There is only so much stuff in a nation to produce goods or services. It’s guns or butter. Sandwiches or pizza. When less people work in a nation, there is less produced, and less that goes around.

A huge influx of immigrants into our country, without the ability to quickly build housing resulted in horrid living conditions for those immigrants and poor Americans. But the reality is, we can’t solve all the world’s problems. And bringing people from the 3rd world, who don’t respect our freedoms, social norms, and laws, in addition to the heightened demand for housing, AND low availability, will cause extreme havoc on our culture and way of life. These people need to stay in their own country and improve their own country if they want to live in better conditions. Making our lives worse doesn’t fix any of these issues. 15 posted on 10/03/2024 6:52:57 PM PDT by GeorgianaCavendish (Beam me up Scotty. There's no sign of intelligent life down here.)

RANCHERS & FARMERS & OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FOR A VERY LONG TIME TO “CREATE” THESE FEDERAL LANDS & PARKS. THIS WILL NOT SIT WELL WITH MOST AMERICANS. I know a number of single persons. NONE would support your idea. It shouldn’t sit well with every American. But…. Land deals and permit approvals will be made behind closed doors and America will be told that there’s nothing they can do about it. At the same time, they drive down wages for the lowest earning jobs. I think the corporate ownership and attempts at destroying neighborhoods are certainly problematic, BUT, it is just like how things were in the turn-of-the-century. A huge influx of immigrants into our country, without the ability to quickly build housing resulted in horrid living conditions for those immigrants and poor Americans. But the reality is, we can’t solve all the world’s problems. And bringing people from the 3rd world, who don’t respect our freedoms, social norms, and laws, in addition to the heightened demand for housing, AND low availability, will cause extreme havoc on our culture and way of life. These people need to stay in their own country and improve their own country if they want to live in better conditions. Making our lives worse doesn’t fix any of these issues. Those who work do . . . and certain businesses love it because the public is subsidizing their artificially low wages with Section 8 housing, EBT benefits and the like. **I know a number of single persons. NONE would support your idea.** If the SHTF in any way they might have to.

OpenAI’s Infrastructure Needs: OpenAI has discussed with the US government administration the need for massive AI data centers. Plans hinting at data centers each with a capacity of up to 5 GW (gigawatts), would scale AI data centers that are several times the current capacity of large cities. OpenAI wants to bjuild 5-7 of the super large AI data centers. Oracle’s Zettascale Plans Oracle announced at an event (#OCW24) the creation of the first zettascale OCI Supercluster, powered by NVIDIA’s Blackwell platform. This supercluster aims to allow customers to train and deploy next-generation AI models at an unprecedented scale. It could be years away. AI and Nuclear Power: There’s a trend towards integrating AI data centers with nuclear power. META’s AI chief mentioned building data centers next to nuclear power plants, suggesting a move to secure stable and high-capacity energy sources for AI operations. This comes alongside Microsoft’s power purchase agreement for nuclear energy, signaling a broader industry move towards nuclear power for sustainability and capacity reasons. 2. At OpenAI DevDay.

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Legal Officer, Jennifer Newstead, has sold 905 shares of the company's Class A common stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transaction, which took place on October 1, 2024, was executed at a price of $578.55 per share, resulting in a total sale amount of over $523,587. The sale was conducted under a pre-arranged trading plan, known as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which Newstead had adopted on November 30, 2023. These plans allow company insiders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time, providing an affirmative defense against accusations of trading on non-public, material information. Following the transaction, Newstead retains ownership of 35,102 shares of Meta Platforms' common stock. The company, formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specializing in computer programming, data processing, and other related services. Investors and market watchers often pay close attention to insider transactions as they can provide valuable insights into the company's health and the confidence levels of its top executives. However, it's important to note that these transactions do not necessarily indicate a change in company strategy or future performance. Meta Platforms has not released any official statement regarding this recent transaction by its Chief Legal Officer. The company's stock continues to be actively traded on the NASDAQ, and investors are encouraged to consider a wide range of factors when assessing the investment potential of META shares. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has been a focal point of various financial updates and regulatory news. Wells Fargo has raised its stock price target for Meta to $652, anticipating above-consensus earnings for 2025. The firm projects a 21% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue, estimating third-quarter revenue to be around $40.7 billion. On the regulatory front, Meta has faced a €91 million fine imposed by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. This adds to the company's growing tally of penalties under the EU's stringent General Data Protection Regulation. In collaboration with Australian banks, Meta has removed around 8,000 fraudulent ads from its platforms, a move amidst increasing scam reports in Australia and pending anti-scam legislation. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's future, with Pivotal Research giving Meta a Buy rating, citing the company's expansive user base and successful product development track record. Monness, Crespi, Hardt, and Rosenblatt Securities also maintain a positive outlook on Meta's stock, highlighting its potential in AI and metaverse innovations.

The company reported a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which InvestingPro highlights as "impressive gross profit margins." This high margin suggests Meta's efficient cost management and strong pricing power in the market.

Title: From Layoffs To Love Lost: Why Job Loss Can Lead To Divorce And How To Avoid It
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethpearson/2024/10/03/from-layoffs-to-love-lost-why-job-loss-can-lead-to-divorce-and-how-to-avoid-it/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T22:00:55Z

Loss of a job can increase the likelihood of divorce You’ve likely seen the headlines about looming job cuts, which are leading to 70% of U.S. workers to proactively prepare for the potential layoffs, according to a recent survey. And while it’s obvious that losing your job can be stressful, what you may not realize is that job loss is ranked as one of life’s most challenging experiences, so much so that some studies report losing a job can be more stressful than getting a divorce or even receiving a long-term illness diagnosis. Beyond the financial impact of getting laid off, it can take a serious toll on emotional health, self-worth, and even personal relationships. For those who’ve experienced a recent layoff, it’ll come as no surprise that it can affect your relationship—what is less talked about is that job loss is linked to increased rates of divorce. This correlation is complex to say the least and involves a mix of financial, emotional, and identity-related factors that create strain on a relationship, often in ways that may act as a knock-out blow to your marriage, partnership, or romantic relationship. For women, who juggle multiple responsibilities and face societal expectations around being a source of nurturing-stability, the impact of job loss can be feel even more intense. The last thing you want to after you’ve lost your job is to lose your support system too, so let’s break down why it feels so apocalyptic when you get axed and what you can do to safeguard your marriage, or partnership, in the wake of its wrath. While experiencing the end of a marriage is incredibly difficult, studies have shown that individuals tend to eventually return to their previous level of well-being after such event. If you really think about it, divorce often provides some level of closure, allowing those involved to eventually heal and move on. However, the emotional and psychological impact of losing your job may linger inevitability, and can feel even more overwhelming if you’re in a specialized field or had a high-level role, which on average have fewer opportunities and take significantly longer to replace. The uncertainty around job loss is what makes it so hard for couples to deal with. It can create a prolonged period of feeling “stuckness,” with no clear end in sight. So, unlike a breakup or divorce, where you may regain a sense of autonomy and direction, the helplessness that can come from searching for a new job creates an ongoing sense of instability. It’s that uncertainty which causes tension and could lead to the employed partner resenting the unemployed partner for not contributing financially—which could trigger feelings of worthlessness or failure, adding further strain on the relationship. Set Realistic Expectations Together: Sit down with your partner to discuss a plan. Setting realistic expectations around the job search timeline, budget adjustments, and how to support each other can alleviate the anxiety of uncertainty. Aligning your expectations will help you both navigate this period without placing undue pressure on your relationship. One of the most obvious effects of losing a job is the financial strain that comes with it, and the loss of one income can lead to an immediate sense of imbalance. When bills pile up and expenses outweigh income, a scarcity mindset can lead to arguments, resentment, and fear. Then, once that financial foundation begins to crack, it’s easy for both partners to start blaming one another and when that happens, you’re no longer trying to solve the problem as a team, but rather turning on one another and intensifying the tension and panic. It may be no surprise then that debt and financial stress are of the most cited reasons for divorce, with research finding that 54% of people believe them to be valid to consider divorce—and job loss can amplify it tenfold. The pressure to "make ends meet" can quickly turn into tension and conflict, with both partners feeling unsupported or misunderstood. Create a New Financial Plan Together: Review your finances and create a new budget that reflects your current reality. Openly discussing finances can help prevent misunderstandings and resentment. This also allows you both to find ways to cut costs and avoid debt, reducing financial stress and strengthening your bond. If you have a financial advisor/planner, it’s a great idea to get with them and get a true understanding on if there’s any immediate need to panic, or if you have some time before you need avoid Amazon and Target like the plague. A job is much more than a paycheck—it often provides a sense of identity, self-worth, and purpose. For many, career success is closely tied to feelings of confidence, respect, and stability. When you lose your job, you may feel like you’ve lost an essential part of yourself. This is especially true in our society which places such a high value on productivity and professional achievement. For women, whose identities are often interwoven with various roles—professional, caregiver, partner—job loss can feel like a personal failure, even if the circumstances were beyond their control. The loss of a job can trigger deep emotional responses, including shame, anxiety, and depression, all of which can negatively affect relationships. Some signs you might be struggling include becoming withdrawn, irritable, or overly dependent on your partner for validation. The resulting emotional strain can create distance, making it harder for your partner to connect with you. Over time, the disconnect can widen, leading to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction for both partners. Reconnect with Your Identity Outside of Work: To preserve your sense of self-worth, invest time in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your career. Whether it’s taking up a hobby, volunteering, or spending time with friends, these pursuits can help you maintain a sense of identity and purpose, reducing the emotional toll of job loss. Communicate Openly with Your Partner: Share your feelings about the job loss with your partner, including any fears or insecurities you have. Being vulnerable can foster empathy and understanding, helping to maintain emotional intimacy and ensuring your partner knows how to support you. While losing your job can feel like a crisis, certain factors can help alleviate the stress and mitigate the risk of damaging your relationship. Understanding what might help can be the key to surviving this challenging period together. Support from Family and Friends: Having a strong support network can make a significant difference and leaning on them can help reduce the pressure on your relationship by not relying solely on your partner for comfort. Living in an Area with High Unemployment: This may sound counterintuitive, but if unemployment is high in your area, it can normalize your experience and reduce feelings of shame or inadequacy. The shared experience can help you feel less isolated and reassure both you and your partner that the situation is not a reflection of your abilities or worth. Having an Extroverted Personality: Extroverted individuals tend to reach out for help and support more readily, which can be a crucial asset when dealing with job loss. If you’re naturally inclined to seek out social connections, it can help you stay positive and motivated. For those who are more introverted, making an intentional effort to connect with others can provide similar benefits. The loss of a job is undoubtedly a significant stressor, but it doesn’t have to lead to the end of your relationship. By being proactive, communicating openly, and making decisions together, you and your partner can navigate this difficult time as a team. Remember, your worth is not determined by your employment status, and your relationship can thrive even in the face of financial or emotional challenges. One Community. Many Voices.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground ahead of Friday morning's release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' September jobs report. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a minimal decline of less than 0.1%. Shares of beer, wine, and spirits maker Constellation Brands (STZ) dropped 4.7%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on the day after the company released mixed results for its fiscal second quarter. The company behind the Corona and Modelo brands reported strong beer sales during the period but pointed to macroeconomic challenges affecting the alcoholic beverage industry. Bio-Techne (TECH) shares sank 4.4% on Thursday. In its most recent quarterly report, released in August, the provider of reagents and other health care diagnostics products missed earnings per share (EPS) expectations. A year-over-year jump in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs weighed on results. According to analysts, Bio-Techne also faces stiff competition in an industry that requires rapid innovation. Telsa (TSLA) shares lost 3.4% after the carmaker recalled around 27,000 of its Cybertrucks because of an issue with the vehicles' rearview camera. When the Cybertruck is put in reverse, the rear-facing image can appear blank for up to eight seconds, according to a filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This marks the fifth recall for the Cybertruck since its release last year. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), which operates an electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, notched Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, popping 7.5% higher after the company reported record levels of trading volume across its platforms in September. The company highlighted strong year-over-year volume growth in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipals. Crude oil futures prices jumped more than 5% to reach their highest level since August amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The latest uptick in oil prices helped boost numerous stocks in the energy sector. Shares of refiner Valero Energy (VLO) jumped 6.2%. Shares of Texas-based energy generator Vistra Corp. (VST) surged 5.7% to an all-time closing high after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), said the tech giant is exploring ways to power its artificial intelligence (AI) data centers using nuclear energy. Analysts expressed optimism that last month's deal between Microsoft (MSFT) and Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania could pave the way for additional agreements between big tech firms and nuclear generators. On Thursday, RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Vistra shares to $141 from $105. Constellation Energy shares were up 4.5% on Thursday following reports that the company aims to secure a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee to help fund the Three Mile Island project. According to The Washington Post, Constellation submitted a request for the government-backed loan to the Department of Energy in May, and after passing an initial review, the application is now in a negotiation stage.

Title: How Does OpenAI's Price Tag Stack Up to Survivors of the Dotcom Bubble?

OpenAI's latest fundraising round has made the ChatGPT maker one of the world's most valuable startups, and an unusually costly investment from a historical perspective. On Wednesday, Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion fundraising round that valued the nonprofit startup at the center of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) craze at more than $150 billion, nearly double its valuation just a few months ago. If OpenAI were a public company in the S&P 500, it would be among the index’s 70 largest components and have a market value roughly equivalent to that of AT&T (T) and Pfizer (PFE). But OpenAI, if it was a public company, wouldn’t be eligible for the S&P 500 because it's never been profitable. Nor have many of its major competitors like Amazon (AMZN)-backed Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, or Safe SuperIntelligence (SSI), the organization born out of the recent schism between OpenAI and its former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. The valuations of AI startups have skyrocketed this year as they’ve attracted billions of dollars in investment from tech giants and venture capital firms. Anthropic is in the midst of a fundraising round and is expected to be valued at as much as $40 billion. xAI has been valued at $24 billion and SSI is worth an estimated $5 billion just three months after its founding. These unprofitable firms trade at a high multiple. A Deutsche Bank analysis estimates Anthropic is likely to be valued at 50 times its full-year sales, while OpenAI is valued at almost 40x sales. At the height of the dotcom bubble, Microsoft's and Oracle's (ORCL) price-to-sales ratios peaked around 30. Their valuations also dwarf those of America's largest tech companies. Nvidia (NVDA), expected to book $90 billion in profit in the next year, trades at 30x annual sales. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft, two of the most profitable companies in the world, trade at price-to-sales ratios in the low teens. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit organization with a for-profit arm through which investors can stake a claim to future profits. Last month, reports emerged that the company was planning to convert to a for-profit company, and its latest fundraising reportedly made the investments conditional on its completing that conversion in the next two years. Even so, it could be a while before the company does turn a profit. OpenAI as a whole is expected to lose $5 billion this year, according to analyses by The New York Times and The Information. The number of monthly users of its chatbot ChatGPT, OpenAI's main source of revenue, more than tripled between March and June of this year, and ChatGPT's revenue is expected to quadruple to $2.7 billion this year. But those users come at a high cost—renting the servers to run ChatGPT will cost an estimated $4 billion this year. Growing revenue will be vital to the profitability of OpenAI, and the company has set ambitious goals for itself. According to documents reviewed by the Times, the company expects to grow sales from nearly $4 billion this year to $11.6 billion in 2025. It's targeting $100 billion in revenue in 2029, which would require a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 90% over the next five years. By comparison, analysts forecast Nvidia's revenue will grow at a CAGR of 33% through 2026.

Title: Why Vistra Stock Jumped to Another Record High on Thursday

The gains keep coming for shares of independent power producer Vistra Corp. (VST), which jumped more than 5% on Thursday to notch one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and set a new record closing high. The Texas-based electricity provider has ridden a wave of enthusiasm about using nuclear capacity to power energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) processes. These AI-driven expectations have helped Vistra surpass Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, up a whopping 244% year to date. The most recent push higher for the red-hot Vistra stock came after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), said the tech giant is exploring ways to power its data centers using electricity from nuclear plants. Vistra shares gained 5.7% on Thursday to close at $132.45, bucking a broader downturn for U.S. stocks. In an interview with Japan's Nikkei, Pichai said Google is evaluating investments in a variety of energy technologies as it aims to achieve its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. The CEO provided no details as to where Alphabet might source nuclear power. However, announcements this year by other big tech firms support the idea that U.S.-based nuclear generators are poised to benefit from the opportunity. For instance, Amazon (AMZN) said in March that it would lean on nuclear generation to meet some of its power demand. Microsoft (MSFT) also reached an agreement in September with Vistra competitor Constellation Energy (CEG) to procure power from the currently shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Analysts have expressed optimism that Microsoft's deal with Constellation Energy could set a precedent for more agreements between big tech and nuclear generators. On Thursday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets increased their price target on Vistra stock to $141 from $105.

Title: BlackRock sees Bitcoin volatility continuing to fall

Share this article At the Digital Assets Conference held today, BlackRock unveiled its latest insights on Bitcoin’s volatility and future performance, stating that Bitcoin’s volatility has significantly decreased and will continue to do so over time. BREAKING: BITCOINS VOLATILITY HAS DECLINED AND WILL CONTINUE TO FALL – BLACKROCK pic.twitter.com/iCWafcyLyD — marty (@thinkingvols) October 3, 2024 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, emphasized Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial ecosystem. According to BlackRock, Bitcoin’s volatility has been declining steadily, a trend that the firm expects to continue as adoption grows and the asset matures. BlackRock’s data showed that adding Bitcoin to portfolios improved risk-adjusted returns across multiple time horizons. Portfolios with a 1%, 3%, or 5% Bitcoin allocation saw higher returns over one, two, five, and ten-year periods compared to traditional portfolios. While Bitcoin slightly increased volatility in these hypothetical portfolios, the potential for higher returns often outweighed the added risk. For example, portfolios with a 5% Bitcoin allocation achieved a 19.1% return over the long term, significantly outperforming the 11% return from traditional portfolios without Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock’s analysis also emphasized the importance of long-term holding when it comes to Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the firm, Bitcoin’s lowest four-year trailing return is still an impressive 137%, and holding the asset for three or more years has consistently delivered positive returns. Additionally, BlackRock compared Bitcoin to gold and US Treasuries, emphasizing its fixed supply, decentralized governance, and low correlation with traditional assets, positioning it as a hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies. Moreover, BlackRock noted that while Bitcoin’s volatility remains elevated, it has declined as the asset matured. The analysis showed Bitcoin’s low correlation with gold (0.1) and the S&P 500 (0.2), highlighting its role as an independent asset class. Lastly, BlackRock emphasized Bitcoin as a hedge against the declining value of fiat currencies, especially the US dollar. Highlighting the dollar’s drop since 1913, they positioned Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation. By offering Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock signals its trust in Bitcoin’s long-term value and growing role in financial markets. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said during an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that demand for the tech giant’s Blackwell “Superchip” is “insane,” sending Nvidia shares up more than 3% on Thursday. Huang noted the demand for Blackwell in a CNBC interview Wednesday. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ... [+] Images) Nvidia shares reached as high as $124.26 on Thursday before cooling down to $122.80 at market close, a 3.3% jump. The strong trading day materialized after Huang said there was “insane” demand for Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chip from companies such as Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta and other AI-adjacent firms, telling CNBC, “Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.” The Thursday stock jump continues a streak of Nvidia gains since early September, when the chip designer’s shares slumped to $102.83 despite reporting record revenues about a week prior. Blackwell-based products will be shipped to cloud service divisions at Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft and Google late this year, according to Nvidia’s website.

Stocks were broadly down on the day. The S&P 500 dropped as Nvidia’s rise was not enough to pull the tech-heavy Nasdaq out of the red, with the index closing down .17% on Thursday. We estimate Huang’s net worth at $107 billion following a $3 billion increase Thursday, making the Nvidia chief the twelfth-richest person in the world. The next-generation chip from Nvidia can train AI models at fast speeds while using a relatively low share of energy consumption. Blackwell’s price tag is expected to be between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, according to CNBC. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip will further cement the company as a leader in the artificial intelligence market while it continues to provide products and services for tech leaders like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, which accounts for a large portion of its revenue. Despite some sharp, yet short-lived, drops between July and September, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 147% since the start of the year, when it traded at $48.17 per share. The company also posted record revenues in its second quarter, recording $30 billion in sales and $16.5 billion in net income. Nvidia’s datacenter division, home to some of its AI offerings, generated $26.3 billion in revenue during the quarter, a 154% year-over-year increase.

Title: CFTC votes on allowing DLT-based collateral in commodities and derivatives trading
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/cftc-votes-on-allowing-dlt-based-collateral-in-commodities-and-derivatives-trading/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T19:53:59Z
Full Content:
In a significant development for the digital assets market, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is reportedly considering a proposal that would enable the use of digital ledger technology (DLT)-based collateral in commodities and derivatives trading. According to Bloomberg, a subcommittee of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee recently voted to recommend this proposal, which, if approved, could streamline transactions and promote broader adoption of digital assets in traditional finance. If the proposal receives final approval from the main committee, it could lead to a paradigm shift in how trading collateral is managed. The adoption of DLT-based collateral would allow traders to settle transactions using digital assets with the same speed and efficiency that digital ledger and blockchain technology offers. This change would enable brokers to accept tokenized assets, such as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) token, through market-embedded systems. While the use of blockchain-based assets as collateral is already gaining traction among major financial institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan, the CFTC’s potential approval would catalyze broader adoption across the industry. As it stands, only large firms have been able to utilize these innovative financial instruments, but this move could open the doors for smaller market participants to access similar benefits. Despite the positive momentum surrounding the proposal, several steps remain before it can be formally submitted for CFTC approval. The main committee must first review and endorse the subcommittee’s recommendation, and there are no guarantees that the CFTC will approve the proposal in its current form. Regulatory concerns may arise regarding which institutions and blockchains are permitted to participate, which could introduce potential restrictions that may limit the scope of the initiative. Furthermore, the broader context of digital assets in traditional finance cannot be ignored. Recent trends, such as strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicate a growing acceptance and interest in digital assets among institutional investors. For instance, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has recently outperformed its peers, witnessing the highest daily inflow of any fund on September 25, marking a five-day streak of inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. This surge in interest may influence the CFTC’s decision-making process as they consider the implications of allowing digital assets as collateral. As this unfolds, stakeholders will be watching closely as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, potentially paving the way for a more integrated future for digital assets in commodities and derivatives trading.

Title: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son Says A.I. Will Soon Be 10,000 Times Smarter Than Humans

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is flush with cash, thanks to the likes of Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank (SFTBF). The Japanese conglomerate chipped in $500 million during a recent funding round that valued the Sam Altman-led company at a staggering $157 billion. Announced yesterday (Oct. 2) and led by Thrive Capital, the $6.6 billion round also drew in A.I.-focused companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) and investment firms such as Tiger Global Management, ARK Invest and Altimeter Capital. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Son didn’t directly address his investment while speaking today (Oct. 3) at the SoftBank World 2024 conference. But he praised OpenAI and the capabilities of the company’s recently released GPT-o1 A.I. models, codenamed “Strawberry,” describing them as having “developed the ability to think.” Son said he recently tested out the reasoning model by asking it a series of difficult questions, such as how to increase his savings account to 100 million Japanese yen ($681,000), and was impressed by its answers. Son, currently the second richest person in Japan, is estimated to be worth $31.4 billion. A.I. is on track to become even more powerful in the near future, Son said. His vision for A.I. includes personal agents that will be able to conduct a variety of everyday tasks, ranging from grocery shopping and making reservations to aiding in investments and monitoring the health of family members. “This technology will evolve to a point where your happiness will be its greatest reward,” said Son, adding that human happiness will be the “greatest reward” for personal agents. Such comments aren’t out of character for Son, who is known for his unrelenting optimism when it comes technological developments. This attitude has caused SoftBank’s Vision Funds to make ambitious tech bets that typically realize either major gains or losses. During the dot-com crash, for example, SoftBank lost some $170 billion on its internet investments. Son also infamously shed some $14 billion after backing the now-bankrupt WeWork. While Son spent the past few years laying low following a series of losses, he told investors last year that SoftBank was going on “offense mode” and was preparing to invest heavily in A.I., having amassed more than $35 billion since 2020. According to Son, A.I.’s developments will come fast and furious. Artificial general intelligence (A.G.I), a type of A.I. that matches the intelligence of humans, will come to fruition in the next two to three years, Son said at today’s event. And artificial superintelligence, (A.S.I.), which is 10,000 times more capable than humans, can be expected to be achieved in a decade, he claimed. Noting that the human brain consists of some 100 trillion synaptic connections, referring to points where neurons communicate with each other, Son said that “generative A.I.’s parameters—which are equivalent to these synapses—are growing at a furious pace.” (GPT-4 reportedly has about 1.7 trillion parameters.) To take advantage of the technology’s potential, the SoftBank CEO has ambitious plans to turn his conglomerate into an A.I. powerhouse. SoftBank’s A.I. strategy is currently anchored by Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer it acquired for $32 billion in 2016. Son has previously laid out his desire to eventually establish a variety of A.I.-focused divisions within SoftBank, complete with sectors dedicated to A.I. chips, data centers and even industrial robots. Besides SoftBank’s recent backing of OpenAI, the conglomerate in 2024 alone has also invested in Perplexity AI, an A.I.-powered search startup, and acquired Graphcore, a chipmaker and Nvidia rival.

Title: A mayor promises Ozempic for all and says there 'will be no more fat people' in his city

A Brazilian politician is making an interesting campaign pitch: Ozempic for all. Eduardo Paes, the current mayor of Rio de Janeiro, is seeking reelection and just promised to make a generic version of Ozempic available through the city’s public health network, if he wins. “I took a lot of Ozempic, that little medicine that is helping everyone lose weight,” Paes told the Brazilian newspaper Extra on Tuesday, adding that he lost 66 pounds. “Its patent will expire next year, and it will be available as a generic and I will introduce it to the entire public health system,” Paes said. “Rio will be a city where there will be no more fat people, everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics.” Ozempic, produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO), is a GLP-1 treatment for diabetes. It works by mimicking a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite, and as a result has become highly sought after for its weight loss effects. Skyrocketing sales for GLP-1 medications have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. In Brazil, a month’s supply of Ozempic costs about 1,000 Brazilian Reals ($182.36). Its patent in the country is set to expire sometime in the next two years, allowing for cheaper generic versions of the drug to enter the market. Paes’s remarks have gone viral on social media and have been criticized by his opponents. Alexandre Ramagem, another candidate running for mayor, posted a video on his Instagram account of Rio resident complaining about a lack of basic medicines in the family clinics. Tarcísio Motta, who is also running for mayor, told Brazilian media that Paes comments were “disrespectful to the diversity of bodies” in the city and an “encouragement of fatphobia.” Paes responded to his critics and said that he is not fatphobic. “When the patent is broken, which should happen in 2025 or 2026, it will reduce the cost enormously,” Paes said. “Why not make it available to the population? We’re not going to give it away for vain reasons. It’s not to make six-packs.” Paes’s comments come as governments around the world are trying to expand access to GLP-1 drugs. England’s National Health Services (NHS) announced today a plan to provide Eli Lilly’s weight loss drug to nearly a quarter million people over three years. In September, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in a a Senate committee hearing, called on Novo Nordisk to slash the list price of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States, where they currently cost $968 per month.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter results before the bell next Thursday, Oct. 10, its first report since July's worldwide IT outage caused by a CrowdStrike (CRWD) software update forced the carrier to cancel thousands of flights, costing it an estimated $500 million. Analysts expect a slight year-over-year gain in revenue to $15.69 billion, with net income projected to tick lower to $1.10 billion, according to analysts' consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts covering Delta tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on the airline's stock, with an average target price of $61.40, about 30% above Thursday afternoon's share price of $47.38. In July, Delta posted record second-quarter revenue, but a number of costs rose at least 20%, leading profit to come in well below what analysts had expected, and shares fell 4% that day. Revenue could continue its strong pace set in the first two quarters of the year, as airlines have said travel demand has remained strong, with July 4 travel setting TSA checkpoint records. However, Delta is also likely to have lost out on some revenue and incurred costs handling the mid-July IT outage. Delta's Q2 results came about a week before the IT outage that hindered Delta's operations for several days. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian estimated that the canceled flights and compensation for passengers cost the airline at least $500 million. Delta was the hardest hit of the major airlines, and said it has considered legal action against CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT), but the tech companies have said they aren't responsible for the age of Delta's IT infrastructure or how the airline responded to the outage.

Title: Nvidia stock rises after Jensen Huang says demand for its new AI chips is 'insane'

Nvidia’s (NVDA) next-generation artificial intelligence chip is in full production, and demand for it is “insane,” according to CEO Jensen Huang. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said about the company’s highly anticipated AI platform, Blackwell, during a Wednesday evening appearance on CNBC. Shares of the chipmaker were up almost 3% during midday trading Thursday. Nvidia’s stock has climbed over 152% so far this year. When the company reported second-quarter earnings in August, Huang said that the company had shipped samples of Blackwell to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. In early August, the chipmaker saw its shares fall after a report that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws, possibly pushing deliveries back by at least three months. However, during its earnings call, Nvidia said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,” in the fourth quarter. The company added that demand for its Hopper chips remains strong and that it expects shipments to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. Huang said demand for Blackwell, which he previously said “is well above supply,” was making customers “emotional” and “tense,” during an interview at Goldman Sachs’s (GS) technology conference in September. “At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,” Huang said during his interview on CNBC (CMCSA). “We’re on a path to do that, and everything’s on track.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

As market participants analyze the implications of this purchase, it's worth noting that the actions of large shareholders can have a significant impact on investor sentiment and the market performance of the stocks they trade. Adding to the recent purchase by Saba Capital Management, BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) presents an interesting profile for investors.

Title: Investing giants want to offer retail traders access to a booming sector of financial markets
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/private-credit-etf-state-street-apollo-sec-investor-investing-funds-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-03T17:04:35Z
Full Content:
A booming corner of the financial markets that has only been available to institutions might soon be open to everyday investors. According to The Wall Street Journal, some of the biggest private equity and investment management giants want to offer retail investors access to exchange-traded funds backed by private credit. The term broadly refers to loans made to companies and consumers by nonbank lenders. Historically, fund managers have sold "alternative assets" like private debt to institutional investors at a high cost, generating returns of around 10% in recent years — more than they would have seen from investing in the stock or bond markets. Now, as those institutions slow allocations to private credit, the biggest players in the space want to target a new class of investors. According to the Journal, firms like State Street, Apollo Global Management, and BlackRock are working to roll out private credit ETFs to regular investors. The challenge, though, is building a highly liquid ETF out of illiquid private loans. That hurdle is also what will likely draw the eye of regulators as they ensure the ETFs are appropriate for retail investors. But if these ETFs get approved, they will enable regular investors to tap into a booming market, one that BlackRock expects will more than double to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The race to launch private credit ETFs has heated up in recent months. In May, Capital Group and KKR teamed up to start offering funds investing in both public and private assets—including in private credit—starting next year. Last month, State Street proposed a private debt ETF to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ETF would blend public debt with private debt on mortgage, corporate, and consumer loans purchased from Apollo Global Management. Anna Paglia, State Street's chief business officer, said in a statement the ETF would "democratize access to private asset exposures," and make them "more accessible to a wider swathe of investors." "It is our goal to bring these investments to scale and help facilitate the process of making private assets more accessible and liquid over time. We see this as only the beginning of a new wave of innovation as public and private markets increasingly converge," Paglia said. Alternative assets make up a small share—less than 3%—of individual investors' global investments, KKR's head of Global Client Solutions Eric Mogelof, told the Wall Street Journal. But he says there is huge potential for that share to grow by over three times. "We anticipate these allocations to rise to 10% or greater in the future," he told the Journal.

In a recent transaction, Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has expanded its holdings in the company. The investment firm purchased an additional 25,228 shares of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust at a price of $7.54 per share, amounting to a total investment of over $190,000. The purchase, which took place on October 1, 2024, increases Saba Capital Management's stake in the trust to a total of 55,819,832 shares. This move demonstrates the firm's continued confidence in the performance and growth potential of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, which focuses on long-term capital appreciation. The transaction was disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Saba Capital Management's significant share acquisition reflects its strategic investment decisions and the value it sees in the trust's future. Investors often monitor such purchases by major shareholders as they can indicate a positive outlook on the company's prospects. With the additional shares, Saba Capital Management further solidifies its position as a major investor in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. Saba Capital Management's recent acquisition of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) shares aligns with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. One of the most striking features of BIGZ is its substantial dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.61%. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting that the trust "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." For income-focused investors, this high yield could be a compelling reason to consider BIGZ, especially given Saba Capital's increased stake. The trust's current P/E ratio of 7.87 suggests it may be undervalued compared to its peers, potentially explaining Saba Capital's interest in increasing its position. This relatively low P/E ratio could indicate an opportunity for value investors. However, it's worth noting that InvestingPro Tips also point out some challenges. The trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors might explain why the trust trades at a seemingly attractive valuation despite its high dividend yield. BIGZ has shown positive price performance across various timeframes, with a notable 24.18% total return over the past year. This performance, coupled with the trust trading at 91.64% of its 52-week high, suggests that the market has been warming up to BIGZ's potential. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics beyond those mentioned here. The platform provides a total of 8 tips for BIGZ, offering a deeper dive into the trust's financial health and market position.

Title: Zepbound is no longer in shortage. Hims & Hers stock took a hit because of it
URL: https://qz.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-fda-shortage-over-1851664423
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:38:00Z
Full Content:
The shortage of Eli Lilly’s (LLY) blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Wednesday, marking the popular drugs’ shortages as resolved. The news could put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand versions of GLP-1 weight loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring demand for these treatments have transformed Eli Lilly and its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Skyrocketing demand has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro was added to the FDA’s drug shortage database in 2022, while Zepbound was added this April. “Because Lilly’s FDA-approved medicines are available, patients should not be exposed to the higher risks posed by untested, unapproved knockoffs,” an Eli Lilly spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “The entities currently mass-producing and mass-marketing compounded and counterfeit tirzepatide need to stop immediately.” The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS), which recently began offering a compounded version of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy — saw its stock drop by over 11% during Wednesday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brandname weight loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. Geoff Cook, CEO of the weight loss app Noom, which recently began offering compounded semaglutide to its members, urged regulators in September to proceed cautiously when considering lifting the shortage declaration for brandname weight loss drugs. He warned that ending the declaration too soon could restrict consumers’ access to more affordable alternatives. “We just continue to urge policy makers to take into account the fact that patients losing access to their medication is not a good thing and especially losing it over night would be not a good thing,” Cook told Quartz on Wednesday. If and when the FDA declares an end to the semaglutide shortage, Cook said Noom would continue offering branded GLP-1 treatments and other weight loss medications to its members. The company may also explore offering even more customized compounded versions of semaglutide that can be taken sublingually, instead of by injection. Additionally, Cook supports efforts by Rep. Lloyd Doggett and Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has urged Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to help lower the cost of semaglutide by using existing law to allow for generic competition, ahead of patent expirations. In the short term, Cook expects patients who were on compounded tirzepatide to switch over to a compounded semaglutide treatment.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the upstart Texas Stock Exchange will help transform Dallas into the country’s top financial center and boost businesses’ access to capital. “Dallas, Texas, is already a massive financial center, but when you put a stock exchange in there, that will make it really the financial heartbeat of the entire country,” Abbott said Tuesday in an interview. “It’s going to completely transform Dallas.” Abbott, a Republican, said he’s working to change perceptions of the US financial landscape outside of New York, noting that Texas now has more people employed in financial services than the Empire State. He said the robust expansion of data centers over the past few years in Texas will help facilitate rapid transaction speeds once the exchange is operational. Abbott spoke a day after meeting with officials from the new bourse, who announced hires from Charles Schwab Corp., Nasdaq Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange to build up its leadership team ahead of plans to begin operations next year. With the backing of BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities and other investors, the Texas Stock Exchange has raised $135 million and plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few months, Chief Executive Officer James Lee said Monday. The Texas governor said he had spoken with Elon Musk about the possibility of listing his closely held companies on the exchange, and received a positive reception. “I think it is the kind of thing that is really up his alley,” Abbott said. “This really dovetails with the way Elon Musk does business.” Musk, whose closely held companies include SpaceX, Neuralink and X, didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment. Companies that list on the exchange won’t need to meet any environmental, social and governance thresholds, in line with a pledge to slash burdensome regulations for businesses, Lee said Monday. Abbott and the Texas Republican Party have been at the forefront of efforts by lawmakers to crack down on so-called ESG investment practices that take into consideration non-financial factors such as environmental risks.

A recipient of the Rooney Prize and a member of Aosdána, Anne has been publishing for more than 25 years. Her lecture, entitled ‘Writing in the Stupid Age’, will speak to the regression of language and culture in our modern times: ‘To explain it, briefly: we are in thrall to a culture processed through the new technology, a technology we are dazzled by. Our capacities are becoming redundant, our individual agency is fading away, our language dwindles into cliche. Essential components of our human intelligence, our human forms of expression, are in the process of being discarded and even suppressed. We seem to be happy, even eager, to allow our freedom, our very capacity to think, to be taken from us.’ The lecture will take place on Wednesday 23rd of October in the United Arts Club, 3 Fitzwiliam Street Upper, Dublin 2. Tickets are available here. Irish writers Kevin Power and Sarah Webb are among the judges announced this week by Caffè Nero as judges for the 2024 Nero Book Awards.

Murray described winning the Nero Gold Prize as “a tremendous honour”. Winning the prize propelled The Bee Sting to a wider audience, with the paperback jumping from #3,724 to #129 in the Amazon book charts the morning after the announcement. Simon Prosser, Hamish Hamilton publishing director, said: “Winning the Fiction Category and Gold Prize was a great extra boost for The Bee Sting as we prepared to launch our paperback edition, and we were delighted when the book went straight into the Top 5 of the Sunday Times paperback fiction bestseller chart.” Belfast author Michael Magee won the debut fiction prize for Close to Home.

Author of A Thread of Violence, Notes from an Apocalypse and To Be a Machine, O’Connell’s creative non-fiction has gained national and international renown. His exploration of transhumanism in his first book To Be a Machine: Adventures Among Cyborgs, Utopians, Hackers was awarded the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize and the 2019 Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. He was also shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. From extreme biohacking in Silicon Valley to doomsday ‘preppers’ in New Zealand, Mark draws on the personal to interrogate the collective crises facing humanity. Published at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back was described by Sally Rooney as “the perfect handbook for the end of times” and provides a fascinating insight into the measures being taken around the world to escape the apocalypse. His most recent work, A Thread of Violence: A Story of Truth, Invention, and Murder, revisits the crimes of Dublin socialite Malcolm Macarthur. Bestselling author Colm Toíbín describes this work as having been “nourished by a powerful moral intelligence and an enormous curiosity”. O’Connell was awarded his PhD in English (2011) from Trinity College Dublin and is a former alumnus of the Trinity Long Room Hub where he spent time as an early career research fellow. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, The New York Times Magazine, and The Guardian. He is also a columnist for The Irish Times. He said: “I’m absolutely thrilled to be given the opportunity to spend time at the Trinity Long Room Hub as Writer Fellow. Having spent a year here in 2011 as a postdoctoral researcher, the Hub was an important place for my development as a writer. It’s wonderful to be back here, and to be part of a community of scholars, whose fascinating research is likely to spark off all kinds of inspiration in my own work”. Trinity Long Room Hub Director Eve Patten commented: “The Rooney fellowship provides a space for writers to engage with some of the cutting-edge research covered by Trinity’s arts and humanities disciplines. Given the intersection of Mark’s writing with many of our key research areas, this promises to be a fertile collaboration.” Previous fellows have included author Caitríona Lally, poet and fabulist Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe and Booker-prize nominated author Paul Murray. * Novelist and short story writer Ross Raisin has won the 19th BBC National Short Story Award with Cambridge University (NSSA) for ‘Ghost Kitchen’, a tense, cinematic story narrated by a bicycle courier and inspired by the gig economy and the ‘dark kitchens’ of the restaurant industry.

Title: Costco is now selling platinum bars. Here's the price of a bar.

Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: October 3, 2024 / 3:55 PM EDT / CBS News Costco is expanding its precious metals offerings, building on top of its rollout last year of gold bars, which often sold out within hours. The retailer is now adding 1-ounce platinum bars to its lineup. Described as 999.5 pure platinum, the new bar is Swiss-made by a refiner that has earned the Good Delivery accreditation from the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), an international trade association for the precious metals industry. Costco's gold bars were such a hit with customers that the retailer had trouble keeping them in stock. After the retailer added silver coins to its lineup, Wells Fargo estimated that the chain was selling as much as $200 million of gold and silver each month to its members. The platinum bar is retailing for $1,089.99 — if you can get it. The bar is only sold online, and Costco says delivery is unavailable in Nevada, Louisiana and Puerto Rico. But the Costco site on Thursday also noted that the platinum bar was unavailable for delivery in several other locations throughout the U.S., including New York and Utah. Costco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yes, Costco says it is limiting members to one purchase, with a maximum of five platinum bars per transaction. The precious metal, which is used in jewelry as well as for industrial items such as catalytic converters, hasn't had the same kind of recent performance as gold, which has long been viewed by investors as a hedge against inflation as well as a source of financial stability when stock and bond markets are volatile. During the past year, the spot price for platinum has increased about 16%, compared with a 42% gain for gold, FactSet's data shows. Platinum's current spot price is $1,004 an ounce, according to financial services company FactSet, which means that Costco's price is about 8% higher than the market value.

Title: The Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Over the Past 30 Years Might Surprise You
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/best-performing-s-and-p-500-stocks-8720206
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:01:59Z
Full Content:
When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks—those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings—these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed’s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home décor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a "treasure hunt"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 1,900 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1993 in Louisiana, Pool has steadily grown into one of the world’s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions, such as the purchase of South Central Pool Supply in the late 1990s, several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen’s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care—but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2022, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iPod in 2001, followed by the iTunes Store in 2003, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world’s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple’s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products—its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events—that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple’s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is "land light," contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through three key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics—focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture—helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola’s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2023, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world’s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon’s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world’s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon’s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2021, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company’s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company’s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia’s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company’s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of September 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), deliveringimpressive returns of 207%, 147%, and 120%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks—those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings—these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed’s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home décor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a "treasure hunt"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 1,900 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1993 in Louisiana, Pool has steadily grown into one of the world’s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions, such as the purchase of South Central Pool Supply in the late 1990s, several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen’s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care—but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2022, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iPod in 2001, followed by the iTunes Store in 2003, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media.

Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors.

There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of September 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), deliveringimpressive returns of 207%, 147%, and 120%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks—those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings—these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed’s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home décor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a "treasure hunt"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 1,900 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1993 in Louisiana, Pool has steadily grown into one of the world’s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions, such as the purchase of South Central Pool Supply in the late 1990s, several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen’s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care—but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2022, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iPod in 2001, followed by the iTunes Store in 2003, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world’s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple’s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products—its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events—that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple’s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is "land light," contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through three key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics—focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture—helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola’s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2023, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world’s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon’s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world’s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon’s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2021, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company’s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company’s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia’s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company’s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of September 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), deliveringimpressive returns of 207%, 147%, and 120%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth.

Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2022, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iPod in 2001, followed by the iTunes Store in 2003, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world’s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple’s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products—its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events—that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple’s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is "land light," contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through three key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics—focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture—helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola’s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2023, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world’s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon’s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world’s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon’s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2021, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company’s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company’s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia’s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company’s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of September 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), deliveringimpressive returns of 207%, 147%, and 120%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

Title: OpenAI will fall the hardest when the AI bubble bursts, analyst says
URL: https://qz.com/openai-multibillion-dollar-funding-chatgpt-ai-bubble-1851664344
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:01:00Z
Full Content:
OpenAI is now worth more than people were expecting. Wednesday, the artificial intelligence startup announced it had completed a $6.6 billion funding round, valuing it at $157 billion. The ChatGPT-maker’s raise is the largest private investment ever and puts OpenAI among the top three largest startups with venture backing, Bloomberg reported. Before the deal was finalized, OpenAI was expected to raise $6.5 billion in a round that would value it at $150 billion. “OpenAI needs follow-on funding to expand model training efforts and build proprietary products,” Brendan Burke, senior emerging technology analyst at PitchBook (MORN), said in a statement shared with Quartz. With the funding, OpenAI can keep up with its new competitor, xAI, which recently raised $6 billion, in building custom data centers, Burke said. He added that both multibillion-dollar raises show “the quantum of funding needed to remain competitive for frontier training efforts with the latest hardware.” However, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note after OpenAI’s raise that the startup “has capitalized on investors’ desperation to invest” in AI and set “very unusual terms that are yet another indication that AI remains in the midst of its 4th and largest bubble.” In OpenAI’s funding announcement, the company said ChatGPT has over 250 million users globally every week. The company said in September that it had reached one million paid business users, and an unnamed person told CNBC (CMCSA) the company has 11 million subscribers to ChatGPT Plus. In August, the startup’s monthly revenue reached $300 million — up 1,700% from the start of 2023, the New York Times (NYT) reported. OpenAI expects to end the year with $3.7 billion in annual sales, according to financial documents that reporters at the New York Times reviewed. The report also found that OpenAI expects $11.6 billion in revenue next year. According to PitchBook, the startup is “progressing toward $5 billion in annual recurring revenue,” mostly due to ChatGPT. Burke said OpenAI’s “revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believes the company can grow into.” But OpenAI’s revenue expectations will require its number of subscribers to grow by four times what it currently is, according to Windsor. “This is supposed to be achieved with no price erosion despite an increasingly bewildering number of competitors and Mark Zuckerberg’s contention that everyone is already ‘slashing prices’ to compete with Llama 3 priced at $0 per month,” Windsor said. In a note prior to the raise, Windsor said OpenAI “is no longer miles ahead of the competition,” and that with Meta’s (META) release of its flagship open-source Llama models, “the stage is set for rapid price erosion.” Another sign of a bubble, he said, is that free generative AI services are adding more features. “This is the pin that bursts the [AI] bubble in my opinion and given how much it has been inflated, there will be a significant correction to reality,” Windsor said. The startup also anticipates losing around $5 billion this year due to expenses such as running its AI models and paying employees, according to the New York Times’ review. But according to Windsor’s calculations, “ChatGPT+ should be hugely profitable by itself leading me to wonder where the rest of the money is going.” According to Windsor, the valuations of companies adjacent to generative AI, such as alternative energy startups and chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) — where Windsor said he sees most of the $6.6 billion raise likely going — “are far more reasonable and both will still perform well even if generative AI fails to live up to expectations.” Meanwhile, valuations of OpenAI and its competitors, who the startup has reportedly asked its investors not to back, “will only be able to defy gravity for so long” before a correction happens, Windsor said. According to Crunchbase, global venture funding for startups slowed in the third quarter of this year, but startups in the AI sector were at the top for investments. OpenAI’s new funding comes amid a spate of executive resignations and other governance issues, Windsor said, which means the startup will likely “fall the furthest and the hardest when the bubble eventually does burst.” OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the release of the company’s “reasoning” model, o1, and internal testing on frontier models “justifies continued investment in model development,” PitchBook also noted OpenAI’s executive departures, saying the company will likely evolve “with different executive leadership than that of the ChatGPT era.” According to PitchBook estimates, the generative AI software market is on track to double next year, exceeding $30 billion.

Title: Google Lens can now answer questions about videos

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Crunchboard Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Contact Us Google is upgrading its visual search app, Lens, with the ability to answer near-real-time questions about your surroundings. English-speaking Android and iOS users with the Google app installed can now start capturing a video via Lens and ask questions about objects of interest in the video. Lou Wang, director of product management for Lens, said the feature uses a “customized” Gemini model to make sense of the video and pertinent questions. Gemini is Google’s family of AI models and powers a number of products across the company’s portfolio. “Let’s say you want to learn more about some interesting fish,” Wang said in a press briefing. “[Lens will] produce an overview that explains why they’re swimming in a circle, along with more resources and helpful information.” To access Lens’ new video analysis feature, you must sign up for Google’s Search Labs program, as well as opt in to the “AI Overviews and more” experimental features in Labs. In the Google app, holding your smartphone’s shutter button activates Lens’ video-capturing mode. Ask a question while recording a video, and Lens will link out to an answer supplied by AI Overviews, the feature in Google Search that uses AI to summarize information from around the web. According to Wang, Lens uses AI to determine which frames in a video are most “interesting” and salient — and above all, relevant to the question being asked — and uses these to “ground” the answer from AI Overviews. “All this comes from an observation of how people are trying to use things like Lens right now,” Wang said. “If you lower the barrier of asking these questions and helping people satisfy their curiosity, people are going to pick this up pretty naturally.” The launch of video for Lens comes on the heels of a similar feature Meta previewed last month for its AR glasses, Ray-Ban Meta. Meta plans to bring real-time AI video capabilities to the glasses, letting wearers ask questions about what’s around them (e.g., “What type of flower is this?”). OpenAI has also teased a feature that lets its Advanced Voice Mode tool understand videos. Eventually, Advanced Voice Mode — a premium ChatGPT feature — will be able to analyze videos in real time and take context into account as it answers you. Google has beaten both companies to the punch, it seems — minus the fact that Lens is asynchronous (you can’t chat with it in real time), and assuming that the video feature works as advertised. We weren’t shown a live demo during the press briefing, and Google has a history of overpromising when it comes to its AI’s capabilities. Aside from video analysis, Lens can also now search with images and text in one go. English-speaking users, including those not enrolled in Labs, can launch the Google app and hold the shutter button to take a photo, then ask a question by speaking out loud. Finally, Lens is getting new e-commerce-specific functionality. Starting today, when Lens on Android or iOS recognizes a product, it’ll display information about it, including the price and deals, brand, reviews, and stock. Product ID works on uploaded and newly snapped photos (but not videos), and it is limited to select countries and certain shopping categories, including electronics, toys, and beauty, for now. “Let’s say you saw a backpack, and you like it,” Wang said. “You can use Lens to identify that product and you’ll be able to instantly see details you might be wondering about.” There’s an advertising component to this, too. The results page for Lens-identified products will also show “relevant” shopping ads with options and prices, Google says. Why stick ads in Lens? Because roughly 4 billion Lens searches each month are related to shopping, per Google. For a tech giant whose lifeblood is advertising, it’s simply too lucrative an opportunity to pass up.

In a rarity, SpaceX is bashing a key competitor, AST SpaceMobile, for allegedly spreading misinformation aimed at stopping the launch of SpaceX's cellular Starlink system. “AST and its investors continue their scorched-Earth campaign to hamstring competing direct-to-cellular operations,” the company told the FCC on Wednesday. In a letter, SpaceX derided AST SpaceMobile as a “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners out to slow progress on SpaceX’s cellular Starlink technology, which is aiming to launch a beta test with T-Mobile this fall. “Apparently not content with solely harming competition in America, AST is now taking its misinformation campaign overseas by recruiting its European investors and partners to parrot its talking points and harm competition there as well,” SpaceX claims. The company sent the letter after a group of European telecommunication providers warned the FCC they’d sue for damages if the commission loosens its rule for SpaceX and allows it to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond normal radio emission limits. The European telcos say they fear the cellular Starlink system will create radio interference with their own networks. But at least three of the European companies—Vodafone, Telefonica and Orange—are backers of AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing a cellular satellite service to beam internet data to phones. A beta test for AST SpaceMobile could kick off in December. AT&T and Verizon—two other AST backers—have also urged the FCC not to loosen its radio emission rules for the cellular Starlink technology. SpaceX is dismissing the opposition as an orchestrated lobbying campaign from AST. “The commission should not bow to AST’s investors’ and partners’ unfounded legal threats,” SpaceX said, later adding: “The commission should see through the anticompetitive advocacy of AST and its collection of investors and partners.” SpaceX is getting closer to commercially launching its cellular Starlink system, which currently spans over 200 satellites. But to reach its full potential, the company has asked the FCC for a waiver to operate the technology beyond the so-called “aggregate out-of-band emissions power flux-density limits.” Without it, SpaceX has warned the cellular Starlink system will struggle to power real-time video and voice calls, forcing the technology to settle for text-based messaging. It’s led to a growing regulatory battle over radio emission limits; it's unclear which way the FCC will rule. In the meantime, SpaceX insists its cellular Starlink technology is designed to prevent interference, citing its own technical studies. “Tellingly, just like AST investor AT&T’s specious advocacy, these AST supporters provide zero technical support for their opposition to SpaceX’s out-of-band emissions waiver,” the company tells the FCC. AST SpaceMobile—which has seen its stock value increase more than 500% over the last 12 months—didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But last month, company partner AT&T criticized SpaceX for trying to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. SpaceX "just need to follow the rules like everybody else.

Title: US Layoffs Up 53 Percent in September From Previous Year
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/us-layoffs-up-53-percent-in-september-from-previous-year-5734530
Time Published: 2024-10-03T15:54:19Z
Full Content:
Friends Read Free New data show that while employers handed out fewer pink slips in September than in August—when the number was at a five-month high—layoffs were up significantly compared to a year ago. According to recruitment firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, U.S.-based employers announced nearly 73,000 job cuts in September. While this was down by 4 percent from the previous month’s 75,891, the layoffs were up by 53 percent from last year. In the first nine months of 2024, personnel reductions rose by 0.8 percent year-over-year, to 609,242, surpassing in September the prior year’s running tally for the first time this year. This is the highest level since 2020, when more than 2 million layoffs were announced between January and September. Sizable portions of the year-to-date layoffs were centered in technology (116,858), entertainment and leisure (31,054), education (25,285), transportation (25,263), and manufacturing (19,794). These numbers have risen substantially from the same span in 2023. The Challenger report highlighted cost-cutting, business closures, and artificial intelligence as the top reasons for job cuts. “We’re at an inflection point now, where the labor market could stall or tighten,” said Andrew Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president. “Layoff announcements have risen over last year, and job openings are flat.” So far this year, employers have announced plans to hire close to 484,000 positions, down by 33 percent from 2023. Researchers say this is the lowest year-to-date hiring data since 2011. Labor market conditions could be stimulated in the coming months as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, and consumer spending is expected to rise, Challenger said. That said, layoffs continue to hit the headlines. Still, the JOLTS report showed an unexpected jump in job vacancies, topping 8 million for the first time since May. “This noisy indicator is starting to suggest a stabilization of the job market as the Fed pivots,” Adams stated in a note, as viewed via email by The Epoch Times. “Relatively few workers are being fired or laid off, and few are leaving jobs voluntarily for other opportunities, either.” Adams noted that the economy faces many near-term headwinds that will affect next month’s figures. “The impact of Helene and the strike also will likely affect October’s retail sales, industrial production, and jobless claims data, making the economy’s trend harder to tease out in the late fall months,” he said. Scores of retailers have been ramping up their seasonal hiring plans. Amazon, for example, announced on Oct. 3 that it will hire 250,000 workers for the year’s busiest shopping period. Last month, Target said it plans to hire about 100,000 seasonal employees. Macy’s said it will fill more than 31,500 full- and part-time seasonal positions. UPS aims to hire 125,000 seasonal workers ahead of Christmas. Companies are bracing for solid consumer demand. Sales for the 2024 Christmas shopping season are projected to increase by as much as 3.3 percent from 2023, according to Deloitte. Between November and January, holiday sales are expected to total $1.58 trillion to $1.59 trillion, Deloitte predicts. Adobe forecasts that e-commerce sales will hit a new record of just below $241 billion. The so-called Cyber Week (i.e., Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday) is predicted to account for one-fifth of online holiday sales. However, according to Adams, do not expect these jobs to be filled by many of those terminated by their companies this year. “Many of those who found themselves laid off this year from high-wage, high-skill roles, will not likely fill seasonal positions,” he said. Last year, the National Retail Federation, citing U.S. Census Bureau data, reported that core retail sales during the holiday season advanced by 3.8 percent over 2022, to an all-time high of $964.4 billion.

The Dow Jones dropped over 250 points on Thursday afternoon following the release of the latest jobless claims data, which showed a slight uptick. In addition to the labor data, persistent tensions in the Middle East and an ongoing port strike have fueled fears of inflationary pressures. According to data released by the Labor Department, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims rose to 225,000 for the week ending September 28, up from a revised figure of 219,000 the previous week. The increase slightly exceeded the expectations of economists, who had forecasted 222,000 claims. This report will be followed by the U.S. employment report on Friday, which includes key metrics such as the unemployment rate and changes in hourly wages, which will help gauge the overall health of the labor market. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 262 points, or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%. Oil prices continued to rise as West Texas Intermediate and Brent surged nearly 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively, in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly to 3.8%. Despite the decline across major indexes, AI stocks surged on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) were among the top-performing stocks.

Title: Charging ahead: Key reasons for confidence in a commercial EV trucking future

Published: October 3, 2024 by Maaz Haider As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the impacts of climate change have become a tangible concern for millions of people. Among the largest contributors to this crisis is transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have an outsized impact. Hence, reducing transportation emissions is essential. Transitioning to zero-emission trucks will slash climate and air pollution everywhere, improve local economies by creating new jobs, strengthen national security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, and save fleets money on fuel – all of which are especially critical now. While certain trucking entities have concerns about the viability of commercial electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., this presents an opportunity for innovative partnerships. By working together to address these challenges, we can accelerate the transition to zero-emission trucks and reinforce the transportation sector’s commitment to a sustainable future. The industry has made significant strides in developing charging infrastructure to support electric trucks. Private investment, as well as support from government programs, is beginning to address the infrastructure challenge. Fueled by public and private funds, there are now around 183,000 public charging ports in operation within the U.S. as of Q2 2024–well on target to meet Biden’s administration goal of half a million public ports by 2030. The funds allocated under the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and the Charging & Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grants program are actively being awarded and implemented. Three charging sites in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are already operational under NEVI, with 47 additional projects announced under CFI, which will deploy over 5,000 Level 2 chargers and more than 600 Level 3 fast chargers. Efforts led by other private groups solidify the future of public charging in the country. Notably, Forum Mobility will be deploying 1,000 DC fast chargers in California. Furthermore, Greenlane, a partnership between Daimler, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, to develop a nationwide network of high-performance charging stations starting with a 280-mile corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Recently, a group of carriers and shippers, which includes AIT Worldwide, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, PepsiCo, and others, have formed a coalition to pilot heavy-duty charging with Terawatt Infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. Advancements in battery technology are beginning to alleviate unfounded concerns from skeptics that site range anxiety remains a significant barrier to EV adoption in the commercial sector. Companies, including legacy manufacturers and new entrants like Daimler, Freightliner, Nikola, Tesla, and Windrose are leading the way with trucks that offer impressive ranges on a single charge. Tesla’s Semi truck promises a range of up to 500 miles with PepsiCo, one of the early adopters of the Semi, having successfully integrated these trucks into its fleet for regional distribution. Real-world data from Pepsi’s deployment has successfully accomplished a 1000+ mile journey in a single day, surpassing performance expectations and highlighting the vehicle’s long-range capabilities and efficiency. Another new entrant in the market is Windrose with their EV trucks offering upwards of a 400-mile range at full load. As per the Zero-Emissions Technology Inventory (ZETI) tool there are currently 21 different OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) offering 24 different EV van and truck models with a range of 200+ miles. While the sticker price of electric trucks is higher compared to traditional diesel trucks, as per BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2024, due to battery cost reduction and efficiency improvements, zero-emission trucks’ cost parity can be reached even sooner with the urban duty cycle becoming cost competitive before 2030. Furthermore, subsidies and tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act and public grants can help offset the upfront capital costs. Specifically, IRA provision 45W allows fleets to reduce the cost of an electric truck by up to $40,000, while provision 30C enables savings of up to 30% on the cost of installing charging infrastructure. Moreover, the total cost of ownership (TCO) savings outlook for electric trucks is further amplified due to savings on fuel and maintenance. Titan Freight Systems demonstrated these cost savings for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in a presentation at the ACT Expo 2024 showcasing 10% and 7% savings in these applications respectively. The savings will increase as more EVs are deployed since the cost of existing charging infrastructure will be spread across a larger fleet The growth of EVs and charging infrastructure in the U.S. can be likened to the growth of a bamboo shoot. After years growing deep roots with little visible growth above ground, bamboo suddenly shoots up rapidly, symbolizing how foundational work leads to swift, visible progress. Similarly, the EV industry initially experienced slow adoption, focused on building the necessary technology, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness. However, with these strong foundations now in place, thanks to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, NEVI, and other initiatives, the industry is experiencing rapid growth, much like bamboo’s sudden upward shoot. The EV industry’s steady groundwork is enabling companies in the U.S. to quickly expand their EV truck fleets, making significant strides toward sustainable transportation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding at a $157 billion valuation—more than the market caps of companies like Uber Technologies (UBER) and Lowe's (LOW). The latest funding values the startup behind ChatGPT at nearly double the $86 billion it reportedly was valued at early this year. "The new funding will allow us to double down on our leadership in frontier AI research, increase compute capacity, and continue building tools that help people solve hard problems," the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company said. OpenAI didn't disclose the investors but according to The Wall Street Journal, venture capital firm Thrive Capital led the funding round, which also included Microsoft, AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank, and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management. Investors in the funding round will have the right to pull out their cash if OpenAI doesn't convert into a for-profit firm within two years, according to the Journal. The company reportedly told the investors it doesn't want them to invest in its largest private rivals, including Elon Musk's xAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. OpenAI didn't immediately return an Investopedia request for comment.

Title: Bitcoin advances timeline to replace fiat as the global reserve currency

Mounting global debt and technological advances push Bitcoin closer to mainstream integration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Four years on from the start of the COVID-induced global financial crisis, the global economy stands at a pivotal moment, characterized by moderate inflation and low unemployment yet overshadowed by uneven growth and escalating debt in advanced economies. Recent data from the G20 nations paint a complex picture of economic health, raising questions about the long-term viability of the fiat system and the potential rise of Bitcoin as a financial necessity. Inflation rates have generally stabilized in advanced economies. The Euro Area reports an inflation rate of 1.8%, the United States sits at 2.5%, and the United Kingdom holds steady at 2.2%, all hovering near central bank targets. These figures suggest effective monetary policies are maintaining price stability without severely restricting economic activity. However, stark contrasts exist in emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey, grappling with hyperinflation rates of 237% and 49.38%, respectively. Traditional monetary interventions in these countries have struggled to contain soaring prices, eroding public confidence in fiat currencies. Global interest rates further illustrate the divergent economic strategies. The United States and the Euro Area have reduced rates to 5% and 3.65%, respectively, aiming to stimulate growth amid signs of slowing economies. Japan continues its long-standing ultra-low rate policy at 0.25%. Conversely, Argentina and Turkey have instituted exorbitantly high rates of 40% and 50% in attempts to rein in inflation, highlighting the limitations of conventional fiscal tools under extreme conditions. Economic growth is uneven across the globe. The United States shows robust GDP growth at 3%, bolstered by solid consumer spending and investment. Indonesia leads with a remarkable 3.79%, showcasing the vitality of specific emerging markets. In contrast, Germany and South Korea face slight contractions of -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, signaling potential structural issues and vulnerabilities to external shocks. Unemployment rates in advanced economies remain low, with Japan at 2.5%, the United States at 4.2%, and the United Kingdom at 4.1%. These tight labor markets could exert upward pressure on wages, potentially reigniting inflation if not carefully managed. Meanwhile, South Africa’s unemployment rate remains distressingly high at 33.5%, and Spain’s at 11.27%, reflecting persistent structural challenges requiring comprehensive policy responses. Critically, government debt levels raise critical concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is alarming at 255%, the United States’ at 122%, and Italy’s at 135%. While current low interest rates make these debt levels manageable, any significant economic downturn or increase in borrowing costs could exacerbate fiscal pressures, undermining confidence in fiat currencies. Against this backdrop, the concept of hyperbitcoinization—the point at which Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant form of money (or value) —gains relevance. Quantitatively, the timeline can be envisaged in phases: Analyzing current economic indicators places us in the early to middle stages of Phase 2. The global fiat system, while functional, exhibits signs of strain from high debt burdens and uneven economic performance. Central banks have thus far maintained control over inflation and liquidity, but the persistent challenges highlight the gradual materialization of conditions conducive to accelerated Bitcoin adoption. Economic disparities, high debt levels, and the diminishing returns of traditional monetary policies in certain regions are increasingly challenging the stability of the global fiat system. While we are not yet at a point where Bitcoin is a required replacement for fiat currencies, current trends suggest a gradual shift toward its broader adoption. As economic pressures intensify and technological and regulatory landscapes evolve, Bitcoin’s role could transition from an alternative asset to a necessary component of the global financial architecture. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin will move closer to necessity in the hyperbitcoinization timeline. CryptoSlate will continue to monitor economic indicators, policy responses, and technological progress to provide clearer insights into this potential paradigm shift.

Title: UBER shares up 12% since last results, outperforming peers DASH and LYFT, says Wolfe Research analyst

On Thursday, Wolfe Research reiterated its Outperform rating on Uber Technologies Inc . (NYSE:UBER) with a steady price target of $95.00. The firm's positive stance on the ride-hailing giant is attributed to Uber's robust competitive edge and consistent fundamental performance. The company is recognized for its sustained demand for core services and expansion into new categories, products, and markets, all while enhancing profitability and repurchasing shares. Uber's valuation, according to Wolfe Research, is justified by a 25 times multiple on the forecasted 2025 price to free cash flow (P/FCF), a figure aligned with its peer DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) Inc., despite Uber's larger scale and stronger free cash flow profile. The target multiple also matches the average for tech megacaps like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Wolfe Research emphasizes free cash flow as the key valuation metric, considering it a reliable indicator of Uber's transition to earnings and ability to return capital to shareholders. Since the last earnings report on August 6, Uber's stock has seen an increase of 12%, which is observed in the context of its competitors DoorDash and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., which have experienced gains of 17% and 14%, respectively. This performance is also compared to a 9.5% rise in the Nasdaq index during the same period. Uber's consistent demand for its primary offerings and strategic moves into new verticals and geographical areas are seen as growth drivers. The company's focus on improving its profitability alongside its share buyback program is also highlighted as a contributor to its positive outlook. The reaffirmed price target of $95 by Wolfe Research reflects confidence in Uber's business model and its ability to maintain a strong position in the competitive landscape of ride-sharing and delivery services. Uber's financial strategies and market expansions are key factors in Wolfe Research's assessment of the company's future performance. In other recent news, Uber Technologies has been in the spotlight with several key developments. TD Cowen maintained a Buy rating on Uber shares, emphasizing the potential impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology on Uber's business model. The firm suggests that the deployment of lower-cost AVs is crucial for the technology to be economically viable and scalable. Uber has also been active in the autonomous vehicle sector, partnering with Chinese firm WeRide to launch robotaxis in the United Arab Emirates in 2024. This initiative, along with Uber's expanded partnership with Alphabet's Waymo, reflects the company's commitment to incorporate autonomous vehicles into its service offerings. Analysts at Oppenheimer and KeyBanc have both increased their price targets for Uber, citing growth prospects in delivery services and operational efficiency. Oppenheimer's survey revealed a positive outlook for Uber's restaurant and grocery delivery services, indicating potential for increased order frequency among current users. KeyBanc highlighted Uber's potential for EBITDA growth driven by operational efficiencies. Uber has also formed a delivery partnership with Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), aiming to meet growing customer demand for home delivery options. This collaboration is set to begin at select Olive Garden locations in late 2024. Finally, BTIG maintained its Buy rating on Uber, emphasizing the company's consistent growth in the rideshare and delivery sectors. This analysis supports Uber's third-quarter guidance of 18-23% growth, potentially marking the fifth consecutive quarter with a growth rate of 20% or better. Complementing Wolfe Research's bullish outlook on Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER), recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to the company's financial performance and market position. Uber's market capitalization stands at an impressive $153.1 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the ground transportation industry. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Uber's net income is expected to grow this year, aligning with Wolfe Research's positive stance on the company's profitability trajectory. This growth expectation is further supported by the fact that three analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating growing confidence in Uber's financial performance. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $40.06 billion, with a solid revenue growth of 14.44% over the same period. This robust top-line performance underscores Uber's ability to expand its market presence and capitalize on the growing demand for its services, as noted in the article. Investors should note that Uber is trading at a high P/E ratio of 75.19, which may seem elevated but could be justified by its strong growth prospects and market leadership. An InvestingPro Tip suggests that Uber is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, potentially indicating an attractive entry point for long-term investors. For those interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips on Uber, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: CFTC Subcommittee Sends Up Recommendations for Letting Firms Use Tokenized Shares as Collateral: Bloomberg

Election 2024 coverage presented by The likes of BlackRock and Franklin Templeton could see tokenized shares of their money-market funds pledged in trading after a major group under the aegis of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved guidelines for their use, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. A subcommittee of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee voted to pass the recommendations on to the full committee, which is expected to vote on the recommendations later this year, the report said citing two people familiar with the matter. The report did not reveal what the recommendations were but the mere action that they have been sent to the full committee could be seen as the next step. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is an example of how creating blockchain-based tokens of traditional investments such as bonds and funds is a fast-growing use case for the larger digital asset space. The BUIDL fund became the largest tokenized Treasury fund just six weeks after its late launch in March. It surpassed $500 million market value in July. The CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee includes BlackRock and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, the report said.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels After CEO Cites "Insane" Demand for AI Chips

Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) shares will remain in the spotlight Thursday after CEO Jensen Huang said during a CNBC interview late yesterday that demand for the company’s next generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips is “insane.” The AI darling also announced an expanded partnership with IT consulting firm Accenture (ACN). The chipmaker’s stock, which has gained 140% so far this year and helped fuel a broader rally in the S&P 500, continues to surpass Wall Street’s lofty expectations amid insatiable demand for its silicon as companies and governments invest heavily in AI infrastructure to power the technology. The stock was up 1.4% at $120.50 in premarket trading Thursday about two hours before the opening bell. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels to focus on. After topping out in late June, Nvidia shares have oscillated within a symmetrical triangle, a chart pattern that indicates a period of consolidation, typically followed by a new trending move in the direction of a breakout and longer-term trend, which in Nvidia’s case, signals further bullish price momentum. Indeed, If the stock moves above the triangle, with above-average trading volume confirming the breakout, investors can determine two potential upside price targets using the measuring principle and a bars pattern. To forecast a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For example, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target in the shares of $180. We can also use a bars pattern, which analyzes a prior trending move to predict a future directional move, assuming price patterns tend to rhyme. To use the technique on Nvidia’s chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from January to March and reposition it from this week’s low. Doing so forecasts an upside target of about $210, around 77% above Wednesday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier symmetrical triangle, offering investors insight how a trend higher from the current pattern may potentially play out. Despite the bullish technicals on Nvidia’s chart it’s also worth keeping a key breakdown area in mind given the stock’s history of significant price fluctuations. That level sits around $97, a region likely to attract support near a trendline linking the twin March peaks with the upward sloping 200-day moving average.

Title: BlackRock finalizes $500 million Recurrent Energy stake
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/blackrock-finalizes-500-million-recurrent-energy-stake-93CH-3646903
Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:12:46Z

NEW YORK - Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:CSIQ) announced the completion of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s $500 million investment in its subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, which was initially disclosed in January 2024. The final tranche of the investment was received this week, following an initial payment in June 2024. This investment gives BlackRock a 20% stake in Recurrent Energy on a fully diluted as-converted basis, with Canadian Solar retaining the majority share. Recurrent Energy is set to leverage the new capital to expand its project development portfolio, transitioning from solely developing projects to also owning and operating them, particularly in the U.S. and European markets. This strategic move aims to secure more stable long-term revenue streams in low-risk currencies and to extract greater value from its global project pipeline. The company, established in 2009, has developed, built, and connected over 11 gigawatts of utility-scale solar projects and 3.7 gigawatt hours of energy storage projects across six continents. Recurrent Energy's CEO, Ismael Guerrero, expressed confidence that the partnership with BlackRock reinforces their position in the renewable energy sector and underpins their commitment to delivering clean and affordable power. David Giordano, Global Head of Climate Infrastructure at BlackRock, echoed Guerrero's sentiments, highlighting the opportunity for Recurrent Energy to accelerate the growth of its solar and battery storage projects with the support of BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure Global Renewable Power Fund IV. The transaction is expected to bolster Recurrent Energy's capabilities in developing and managing utility-scale solar and energy storage projects worldwide. The company currently has more than 26 GWp of solar and 56 GWh of battery storage projects under development. This news is based on a press release statement and further details regarding the investment can be found in Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 23, 2024. In other recent news, Canadian Solar Inc. has experienced a series of financial adjustments following its second-quarter results. Roth/MKM reduced its price target for the company to $20, maintaining a Buy rating, while JPMorgan lowered its target to $14, keeping an Underweight rating. Both adjustments were influenced by a mixed financial performance, including a miss on earnings per share but alignment with consensus on revenue and gross margin figures. The company's second quarter was robust, with solar module shipments reaching 8.2 gigawatts and revenues hitting $1.6 billion. Its gross margin stood at 17.2%, showcasing the strength of the company's position in the clean energy market. Despite challenges such as global module pricing weakness and potential increased trade barriers, Canadian Solar's diversified business model, particularly its rapidly expanding energy storage segment, is expected to contribute to future growth. Recent developments also indicate that the company's third-quarter revenue and gross margin guidance fell short of expectations, leading to a downward revision of its full-year 2024 revenue guidance. However, despite these challenges, Canadian Solar's U.S. operations are meeting internal expectations with steady pricing, reflecting the company's proactive risk-sharing strategy against potential new anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. These are recent developments in the company's performance and outlook. As Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: CSIQ) moves forward with its strategic investment from BlackRock, investors should consider some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that shed light on the company's current position. Despite the recent positive news, InvestingPro data reveals that Canadian Solar's revenue growth has been negative, with a -18.28% decline in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year. The company's efforts to expand its project development portfolio through Recurrent Energy could be seen as a strategic move to counteract this trend. On a more positive note, Canadian Solar has shown a strong return over the last month, with a 27.84% price total return. This recent performance might reflect market optimism about the BlackRock investment and the company's future prospects in the renewable energy sector. It's worth noting that Canadian Solar operates with a significant debt burden, according to an InvestingPro Tip. This could explain the company's decision to seek external investment to fuel its growth plans. The infusion of $500 million from BlackRock may help alleviate some financial pressure and provide the necessary capital for expansion. For investors considering Canadian Solar's valuation, the company is trading at a low Price / Book multiple of 0.39, which could indicate potential undervaluation. However, this should be weighed against the company's financial challenges and growth prospects. InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Canadian Solar, providing a more comprehensive analysis for investors interested in delving deeper into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: CFTC to introduce tokenized funds – How will it impact financial markets?

Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:00:38Z

Here’s a look at how the adoption of tokenized collateral could impact financial markets. In a significant move aimed at enhancing portfolio diversification for investors and streamlining capital efficiency for fund managers, a subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has advanced its recommendations on the application of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in managing non-cash collateral. These guidelines, which focus on enabling registered firms to leverage DLT for holding and transferring tokenized assets, mark a critical step toward integrating blockchain solutions within traditional financial infrastructure. The recommendations have been passed to the full committee for further review. The initiative gained traction following reports by Bloomberg on the 2nd of October. This highlights the push to utilize tokenized shares of money-market funds from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton as collateral in trading activities. For those unfamiliar, the subcommittee pushing these advancements includes influential members like Citadel, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg LP, further underscoring the momentum behind tokenization in traditional financial sectors. That being said, if approved by the full committee later this year, the proposed recommendations could substantially drive the adoption of tokenized collateral within financial markets, offering companies enhanced capital efficiency in their operations. Notably, this development would benefit BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, two leading players in the tokenized U.S. treasuries space. For those unaware, BUIDL, according to data from rwa.xyz, dominates the market with over $518 million in tokenized assets, while FOBXX holds a significant share of $435 million. Together, these two funds represent nearly half of the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. treasuries market. Therefore, if the recommendations gain full approval, the use of tokenized collateral is expected to expand, with more businesses seeking capital efficiencies through tokenization. Remarking on the same, McKinsey in a recent report released on the 20th of June, noted, “Based on our analysis, we expect that total tokenized market capitalization could reach around $2 trillion by 2030, driven by adoption in mutual funds, bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETN), loans and securitization, and alternative funds.” They further added, “In a bullish scenario, this value could double to around $4 trillion, but we are less optimistic than previously published estimates as we approach the middle of the decade.” As expected, some firms, such as crypto prime brokers Hidden Road and FalconX, are already leveraging BlackRock’s BUIDL token as collateral. This highlights the growing adoption of tokenized assets in the financial sector. Aave recently proposed the GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the 26th of August, aimed at utilizing BUIDL shares to maintain its stablecoin peg to the US dollar. Similarly, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed plans for a new stablecoin, UStb, fully backed by BUIDL.

Title: What office meltdown? Developers see a shortage of high-end space and are rushing to build it.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/office-construction-demand-upcoming-shortage-real-estate-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:00:02Z
Full Content:
Office vacancy is at a record high in Washington, DC, and the city is regarded as one of the nation's most challenged markets — in part because of its heavy reliance on federal tenants that have continued to slim down their spaces. Yet Hilary Goldfarb, a senior managing director at Rockefeller Group who leads the company's Washington operations, has little doubt about the sleek 400,000-square-foot office property her firm is raising at 600 Fifth St. When the building is completed in mid-2026, Goldfarb said, she is "confident it will be full." "This is not hope as a strategy," she added, adding that half the project was pre-leased to the law firm Crowell & Moring. "It's based on real data and real activity," she said. Across the country, major office markets from New York to San Francisco have been pummeled by the lasting popularity of remote and hybrid work. Newly built, high-end offices, however, are finding takers. That demand has persisted even as office construction has been stifled by higher interest rates and inflation, which have pushed up building costs. Worries over the health of the office market have also made lenders reluctant to finance new development. About 30 million square feet of new office space is expected to be completed this year in the US, roughly half of what was built in 2019, before the pandemic, CBRE, a real-estate services firm, said. It projected deliveries would fall even further in 2025, to 14 million square feet. While the overall office market is awash in hundreds of millions of square feet of empty space, CBRE predicted that vacancy in the market's upper segment would drop to pre-pandemic levels by 2027 — about the same time projects that are breaking ground now are set to be ready. A growing number of office developers have taken notice and see a budding shortage they are eager to cater to. Large-office tenants, who often plan their space decisions years in advance, have also begun to recognize that while space options may abound now, they're likely to vanish in the coming years — raising interest in new development. "The last six, seven months, there's not just people coming kicking the tires; there's people that are really looking to engage," Scott Rechler, the CEO of RXR, said. He was referring to what he said was growing tenant interest in 175 Park Ave., a 2.8-million-square-foot skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill that the developers RXR and TF Cornerstone are planning next to Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. The group now aims to begin construction on the more than $4 billion 1,575-foot-tall tower midway through 2025 and with significantly less pre-leasing than originally planned because of its growing confidence in demand. Asking rents at the tower are set to be above $200 per square foot, among the highest ever sought in New York City. "There used to be a point where we thought we would need to pre-lease all of it," Rechler said. "Now, we think that at 500,000 feet, it's probably enough to get going." Rechler said that interest in elite new space had been stoked by other high-end offerings in the market, such as One Vanderbilt, a recently built nearby tower, JPMorgan's new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., and a planned skyscraper at 350 Park Ave., which will house the investment firm Citadel. "If your competitors have a building like that that they're identified with and you're trying to be on a parallel path, you're going to say I want to be in a space at the same level or better," Rechler said. The large development firm Related Cos., meanwhile, says that four office towers it has built with Oxford Properties as part of their Hudson Yards megaproject are 99% full. The team is readying to begin a new 45-story 1.1 million-square-foot office property called 70 Hudson Yards next year. "We think we're going to be one of the only new buildings in '27, '28 when there's going to be no new supply," Philippe Visser, Related's president of office development, said. Even as overall office vacancy is at 15.1% in Manhattan, according to CBRE, Visser sees little competition between the overwhelming majority of that empty space and Hudson Yards, where a number of major corporate names have migrated in recent years to take occupancy of newly built buildings. Tenants include Wells Fargo, KKR, BlackRock, Meta, and L'Oréal. "All these successful companies who are looking for really dynamic office space want new construction," Visser said. The 70 Hudson Yards building is set to have various state-of-the-art features, including a triple-paned glass facade, which greatly enhances the insulating properties of glass exteriors and will make the building more energy-efficient and appealing to sustainability-conscious office users. In lower Manhattan, Larry Silverstein hinted that he's close to moving ahead with plans to erect the final office skyscraper at the World Trade Center, a 2.8 million-square-foot tower designed by the architect Norman Foster. Rumors abound that Silverstein is close to signing a large lease with American Express that would allow the project to proceed. "Just stay tuned" was all Silverstein would say about the possibility of a deal at the tower, 2 World Trade Center. He said he was certain other tenants would fill up the remainder of the building's available space once construction was underway. "When you put everything this building has all together, it's superior," Silverstein said. "It never left my mind that someday we would succeed in accomplishing tower two — and that's where we are today." Manhattan is particularly conducive to new construction because it has both a large captive audience of corporate-office users and a deep inventory of old, outdated office properties that have fallen out of favor. But because there's so little office construction on the horizon nationally, builders have begun to lay similar plans in other markets with similar dynamics. Visser, for instance, said Related expected to break ground on a 40-story 925,000-square-foot office tower at 725 W. Randolph St. in Chicago by next year. While that city is also awash in available space, the building would be one of the only available newly built office properties in the Fulton Market neighborhood, a desirable subdistrict in the city's West Loop known for its retail and restaurants, he said. Related Ross, a spinoff development firm launched earlier this year by Related's founder, Stephen Ross, is about to begin construction on 15 CityPlace, a nearly 500,000-square-foot office building in West Palm Beach, Florida. The project is about 70% pre-leased to an undisclosed roster of tenants, according to Jordan Rathlev, a senior vice president of development at the company. Rathlev said he recently received a space inquiry from a financial-technology firm that's seeking at least 300,000 square feet — far more than 15 CityPlace can accommodate. The interest from that tenant and others has given a boost to the company's ambitions to begin building a neighboring office property called 10 CityPlace that would also be about 500,000 square feet. "The intent is that they're both going at the same time," Rathlev said, indicating Related's hope that it will sign enough anchor tenancy at 10 CityPlace to build it and 15 CityPlace simultaneously. There is a yawning gap between the health of top-tier office space and the wider market, according to data from CBRE. The firm labels new and heavily renovated spaces that meet a host of quality measures as "prime" — a segment that encompasses only 8% of overall office inventory nationally. A net total of 49.3 million square feet of prime space was absorbed between 2020 and the first quarter of 2024, according to CBRE. About 170.3 million square feet of net vacancy accrued in the rest of the office market during that same period. Overall office vacancy nationally was 19.1% in June, close to a record level. Prime vacancy was 15.5%, and CBRE forecast that figure would drop by almost half, to 8.2% by 2027, its pre-pandemic average. "We believe that this absorption estimate is conservative and the prime vacancy rate could return to its pre-pandemic level sooner given continued job growth," Jessica Morin, CBRE's director of US office research, said. These top-of-the-market spaces, which charged a 60% premium before the pandemic, are 84% more expensive than competing spaces. With little supply, that differential could grow. Morin said: "8.2% is a healthy prime market and we expect rent growth in this tranche." Driving the solid metrics is a lack of new supply. While a total of 44 million square feet of office space is under construction, only about 17.3 million square feet of it, 39% of the total, is considered prime, according to CBRE. Eight million square feet of that is pre-leased, meaning that there is only about 10 million square feet of upcoming available top-quality space. Even with the tailwinds, financing high-end office construction remains a challenge. Banks have grown wary of lending to office projects, even those that are likely to be a financial success, because of broader concerns around declining values, increased foreclosures, and the potential for financial losses in the sector. As a result, Rechler said, RXR is considering "alternative strategies" to arrange financing for 175 Park Ave. "The scale of this project is of a level — I'm not sure you'd be able to get enough traditional banks, as an example, to be a lender," Rechler said. Rechler added that RXR had explored other routes to arrange the billions of dollars of debt necessary to fund 175 Park Ave.'s construction, including the municipal-bond market, in part because the project includes $500 million of transit upgrades to Grand Central Terminal. "I feel good," Rechler said, "that we'll have the right combination of pre-leasing and financing to begin next year." Jump to

Title: LVMH Strikes Landmark 10-Year Global Partnership with Formula 1

The deal brings brands like Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, and TAG Heuer into the global motorsport arena, marking a new chapter for LVMH and Formula 1. LVMH will be the official Global Partner of Formula 1 from 2025, in a landmark 10-year deal announced this week. The world’s largest luxury group has a number of relevant brands here, the group’s press release making special mention of Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy and TAG Heuer. This news is almost not newsworthy at all anymore because it has been gristle-clogging up the rumor meat processor for some months now. However, this remains one of the biggest news items in the world of luxury, if for nothing other than its sheer scale. The consensus on the value of the deal (undisclosed by LVMH or F1) is estimated at between USD 100 to USD 150 million a year, which only counts as small potatoes if you are BlackRock. Read More: LVMH’s L’Epée Acquisition Hints at Broader Strategy in Luxury Horology For some context, the LVMH group clocked revenues of EU86.15 billion in FY23, with a net income of EUR 15.17 billion. If the F1 deal had been in place then, net income would have been lower to the tune of 0.15 billion. To put it another way, any cost that is visible from this kind of cursory top-down look will make shareholders groan and reach for their Moët; we recommend the Dom Perignon 2003 vintage, in the David Lynch limited edition, if possible. So, what does LVMH gain from this? Details are about as scant as what is known of the activities of the Arnault family office but here is what the big guns said in the presser: “The people, the quest for excellence and the passion for innovation are at the heart of the activity of our Maisons and Formula 1,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO, of LVMH Group. “In motorsport as in fashion, watchmaking or wines and spirits, every detail counts on the path to success. Both in our workshops and on circuits around the world, it is this incessant search to break boundaries that inspires our vision, and this is the meaning that we want to bring to this great and unique partnership between Formula 1 and our Group.” Read More: New Frontiers: What to Expect from Julien Tornare at Hublot “In recent years, Formula 1 has truly become one of the most desirable sports in the world,” said Frédéric Arnault, CEO, of LVMH Watches. “It’s a vibrant discipline that echoes a number of values that are very important to us, such as innovation, team spirit and performance. For many years, several of our Maisons have also chosen to invest in Formula 1, whether to create unique experiences or for moments of celebration. With our Maisons and the expertise of our Group, we want to further grow this experiential dimension that Formula 1 provides all over the world. We are only at the very beginning of this partnership, but the seasons that await us promise to be extraordinary.” Read More: Frédéric Arnault’s Appointment Alerts Growing Importance of LVMH Watches The prominence of the younger Arnault in the reporting on this story across the board seems to indicate the degree of his involvement. In fact, he has been vocal in the past of the importance of Formula 1 to TAG Heuer in particular (when he was CEO of that brand) and was very public in his ambition to return the brand to pole position in the sport; TAG Heuer is currently partnering with the Red Bull Formula 1 team, which has been pretty good for the brand. Our retail friends in Singapore tell us that TAG Heuer typically sees a sales boost from racing season, and we have no reason to doubt this. Read More: TAG Heuer’s “Extreme” Ways On the other hand, a deal as massive as a global partnership is probably too big for TAG Heuer to swallow, without a bit of Moët to wash it down and Louis Vuitton to sew it all up; Morgan Stanley estimates TAG Heuer’s revenue at under USD 800 million in the last FY. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that this is not LVMH’s first rodeo. Most famously, Moët & Chandon was the champagne of record for the podium celebrations for years, and it was once synonymous with Formula 1. We have heard from industry insiders that champagne’s biggest name withdrew from the races because, well, they just used too much inventory. Read More: Could LVMH’s CEO Reshuffle Be The Key to Higher Long-Term Revenues? And then there is the matter of what role Louis Vuitton will play, as it surely must do. While it is fun to imagine all the drivers kitted out in Louis Vuitton flame-retardant suits, this is extremely unlikely. The story is still developing so we will return with more updates once they are confirmed. For more on the latest in luxury and motoring click here.

In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this week, Siemiatkowski said that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options — a common form of equity compensation tech firms offer to their staff — could lead to Klarna losing talent to technology giants in the U.S. such as Google, Apple and Meta. As Klarna — which is known for its popular buy now, pay later installment plans — prepares for its IPO, the lack of attractiveness of Europe as a place for the best and brightest to work has become a much more prominent fear, Siemiatkowski told CNBC. "When we looked at the risks of the IPO, which is a number one risk in my opinion? Our compensation," said Siemiatkowski, who is approaching his 20th year as CEO of the financial technology firm. He was referring to company risk factors, which are a common element of IPO prospectus filings. Compared to a basket of its publicly-listed peers, Klarna offers only a fifth of its equity as a share of its revenue, according to a study obtained by CNBC which the company paid consulting firm Compensia to produce. However, the study also showed that Klarna's publicly-listed peers offer six times the amount of equity that it does. Siemiatkowski said there a number of hurdles blocking Klarna and its European tech peers from offering employees in the region more favorable employee stock option plans, including costs that erode the value of shares they are granted when they join. In the U.K. and Sweden, he explained that employee social security payments deducted from their stock rewards are "uncapped," meaning that staff at companies in these countries stand to lose more than people at firms in, say, Germany and Italy where there are concrete caps in place. The higher a firm's stock price, the more it must pay toward employees' social benefits, making it difficult for companies to plan expenses effectively. Britain and Sweden also calculate social benefits on the actual value of employees' equity upon sale in liquidity events like an IPO. "It's not that companies are not willing to pay that," Siemiatkowski said. "The biggest issue is the lack of predictability. If a staff cost is entirely associated with my stock price, and that has implications on my PNL [profit and loss] ... it has cost implications for the company. It makes it impossible to plan." In the past year, Siemiatkowski has more clearly signalled Klarna's ambitions to go public soon. In an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell," he said that a 2024 listing was "not impossible." In August, Bloomberg reported Klarna was close to selecting Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriter for its IPO in 2025. Siemiatkowski declined to comment on where the company will go public and said nothing has been confirmed yet on timing. Still, when it does go public, Klarna will be among the first major fintech names to successfully debut on a stock exchange in several years. Affirm, one of Klarna's closest competitors in the U.S., went public in 2021. Afterpay, another Klarna competitor, was acquired by Jack Dorsey's payments company Block in 2021 for $29 billion. A study by venture capital firm Index Ventures last year found that, on average, employees at late-stage European startups own around 10% of the companies they work for, compared to 20% in the U.S. Out of a selection of 24 countries, the U.K. ranks highly overall. However, it does a poorer job when it comes to the administration burdens associated with treatment of these plans. Sweden, meanwhile, fares worse, performing badly on factors such as the scope of the plans and strike price, the Index study said. Asked whether he's worried Klarna employees may look to leave the company for an American tech firm instead, Siemiakowski said it's a "risk," particularly as the firm is expanding aggressively in the U.S. "The more prominent we become in the U.S market, the more people see us and recognize us — and the more their LinkedIn inbox is going to be pinged by offers from others," Siemiatkowski told CNBC. He added that, in Europe, there's "unfortunately a sentiment that you shouldn't pay that much to really talented people," especially when it comes to people working in the financial services industry. "There is more of that sentiment than in the U.S., and that is unfortunately hurting competitiveness," Klarna's co-founder said. "If you get approached by Google, they will fix your visa. They will transfer you to the U.S. These issues that used to be there, they're not there anymore." "The most talented pool is very mobile today," he added, noting that its now easier for staff to work remotely from a region that's outside a company's physical office space.

Title: Bitcoin Down To $60,000: Did Q4 2024 Lows Just Print?

Bitcoin is down at writing, slipping roughly 8% from September highs. After two days of losses, BTC is starting Q4 2024 on the wrong footing, with the real risk of prices sliding below $60,000 and back to September and August lows. One analyst on X is optimistic about the world’s most valuable coin, which is flat and hanging by a thread. In a post, the analyst said the recent setback should be seen positively. Moreover, the trader continued, Bitcoin, even with the pain holders faced in early October 2024, is likely printing Q4 2024. According to the analyst’s preview, Bitcoin tends to establish swing highs or lows early in the trading period, in this case, for Q4 2024. Although the escalations in the Middle East are disruptive, Bitcoin won’t be significantly impacted–a net positive for price. The trader expects liquidity to ramp up in the coming months, boosting prices. Bitcoin is down after an impressive September that saw prices climb higher, reaching $66,000. Historically, September is bearish for Bitcoin. However, by the end of September, it was up 7%, rejecting early losses and closing above a strong liquidation level at around $65,000 and $66,000. Optimism is high because Bitcoin is printing at the same price as in early August and September. Bitcoin prices had plunged to as low as $49,000 by the first week of August before recovering steadily in the next three weeks. In early September, prices again fell, dropping to as low as $52,000 before resuming the uptrend set in motion in August. It remains to be seen whether the events of early August and September will be replicated. However, optimism is high, and most BTC holders, according to CoinMarketCap sentiment analysis, are bullish. Over 60% of all voters expect BTC to edge higher, while 38% are bearish, expecting sellers to dominate. Possible tailwinds for bulls include the inflow of capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Soso Value data shows that when BTC prices fell on October 1, BlackRock bought over $40 million worth of coins. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Global management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Bain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Citi recently reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $245 price target. Analysts at the advisory issued an investor note following a third party seller event named Amazon Accelerate. The note detailed that the advisory was incrementally confident that Amazon's core retail segment would continue to gain greater wallet share as fulfillment efficiencies lowered overall cost to serve. With faster shipping speeds, the rise in essentials, and improving conversion rates, Amazon's core retail business would deliver continued share gains and expanding margins as Web Services demand accelerated, the note underlined. Overall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Citi recently reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $245 price target. Analysts at the advisory issued an investor note following a third party seller event named Amazon Accelerate. The note detailed that the advisory was incrementally confident that Amazon's core retail segment would continue to gain greater wallet share as fulfillment efficiencies lowered overall cost to serve. With faster shipping speeds, the rise in essentials, and improving conversion rates, Amazon's core retail business would deliver continued share gains and expanding margins as Web Services demand accelerated, the note underlined. Overall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Global management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Bain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.

A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120 Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes and sells memory and storage products. The company recently announced the availability of a new solid-state drive that offers two times faster performance than the previous model. The new drive would give gamers, students and creatives a boost in speed when they boot and use data-intensive applications, per the company. The new solid-state drive has capacities up to 2 terabytes and read and write speeds of 7,100 and 6,000 megabytes per second respectively. The new offering expands the portfolio of Micron Technology to address PCs, laptops and PlayStation 5. Baird recently lowered the price target on Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock to $150 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The advisory said Micron expected its HBM share to hit parity with its overall DRAM market share in C2025, which was the crux of Baird's investment thesis on the stock given their views HBM could generate low-60%s gross margin while representing a 60% CAGR. Baird said the chipmaker remained one of their top ideas and valuation was attractive and the HBM opportunity was not fully priced in. Overall MU ranks 11th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Consensus revenue estimates suggest continued growth for this metric, with revenue projected to increase from around $27 billion in fiscal 2024 to over $37 billion in fiscal 2028. There is plenty of potential for further acceleration due to the AI revolution. Gary Dickerson, the chief of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, noting that the whole industry was focused on energy efficient computing as the biggest global inflections ever were driving the semiconductor growth, like AI, IoT, Industrial Automation, Robotics, EVs, Autonomous Vehicles, and Renewable Energy. Per Dickerson, these were all just really big multi-trillion dollar inflections. Overall AMAT ranks 14th on our list of the trending AI stocks.

On the other hand, the advisory highlighted that an equity-like investment from Apollo could be a very possible outcome, which would be a positive sign of confidence. However, the extent of existing shareholder dilution would be a key consideration, Wells added. Investment advisory Bernstein has a Market Perform rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and recently lowered the price target to $25 from $35. In an investor note, the advisory noted that the Q2 results of the firm were challenged and Q3 outlook was awful as the company saw the second half of 2024 recovery more muted than prior expectations amid weaker macro and some client inventory channel adjustments.

OSLO, Norway--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Crayon, a global leader in digital transformation, today announced it has hit four key growth milestones during its 10-year anniversary for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. Despite the challenges posed by market dynamics, the company has prevailed, attributing its success to a strategic partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS). Last year, the COVID-19 tech bubble finally burst causing chaos in the global IT market with 262,000 employeesi being laid off. According to Gartner (NYSE:IT) ®ii, The overall IT spending growth rate for 2023 was 3.3%, only a 0.3% increase from 2022. This was largely due to change fatigue among CIOs. Momentum will regain in 2024, with overall IT spending increasing 6.8%. In May 2023, amidst global market fluctuations, Crayon strengthened its position by entering a four-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement with AWSiii. The agreement expanded Crayon's existing AWS Premier Tier Services Partner role and sought to create a Crayon team of 500 AWS-certified experts worldwide.

Title: Kong Report Unveils AI Landscape CXOs Must Navigate For Innovation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2024/10/03/kong-report-unveils-ai-landscape-cxos-must-navigate-for-innovation/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T05:43:04Z
Full Content:
API Artificial intelligence has moved beyond the hype cycle to become a transformative force in the enterprise. According to Kong's API Impact Report 2024, 92% of developers and business leaders say AI is a priority for their organizations. This widespread adoption is set to unleash a wave of innovation and economic growth, with APIs playing a crucial role in enabling AI technologies. The report, which surveyed 747 IT professionals and business leaders, reveals that the symbiotic relationship between AI and APIs is poised to create a staggering $43 trillion in cumulative economic impact by 2030. This projection underscores the critical importance of APIs in the AI ecosystem and highlights why CXOs need to prioritize their API strategy alongside AI initiatives. Here are 10 key insights from the report that every executive should consider: The promise of AI is not just hype - it's already translating into real-world results. A whopping 83% of respondents report that their organization's AI investments have created opportunities for new products or services in the last year. This rapid return on investment is likely driving the prioritization of AI, with 92% of those surveyed saying AI is a priority relative to other initiatives. For CXOs, this data point serves as a clear mandate to accelerate AI adoption. Organizations that lag behind in leveraging AI risk falling behind competitors who are already reaping the benefits of increased innovation and new revenue streams. ChatGPT remains the most widely used large language model in the workplace, with 27% of respondents reporting its use. However, the AI landscape is highly competitive and fragmented. Microsoft's Azure AI (18%) and Google Gemini (17%) follow closely, while a diverse range of other players like Meta's Llama, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic's Claude and others each capture significant market share. This diversity suggests organizations are exploring multiple AI solutions rather than relying on a single provider. LLM Adoption The above chart highlights a trend towards organizations adopting a multi-LLM strategy. As different models prove better suited for specific tasks, companies are increasingly leveraging various LLMs for different use cases. This approach allows organizations to benefit from the strengths of multiple AI models and services, potentially leading to more robust and versatile AI implementations across their operations. The competitive and rapidly evolving nature of the AI field is driving this strategic diversification in enterprise AI adoption. The report highlights that there's no AI without APIs. APIs serve as the eyes, ears and hands of AI systems, enabling communication between humans, AI systems and other digital tools. This interdependence is reflected in Gartner's prediction that by 2026, over 30% of the increase in demand for APIs will come from AI and tools using large language models. As AI usage proliferates, so will the number of APIs that enable them. CXOs should recognize that their API strategy is inseparable from their AI strategy. Investing in robust API management will be crucial for organizations looking to harness the full potential of AI technologies. With the exponential growth in API usage comes a corresponding increase in security risks. The report forecasts a 548% growth in the number of annual API attacks by 2030, reaching nearly 42,000 attacks in the U.S. alone. This alarming projection highlights the need for CXOs to prioritize API security as part of their overall cybersecurity strategy. As organizations rush to adopt AI, they must ensure that their API infrastructure is robust enough to withstand increasingly sophisticated attacks. Data privacy, security and regulatory compliance are the top reasons organizations implement AI restrictions, according to 60% of respondents. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable, as 60% of users admit to finding ways around their organization's AI usage restrictions. This disconnect between policy and practice presents a significant challenge for CXOs. It's crucial to develop AI governance frameworks that balance security and compliance requirements with the need for innovation and productivity. When it comes to integrating AI services with existing microservice infrastructures, data privacy and security/governance top the list of challenges for nearly 60% of those surveyed. This highlights the complexity of implementing AI at scale within enterprise environments. CXOs should be prepared to invest in tools and platforms that can help bridge the gap between AI services and existing infrastructure while maintaining robust security and governance controls. The impact of AI on the workforce is a mixed picture. While 57% of respondents say AI will make their job easier and 60% are passionate about working with AI, there are also concerns. About 35% feel AI adoption is moving too fast and 18% believe AI adoption will lead to layoffs in their organization. CXOs need to navigate these conflicting sentiments carefully. Implementing AI successfully will require not just technological investments, but also a focus on change management and upskilling initiatives to ensure employees are prepared for an AI-augmented workplace. Despite concerns about job displacement, the report suggests that AI is also creating new opportunities. Half of those surveyed say AI will enhance productivity and innovation, while 26% believe AI will create new positions or opportunities in their organizations. This finding aligns with historical patterns of technological disruption, where new technologies often create more jobs than they displace. CXOs should be prepared to identify and develop new roles that leverage AI capabilities to drive business value. Looking ahead, 3 out of 4 respondents believe AI will increase innovation and create new opportunities. This optimistic outlook suggests that AI is set to become a fundamental part of how work gets done across industries. As AI continues to reshape the business landscape, the symbiotic relationship between AI and APIs will play a crucial role in driving innovation and economic growth. CXOs who recognize this interdependence and invest accordingly will be well-positioned to lead their organizations into the AI-powered future. For CXOs, the message is clear: adopting AI is about positioning your organization for long-term success in a rapidly changing digital landscape. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Cognitive bias can prevent us from knowing when to quit
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/10/03/cognitive-bias-can-prevent-us-from-knowing-when-to-quit/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
US president Joe Biden’s reluctance to step aside from the US presidential race on the basis of his belief that he was the only candidate who could defeat Donald Trump is a classic case of someone trapped by a cognitive bias. It’s a common problem. Consider Muhammad Ali’s decision to stay in the ring well best his prime and the disastrous consequences it had for his mental and physical health, or Tiger Woods, who now puts in underwhelming performances in golf tournaments after enduring career-threatening injuries. Not knowing when to quit is just one example of the traps or cognitive biases that trip people up, especially those in positions in power. It’s an interesting subject ranged over by Irish-born author and former senior executive in global investment banking Nuala Walsh in her well-crafted book Tune In: How to Make Smarter Decisions in a Noisy World. According to Walsh, the most underestimated risk facing modern society is not economic, political, technological or even climate-related. Instead, it’s human-decision risk, triggered by our tendency to tune out what really matters. [ Bridging the gap between academic learning and workplace skillsOpens in new window ] A substantial body of research attributes disasters to human error, she notes. It accounts for 94 per cent of road accidents, 88 per cent of cyberattacks and 80 per cent of aviation accidents, while medical misdiagnosis is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Human error, she adds underpins cult followings, scams, scandals, miscarriages of justice and more. Walsh packs a lot of scientific research into her book and has identified at least 75 biases. To make her core ideas more digestible, she uses the mnemonic PERIMETERS to describe 10. Power involves your elevation of idols, authorities and experts; Ego is about your commitment to your ideas above others; Risk concerns your appetite for thrills and intolerance of doubt; Identity is your craving to curate image and impress while Memory is your ability to accurately recall data. Then there’s Ethics, your ability to resist temptation and wrongdoing; Time, your tendency to live in the past, present or future; Emotion, your aptitude to regulate impulses and excess; Relationship, your predisposition to follow the crowd and finally Story, your readiness to accepted stated narratives as fact. “When you label something, it makes it easier to interpret and analyse. If people can understand their sources of misjudgment themselves, they could avoid a lot of predictable error. “Once you understand human behaviour you have an unrivalled insight into people, why they make decisions and why they get it right and why they get it wrong. You are also able to explain yesterday’s worst mistakes in order to prevent tomorrow’s,” she tells The Irish Times. While all of us are subject to bias, the decisions made by those in positions of power have much more far-reaching consequences. “Who pays the price of your success or failure, you or other people? The more power you have, the more other people pay the price for your misjudgment.” Walsh completed a masters in business at UCD, following a degree in Trinity and, after an assignment with the World Bank, embarked on a 30-year career in financial services. Recognised among the 100 Most Influential Women in Finance, her 30-year global investments career spanned BlackRock, Merrill Lynch and Standard Life Aberdeen, where she served as chief marketing officer. She stepped off the corporate ladder a few years ago for a portfolio career as a behavioural scientist, lecturer, business consultant, non-executive board member and speaker, undertaking a fresh masters along the way. Among her interesting roles, she serves on the board of the British and Irish Lions and is on the inclusion advisory board of the English Football Association. [ Skill, experience and expectations - navigating workplace realitiesOpens in new window ] Her corporate career gave her some strong personal insights that have informed her work. The rules of the game change when you reach the C-suite, was a valuable piece of advice a chief executive officer gave her along the way, something that was borne out through her own experience. “You see the machinations, the Machiavellism and the narcissism. People have more to lose and nobody wants to give it up. They will go to extreme levels to hang on to power. And don’t expect fairness when you are reaching for a title or a promotion. We are hopeful creatures and no employee wants to think they are a number, and that the company doesn’t have their best interest at heart, but there’s a lot of wishful thinking in that.” She has seen many of the biases she describes in the book played when it comes to mergers and acquisitions in the corporate world. These include deal fever, belief bias, confirmation bias and groupthink, as well as chief executives under pressure to get a result and inadequate due diligence. “People tune out common sense in mergers. They tune in to ego, familiarity, convenience and tune out the voice of dissenters. Anyone who is different is explained away. Who’s going to go against that over-excited CEO? He’s just sold the deal to the board. Failure is often attributable to the human factor rather than the earnings factor. Companies don’t plan for human risk, they plan for financial risk. They don’t judge human compatibility to be as important as market or product complementarity. Under pressure, people often make wrong judgment calls.” [ Getting a handle on workplace cultureOpens in new window ] While much has been written about the macho culture that may have driven poor decisions, especially in the 2008 financial crisis, the need to exert power is not gender-specific, she says. “We are all subject to misjudgment and there are as many women as men who are power-hungry and desperate to get to the top for many reasons.” Decoding bias, Walsh says, isn’t a question of intelligence and personality but it does require becoming intentional. In our hyper-fast, distraction-filled world, we need to slow down, organise our attention, consider alternative arguments and take time out to reflect on important decisions. Important questions that should be asked are: what biases might hinder interpretation?; what did I hear that sounded odd or wrong?; what aspects should I probe further; and what did I not hear that I should have?

Title: Najib Just A Crook – Lawyer Admits His Client Stole Money But Tried To Hoodwink The Judge That Najib’s Robin Hood

Time Published: 2024-10-03T04:05:00Z
Full Content:
How do you hoodwink a judge that you were not corrupt even though you had stolen money, never mind whether the amount was RM2.27 billion or just 1% of it, which translates to RM22,000,000? Former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s hotshot attorney might have found the answer – convince the court that his client was actually the Robin Hood, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. But there is one huge problem. He isn’t the legendary heroic outlaw called Robin Hood, but the despicable corrupt prime minister called Najib Razak. Neither is Najib a highly skilled archer and swordsman, even though he is indeed a highly skilled crook and liar. And he stole from the poor taxpayers and gave to his gang of rich politicians so that the ill-gotten money could be used to buy votes. Hilariously, during Najib’s trial over the misappropriation of RM2.27 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad’s (1MDB) funds, lead defence lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah argued that because 99% of the stolen money was not for Najib’s personal use, his client cannot be considered a corrupt man. He claimed the money was spent for the benefit of the public. Even if Najib had spent 99% of the RM2.27 billion for corporate social responsibility, social welfare and political purposes as claimed, which he didn’t and could not fully prove he did, the personal spending of 1% of RM2.27 billion (or RM22 million as admitted by Shafee) is still a mega corruption by any standard. In comparison, a couple was sentenced to 28 days in prison and fined RM3,000 for stealing 19 packets of Milo. Going by Najib’s hotshot lawyer’s logic, if his client can walk free for spending like Robin Hood, the married couple (Mohamad Nor Azam Bakar and Noor Azura Rosslan) too should not go to jail for spending like a prophet – stealing to obtain money to cover dialysis treatment costs for Nor Azam’s mother, as well as for their 5 children, two of whom are disabled. If the poor married couple had to spend 28 days in prison for stealing eight packets of 2kg Milo worth RM358.96 from a supermarket, then Najib must be fairly sentenced to a jail term equivalent to 61,288 times heavier. That would be 1,716,064 days (or 4,700 years) in prison. Exactly why Najib can be allowed to steal RM22 million, but the Malay couple must be jailed for stealing Milo worth RM358.96? “If I were a robber, I would have used the money for personal purposes,” – Shafee told the criminal court during the RM2.27 billion 1MDB scandal, where his client is facing 25 counts of abuse of power and money laundering charges. Again, using his silly logic, does that mean a bank account can be used for drug trafficking as long as 1% of the dirty money used for personal purposes? Just because Najib did not use up 100% of the money, which his genius attorney already admitted was stolen from 1MDB, it does not mean the spending behaviour is against the pathology of corruption. Likewise, just because Najib could not perform “spoon” on Rosmah Mansor, and could only do the traditional missionary position, it does not mean the couple did not engage in sex. Shafee also argued that Najib’s return of US$620 million of the US$681 million deposited into his bank accounts showed that he did not have any bad faith. Like a broken record, Najib’s highly paid lawyers have argued that the ex-premier believed the money he had received in his bank accounts were donations from Saudi Arabia’s royalty. Shafee even had the cheek to show four fabricated letters from a dubious Saudi prince. Najib Razak, the disgraced former Malaysian prime minister sent to 12 years in prison for corruption, is a known serial liar. There are tonnes of lies he had spewed over the years. When he was still in power, he lied that he did not know his partner-in-crime Jho Low, not to mention repetitively said he did not steal any money – even after US$681 million (RM2.6 billion) was found in his bank accounts. When he was first linked to the 1MDB scandal, he kept denying that he knew Jho Low or had siphoned money from the US$6.5 billion in bonds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise between 2009 and 2014. When that failed, he diverted the attention to Saudi, knowing very well the gullible Malay Muslims will believe anything he said whenever the “Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques” card is flashed. There were basically three phases of “lies” that Najib had mastered over the years in his political career. First – “deny” all the allegations. Second, when you cannot deny anymore, “divert” the attention elsewhere. Third, “blame” everyone except himself and his families. Repeat the process again until people get confused and sick and tired of his lies. He has many favourite lies in his pockets. One of them was that the money which he had stolen was donations from Arab royal family. Another favourite lie was that he had returned US$620 million to the senders. But all those lies have been debunked, one after another, as the trials progress, including the trial involving RM42 million stolen from SRC International Sdn Bhd(a subsidiary of 1MDB), which he had lost and sent to prison. The real explosive 1MDB scandal saw its first trial involving ex-Goldman banker Roger Ng Chong Hwa in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, in 2022. The trial of Mr Ng, a Malaysian, had opened a can of worms which was absolutely damaging to the former Malaysian premier at a critical time when he embarks on a journey to make a comeback as prime minister again. For example, the despicable man can no longer claim that the US$681 million was donations from Saudi royal family. In the trial against Ng, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) testified in the court that not only Jho Low had stolen US$1.42 billion (RM6 billion), Najib Razak similarly stole US$756 million (RM3.2 billion) while his stepson, Riza Aziz, pocketed US$238 million (RM1 billion). Not only the testimony from FBI forensic accountant Eric Van Dorn was the first time the U.S. authorities have detailed how those involved in the 1MDB deals were paid and how much they received, it has confirmed for the third time – after previous confirmation from the U.S. DOJ and U.S. Securities Commission – that there was no Saudi donations whatsoever, as claimed by Najib. In 2022, for the first time since Najib hoodwinked 4-million gullible Malays in the 2018 General Election, the American jury finally got a look at “hard proof” of the treasure bought with the so-called US$620 million that Najib claimed to have had returned. Part of the stolen money was used to buy a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth a staggering US$23 million (RM97 million) for Najib’s wife – Rosmah Mansor. But how could that happen when Najib had returned the donation money? Here’s where Najib should be given a Grammy Award for his lies. It was only half-truth when he said US$620 million had been returned. What he didn’t tell his stupid supporters was that he did not return the money to the Saudi royal family (because there was none to begin with), but had transferred it to Tanore Finance Corp. account in Singapore. Tanore Finance had been just a staging account set up by Jho Low and Najib Razak to be diverted again to fund their lavish lifestyle. The account had nothing to do with Saudi government or the kingdom’s royal family. In fact, a month after the US$620 million was returned to the Tanore, the money was used to purchase a 22-K pink diamond necklace for Rosmah (refer to chart). According to U.S.-DOJ investigations as early as 2017, Jho Low had arranged for jewellery designer Lorraine Schwartz (also known as “Jewish Queen of Oscar Bling”) for the pink diamond – with a heart-shaped gem – on June 2, 2013. In August the same year, Najib conveniently returned US$620 million to Tanore Finance, after receiving US$681 million from the same account in March 2013. Apparently, Rosmah wanted an 18-carat diamond, but Schwartz said she only had a 22-carat pink diamond. Schwartz subsequently travelled to Monaco on July 5, 2013 and met Jho Low aboard the Topaz, one of the largest private yachts in the world built at a cost of €400 million. Jho Low had chartered the 147-meter yacht for 7 days at a cost of €3.5 million. Aboard the Topaz, Schwartz showed the pink diamond to a group of people – Jho Low, Rosmah, and one of her friends. The group happily discussed the design of the necklace to hold the 22-carat pink diamond. On Sept 28, 2013, Schwartz met again with Jho Low and Rosmah in a hotel suite in the Mandarin Time Warner in New York in order to show them the layout of the necklace design. The 22-carat pink diamond, described as “22.17-carat Natural Fancy Intense Pink VS2 clarity (GIA#2115637296) Cut-Cornered Square Modified Brilliant Cut diamond,” was invoiced on 3 July, 2013 for a jaw-dropping US$23,000,000. The second invoice, dated July 31, 2013, was for US$4,300,000 for the accompanying necklace. Hence, the total cost was US$27,300,000. Schwartz was asked to invoice Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited (“Blackrock”). On Sept 9, 2013, just days after Najib proudly told all and sundry that he had returned US$620 million to its original donor (Tanore Finance), US$58,849,050 was wired from the same Tanore Account to another account at Falcon Bank in Singapore held in the name of Midhurst Trading Limited (“Midhurst Trading Account”). The following day (Sept 10, 2013), Midhurst transferred US$32,760,000 to an account at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore held by Blackrock (referred to as “Blackrock Account” by DOJ). On the same day, Blackrock made two separate wire transfers to a bank account at Bank of America in New York held by Lorraine Schwartz Inc. in payment for the 22-carat pink diamond necklace. Investigations done by US-DOJ also revealed that “Blackrock Account” was used to do nothing but to pay for jewellery purchases for Jho Low and their associates, including Auntie Rosie. In fact, between April 2013 and September 2014, the account was used to purchase a total of approximately US$200 million (RM840 million) in jewellery, again, using funds traceable to the 2013 bonds and the 2014 Deutsche Bank loans. Besides the 22-carat pink diamond necklace, Rosmah had also purchased 27 other jewelleries from the same “Jewish Queen of Oscar Bling”. The 27 pieces of jewelleries, all 18K – white gold, yellow gold, rose gold, black gold – of bangles or necklaces, were priced from US$40,172 to US$240,000 a pop and were purchased during dinner between Rosmah and Schwartz at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Known as a “PONZI” scheme, the details of how the pink diamond necklace was purchased with money stolen from 1MDB had already been exposed in 2017, when the U.S. Justice Department released its investigation papers – documents as thick as 251-page – that linked then-PM Najib Razak as the “MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1” and Rosmah as the “wife of MALAYSIAN OFFICIAL 1”. Najib didn’t return the US$620 million to his self-proclaimed Saudi royal family because the money was unused (as he famously claims). He returned it because he needed to siphon it elsewhere, as instructed by Jho Low whenever Rosmah wanted to buy more “bling-bling”. The money was siphoned from the three bond sales for 1MDB (code-named Project Magnolia, Maximus and Catalyze). Under “Project Maximus”, the second bonds issued by 1MDB in 2012, known as Aabar BVI phase, Najib received US$30 million. But the juiciest kickbacks came from the “Project Catalyze” (Tanore phase) in 2013 when the disgraced Malaysian leader received a further US$681 million misappropriated from 1MDB. Now, the jigsaw puzzle is almost solved. The U.S. authorities (DOJ, SEC and FBI) have been very consistent in their investigation since then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced that the Justice Department filed lawsuits to seize assets on July 20, 2016. But the same cannot be said about Najib and Rosmah, who have displayed inconsistency and contradiction in their half-baked fairy tales. From insisting that the RM2.7 billion in his bank accounts was a donation from the Saudi royal family, to saying he was “assuming” the money was donations, and to blaming Jho Low for scamming him, Najib is as guilty as hell. Rosmah even cried that it was a UAE price (Sheikh Mansour Zayed) who had wanted to give a pink diamond necklace to her. Do they dare to sue the Government of the United States? Every government on the planet Earth knows that Najib is guilty. Roger Ng had already been convicted and given 10 years in prison. In August 2024, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court convicted Patrick Mahony and Swiss-Saudi Tarek Obaid for embezzling more than US$1.8 billion. For Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah to free Najib will be a huge embarrassment to not only the Anwar government, but also the Malaysian Judiciary.

Title: Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset discontinued

News Microsoft will be discontinuing its HoloLens 2 headset once stock runs out, according to UploadVR. The mixed reality headset HoloLens 2 debuted in 2019, three years after its predecessor, the HoloLens, launched. Due to its hefty price tag, the product is mostly marketed towards businesses and enterprises. Production is grinding to a halt, and security updates will continue until December 31, 2027. Software updates will stop after that. Microsoft apparently does not intend to produce a third iteration of the HoloLens, as it’s believed that the company has canceled the project due to ‘lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges’. The mixed reality team has slowly dwindled as well this year and the last. The HoloLens IVA will continue as a system and an AR headset for the US army. Microsoft recently brought its Office apps and Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest headsets and will be working with the company for Windows 11 integration. iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc.

Title: Tokenized funds get preliminary approval to be used as collateral in the US

Funds such as BUIDL and FOBXX could be approved as collateral in 2024 in the US traditional finance market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee voted to approve guidelines for using tokenized shares of money-market funds as collateral for traditional financial operations. As reported by Bloomberg on Oct. 2 citing an anonymous source, the recommendations aim to integrate blockchain technology in managing non-cash collateral consistent with margin requirements set by US regulators and derivatives clearing organizations. If approved by the full committee later this year, the recommendations could significantly increase the adoption of tokenized collateral on financial markets. Moreover, it would improve the capital efficiency of companies looking to use tokenized collateral. This movement benefits BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX. BUIDL currently leads the tokenized US treasuries market, with over $518 million in market size, as per rwa.xyz data. Meanwhile, FOBXX holds $435 million in market share. Notably, BUIDL and FOBXX are the two largest tokenized money-market funds, holding nearly half of the $2.3 billion tokenized US treasuries sector. Additionally, besides BlackRock, the subcommittee includes members such as Citadel, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg LP. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications are already looking for the benefits created by merging traditional finance products and blockchain features. Leading money market Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) on Aug. 26, which would use BUIDL shares to keep its stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The proposal consisted of using USD Coin (USDC) provided by users as collateral to get GHO to buy BUIDL shares and lock them in a smart contract. The benefits, according to the proposal content, are two-fold: GHO’s backing gets diversified with real-world assets, while BUIDL yields create value accrual for stablecoin holders. Moreover, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs announced a new stablecoin completely backed by BUIDL, the UStb. Using a real-world money-market fund deployed on-chain, Ethena wants to provide a more stable alternative to its funding rate-backed stablecoin USDe.

Title: Axon CEO sells over $66 million in company stock
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/axon-ceo-sells-over-66-million-in-company-stock-93CH-3646298
Time Published: 2024-10-03T00:29:03Z
Full Content:
Patrick W. Smith, the Chief Executive Officer of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), has sold a significant portion of his company stock, according to recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Over a series of transactions, Smith sold shares totaling over $66 million, with prices ranging from $400.0243 to $405.2216 per share. The sales were conducted through a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows insiders of publicly-traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. This plan enables them to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of insider trading. On September 30, 2024, Smith executed sales of Axon stock that amounted to approximately $31,946,132, with individual share prices ranging between $400.0243 and $402.5968. The following day, he continued to sell shares worth around $34,395,299, with the price per share ranging from $402.5968 to $405.2216. These transactions reflect the weighted average sales price within the given ranges. In addition to the sales, Smith also acquired shares through option exercises, which are reported separately and are not included in the total sale value. The total value for these transactions was $68,183,169, with prices per share ranging from $399.22 to $404.51. Axon Enterprise, Inc., formerly known as Taser International, is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company specializing in law enforcement technology, including electrical weapons and body cameras. The latest transactions by the CEO have been made public through the mandatory reporting of insider transactions to the SEC. Investors often monitor insider buying and selling as it can provide insights into a company's financial health and executive confidence. However, it is essential to note that insider transactions can be subject to various motivations and do not necessarily signal a company's future performance. For further details on the CEO's transactions, interested parties can access the full SEC filings. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise has been making significant strides in its business, as highlighted by its record-breaking second quarter. Revenue for the period exceeded $500 million, with new business bookings surpassing $1 billion. This robust growth was driven primarily by new products, TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, and a shift in revenue mix, with software and services now accounting for 39% of total revenue. Baird, a financial services firm, has maintained its Outperform rating on Axon while raising the stock's price target from $360 to $400. This decision reflects the firm's confidence in Axon's continued expansion and innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence capabilities and drone technology. Axon's future contracted revenue stands at approximately $7.4 billion, and full-year revenue guidance has been raised to between $2 billion and $2.05 billion. The company's adjusted EBITDA reached $123 million, with a margin of 24.5% for the quarter. Despite these positive developments, Axon executives have expressed cautiousness regarding potential economic downturns. However, they also highlighted the fastest growth in their Cloud and Services segment at 47% year-over-year, and an increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to $850 million, a 44% increase year-over-year. These are among the recent developments in Axon's business. To provide additional context to Patrick W. Smith's recent stock sales, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON). Axon's market capitalization stands at an impressive $30.56 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the law enforcement technology sector. The company's revenue growth has been robust, with a 32.59% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, reaching $1.81 billion. This strong performance aligns with an InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year. The company's gross profit margin is particularly noteworthy at 59.81%, which InvestingPro highlights as an "impressive gross profit margin." This metric suggests Axon's ability to maintain pricing power and control costs effectively, which is crucial in the technology sector. Interestingly, while Axon's P/E ratio stands at 104.46, an InvestingPro Tip notes that the company is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." This could indicate potential undervaluation considering the company's growth prospects. Additionally, Axon holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which provides financial flexibility and may contribute to investor confidence. The stock's performance has been remarkable, with a one-year price total return of 110.62% as of the latest data. This aligns with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting Axon's "high return over the last year." The stock is currently trading near its 52-week high, with the price at 99.63% of its peak. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 22 additional tips for Axon Enterprise, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Microsoft to Invest $4.8 Billion in Italy for AI Infrastructure

Microsoft announced Wednesday (Oct. 2) plans for a €4.3 billion ($4.8 billion) investment in Italy, its biggest investment in the country so far. The initiative is set to roll out over the next two years, allowing the Big Tech company to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure while providing digital skills training to more than 1 million Italians by the end of next year, Microsoft said in a news release. “Microsoft’s data center expansion in Northern Italy coupled with its commitment to provide extensive AI skills training supports the rising demand for AI compute and cloud services across Italy as organizations look to boost productivity and uncover new breakthroughs with AI,” the company said. “This landmark investment underscores our long-standing commitment to Italy’s digital transformation,” said Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. “By expanding access to our AI technology and expertise, we are equipping the Italian government, businesses, and the broader workforce with the tools to build an AI-driven economy that creates jobs and drives prosperity.” The multibillion-dollar infusion will make Italy North one of Microsoft’s largest data center regions on the continent and will play a critical part in meeting European data boundary requirements, the release said. The new data center will also serve as a data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa. Microsoft also said it plans to roll out new training programs for more than 1 million people in Italy by 2025, focused on AI fluency, technical AI skills, AI business transformation and the promotion of safe and responsible AI development. This comes shortly after news that a new coalition of tech and finance giants are working together to build a network of data centers that can meet growing global demand for AI. As PYMNTS reported on Sept. 18, the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership is putting $100 billion into building new infrastructure, with the aim of reducing strain on existing data centers and power sources. The new coalition is being spearheaded by Microsoft, BlackRock and other companies. “We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every sector of the economy,” Satya Nadella, the chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said in a news release at the time. “The Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership will help us deliver on this vision, as we bring together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way.” The initiative plans to raise up to $30 billion in private equity financing and invest up to $100 billion. While the investments will be primarily focused within the U.S., the partnership said it may also pursue opportunities in other countries. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

SEC slaps GQG: The US Securities and Exchange Commission levied a $500,000 fine against GQG Partners and Rajiv Jain for violations of whistleblower protection laws and issued a cease-and-desist order against the illegal practices. At base, GQG required (some?) new hires and one former employee to sign agreements which would make it difficult for them to disclose wrongdoing on GQG’s part. “Whether through agreements or otherwise, firms cannot impose barriers to persons providing evidence about possible securities law violations to the SEC, as GQG did,” said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit. As of 27 September 2024, GQG’s website did not reflect any discussion of the action. Reports in other media note that GQG “acknowledged the SEC’s jurisdiction in the case …without admitting or denying the findings.” The settlement stops the matter from going to more formal proceedings, the outcome of which might have been more visible and more embarrassing. For a $150 billion firm, the fine is trivial except for the public relations bruise it represents. SEC pats Oaktree: Oaktree Capital, similarly, was found to have violated securities law by failing to report that they owned more than 5% of the stock of several portfolio companies. There is a purely mechanical rule (13d, if you care) that says if you own more than 5% of the shares outstanding of any company, you need to report that fact because your stake is large enough to cause conflicts. Oaktree did not. Because of strong remedial action and cooperation of the Commission’s staff, the sanctions on Oaktree came to a $375,000 fine and a promise never to do it again. abrdn Focused U.S. Small Cap Equity and abrdn Emerging Markets Dividend Funds are being converted into ETFs. The investment adviser for the Funds believes shareholders in the funds could benefit from lower overall net expenses, additional trading flexibility, increased portfolio holdings transparency, and enhanced tax efficiency. Each new ETF will be managed in a substantially similar manner as the corresponding mutual fund, with identical investment objectives, investment strategies, and fundamental investment policies. If approved by the Board, it is anticipated that the conversions will occur in the first quarter of 2025. First Eagle Global Equity ETF and First Eagle Overseas Equity ETF are in registration. Both ETFs will be actively managed by Matthew McLennan and Kimball Brooker, Jr., who will be the co-heads of both ETFs and assisted by members of the First Eagle Global Value Team. Vanguard today announced that it will reduce the minimum asset requirement from $3,000 to $1001 for its robo-advisor service, Digital Advisor, significantly increasing accessibility for investors interested in utilizing a digital advice service to manage short- and long-term financial goals. Vanguard Digital Advisor launched in 2020 and provides an all-digital financial planning and investment advisory service that delivers highly personalized, convenient, low-cost advice. The digital advice platform helps clients identify their retirement and non-retirement goals, and then crafts and manages customized, diversified, and tax-efficient investment portfolios to achieve them. Enrollments in Vanguard Digital Advisor require at least $100 in each Vanguard Brokerage Account. For each taxable account or traditional, Roth, rollover, or inherited IRA you wish to enroll, the entire balance must be in certain investment types (based on eligibility screening by Digital Advisor at the time of enrollment) and/or the brokerage account’s settlement fund. Green flight in the oddest corners of the market: the Wahed Dow Jones Islamic World ETF (UMMA) “will no longer consider applying environmental, social, and governance criteria when selecting the Fund’s investments.” Similarly, effective December 10, 2024, the American Century Sustainable Equity Fund and its corresponding ETF will both be renamed Large Cap Equity and will abandon concerns for … you know, the end of the world. Wasatch International Value Fund is in registration. The Fund invests primarily in the equity securities of foreign companies of any size though they expect a significant portion of the Fund’s assets to be invested in companies with market capitalizations of over $5 billion at the time of purchase. David Powers will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Effective October 7, 2024, FullerThaler Behavioral Small-Mid Core Equity Fund will begin sales of C Shares (TICKER: FTWCX) and R6 Shares (TICKER: FTSFX). I’ve never understood why on earth anyone would buy “C” shares (which typically carry an astronomical expense ratio) but “R6” means the fund will be available to some retirement investors, so that’s nice. On September 25, 2024, the Board of Trustees approved a change to the dividend payment frequency of the Osterweis Strategic Income Fund from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis. Generally, it focuses on high-grade, short-term high-yield securities. Its downside capture over the past decade is 10% while its upside capture is 70%, for an astonishing capture ratio of 700. It’s a good, conservative fund with experienced management. Shareholders of Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF and the Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF have been invited to a proxy vote which would allow each fund to lower its expense ratio. That seems nice. The adviser is very clear about the function of the funds: it is to highlight the trading behavior of members of Congress in order to catalyze reform, rather than maximizing shareholder returns. That said, since inception trades by Democratic members of Congress have vastly outperformed those by Republican members. And, in case you’re wondering, Republican members of Congress aren’t buying Trump. Or, at the very least, they’re not willing to buy Trump Media stock. The Republican fund once owned a big 36 shares of DJT but seems to have dumped them in spring, 2024. BlackRock High Yield Municipal Fund will be reorganized into the iShares High Yield Muni Active ETF. The reorganization is anticipated to close as of the close of trading on February 7, 2025. The Essential 40 Stock Fund will be converted into an exchange-traded fund, the Essential 40 Stock ETF on October 17, 2024. The portfolio is composed of “forty stocks believed to represent the companies that are believed to be essential to the American way of life.” The fund has landed at or below the 50th percentile for six of its past seven years. Effective November 26, 2024, the passive ETF known as MUSQ Global Music Industry ETF will become the passive ETF known as MUSQ Global Music Industry Index ETF. The fund has only $22 million in assets and has lost 4.5% since inception, so we hope that the impending tweaks to the underlying index does some good. And if that doesn’t work, perhaps they might adopt the strategy used by the (deceased) Artist Formerly Known as Prince. TCW MetWest Corporate Bond Fund is being reorganized into the TCW Corporate Bond ETF, Class M shares will be reorganized into Class I shares prior to the reorganization on or about November 4. The AMG TimesSquare Global Small Cap and AMG TimesSquare Emerging Markets Small Cap Funds will be liquidated on or about December 11, 2024. AXS Alternative Value Fund will be liquidated on or about September 27. BCM Focus Small/Micro-Cap Focus Fund will be liquidated on or about October 11, 2024. Hmmm … “micro-cap” and “focus” go together like “bran flakes” and “ketchup,” for what that’s worth. The portfolio holds 20 microcap growth stocks, of which eight have declined by 25-80% in the past years. The result is illustrated by Morningstar’s performance graph where the blue line is below 99% of its peers for the past … well, most periods. Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF will be liquidated effective as of the close of business on October 4, 2024. John Hancock Government Income Fund is being reorganized into the John Hancock Investment Grade Bond Fund. If shareholders approve the reorganization during the January 2025 meeting, then the reorganization will occur on or about February 14, 2025. Per CityWire (9/30/2024), Morgan Stanley Investment Management is closing down its listed real estate and infrastructure business, liquidating all the funds it offers that invest in this asset class. The move will impact funds offered in the US, as well as in Asia and Europe.” That affects over $700 million in assets. The case for exiting real estate is rather clearer to us than the case for existing infrastructure. Natixis Loomis Sayles Short Duration Income ETF will be liquidated on or about September 30. Nuveen Social Choice Low Carbon Equity Fund will be reorganized into the Nuveen Large Cap Responsible Equity Fund. The reorganization is not subject to approval by the shareholders of the Target fund or the Acquiring fund. It is anticipated that the reorganization will be consummated in late 2024. Rondure New World Fund will be liquidated on or about October 18. The trigger for the liquidation of the fund, and subsequent closure of the firm, understandably, was not spelled out in the SEC filing. We discuss it, and wish Ms Geritz godspeed, in this month’s Publisher’s Letter. SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF will be canceled on or about October 30. TCW Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund, TCW MetWest AlphaTrak 500 Fund (M class), and TCW Short Term Bond Fund (I class) will all be liquidated on or about October 31, TCW MetWest Corporate Bond Fund will merge with and into TCW Corporate Bond ETF on or about October 11, 2024. As of Halloween, the strategy for the USCF Aluminum Strategy Fund will be “to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and distribute proceeds to shareholders.” VanEck Dynamic High Income ETF will be liquidated, wound down, and terminated on or about Tuesday, October 15, 2024. The Western Asset Total Return ETF will be merged with Western Asset Bond ETF sometime in the first quarter of 2025. While Western’s CIO has “gone on leave” because of an SEC investigation about 17,000 suspicious trades, that scandal seems to have no bearing here. This is just a bad fund going away.

Title: Tesla Missed High Sales Expectations. Will Robotaxi Also Disappoint?

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slid Wednesday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s third-quarter deliveries came in slightly below estimates, underscoring the challenges of the EV market and the burden of high expectations. Tesla delivered 462,890 cars last quarter, a marked improvement over the two prior periods in which deliveries declined on a year-over-year basis. The figures were also just a few hundred vehicles shy of the consensus estimate among analysts, according to FactSet. Tesla will need to maintain its third-quarter sales growth rate (+6.3%) if it’s going to sell as many cars as it did last year. Failure to do so would mark the carmaker’s first full-year sales decline on record. Tesla faces stiff competition, especially in China, the world’s largest auto market, where local manufacturers enjoy the benefits of lower production costs. Chinese giant BYD (BYDDY) sold a record 417,603 passenger vehicles—both electric and hybrid—in September. Tesla has attempted to grow its market share by cutting prices in China repeatedly over the last two years and offering Chinese buyers financing and insurance incentives. Tesla's margins have shrunk in the process. They will be a key focus for investors when the company reports earnings on Oct. 23. Wedbush analysts, in a note on Wednesday, estimated that promotional activity contributed to relatively strong sales in China last quarter. A slowdown in the U.S. and Europe, however, likely offset that strength. Wedbush analysts are confident Tesla can hit the target envisioned by analysts. Overall, they said, the deliveries were “a step in the right direction,” even if they did fall short of Wall Street’s whisper numbers, which Wedbush estimated were between 465,000-470,000. Wall Street's high expectations have been a thorn in the side of the market’s favorite tech stocks in recent months. Nvidia (NVDA) shares tanked in late August after its quarterly results topped analysts’ official estimates but missed their off-the-record forecasts. Google-parent Alphabet's (GOOG; GOOGL) profit also exceeded expectations for last quarter, but the stock tumbled as investors homed in on Youtube advertising revenue, which was slightly below expectations. High expectations heading into major business announcements are invariably reflected in a company's share price. Nvidia stock was up 153% from the start of the year before its disappointing August earnings report, while Alphabet was within 5% of its all-time high. Tesla stock rose more than 20% in September as Wall Street looked ahead to this month’s "robotaxi" event and priced in the benefit of lower interest rates. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note advised being "tactically cautious" on the stock because of hype around next week's robotaxi event. After months of speculation about what Tesla could unveil—progress on full self-driving software, a lower-cost model, etc.—"the bar seems quite high and [we] could envision a 'sell the news' type of market reaction." Tesla shares ended down 3.5% at $249.02 Wednesday, putting them back to near where they started 2024. TradingView

Title: Leaked: Whole Foods CEO tells staff he wants to turn Amazon’s RTO mandate into more ‘carrot’ than ‘stick’
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/02/leaked-whole-foods-ceo-meeting-amazon-5-day-rto-office-policy/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T21:43:24Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s five-day return-to-office order sent shock waves throughout the company and the broader business world last month. On Tuesday, Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel stepped up to the mic to assuage employee concerns at the Amazon-owned grocery chain. Saying he wanted Whole Foods employees to feel incentivized rather than bludgeoned into coming to the office every day, Buechel touted initiatives such as an “office experience task force” during a special meeting to address the RTO policy. “I want us to figure out, how do we find the win-win overall in supporting Whole Foods Market, our team members, our customers, and beyond,” Buechel said in the all-hands meeting on Tuesday, a recording of which was reviewed by Fortune. “Our goal here is not to make this seem like this is a stick,” he added. “We want to help create and work with our team members [in] having the carrot and getting the excitement about bringing back the culture and ultimately the interactions that we once had in our offices across the company.” Buechel said that his leadership team fielded 1,200 questions in advance of the meeting, which lasted a little less than an hour. Three employees attending the meeting in person were also given the mic to ask questions. The town hall comes two weeks after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that his company, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, would return to a full five days in office on Jan. 2, 2025, after nearly five years of remote and hybrid work at Amazon and its subsidiaries. Whole Foods spokesperson Rachel Malish only confirmed that Whole Foods staff will abide by the new Amazon mandate but did not respond to Fortune’s questions about the staff meeting. Jassy’s announcement came across as a tacit acknowledgement of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently chronicled. Jassy also noted that Amazon would look to thin out middle management and the bureaucracy that the CEO believes comes from too much of it, by reducing the ratio of middle managers to individual employees by 15%. One Whole Foods employee on Tuesday questioned leadership about how such a cut would be carried out at the organic grocery store chain. But Whole Foods HR exec Brian O’Connell told employees that that number is just a “target” and that the grocer has already “done a lot of good work” in reducing this ratio over the past year. “I don’t imagine we’re going to make a 15% reduction,” he said. Among the other queries employees had for management were questions about why Whole Foods workers should have to follow Amazon’s mandate when their compensation doesn’t always match that of their parent company counterparts, to whether the move was intended to force staff out, to how leadership plans to deal with a potential brain drain. Leadership offered vague answers to many questions—“freedom within a framework of a norm of an office-based culture” was one phrase from a Whole Foods marketing exec that especially rankled employees—and failed to explain how five days in office would fix problems that three days in person couldn’t. But Buechel was adamant that the mandate was not meant as an alternative to layoffs and that there would be flexibility to work from home when requiring quiet time to hit a deadline or if an unexpected personal need requires it. Buechel and other company executives pointed to efforts such as the creation of a new “office experience task force” made up of employees across company divisions who would be charged with brainstorming ideas to help staff transition from their current three-day hybrid structure to a new “office-based culture.” “What are things that we can do to make it exciting to come here and experience and work with our team members day in, day out?” the CEO asked rhetorically. The responsibility of figuring out how this balancing act will work will fall to individual managers, Buechel said. As for the company tracking how often employees badge into the office, which Jassy said would continue during the transition to full in-office work, the Whole Foods CEO said it would continue for now, but “my goal is to get rid of this” if employees “work responsibly.” “I don’t want us to be in this space,” he said. “I don’t want this to seem like we are punching a clock from 8 to 5. And I don’t want to be in a spot where we are tracking this.” Are you a current or former Whole Foods employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says Demand for Its Chips Is ‘Insane'

Demand for Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips is "insane," CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview Wednesday afternoon. Huang spoke during an interview on CNBC in connection with news of an expanded partnership with IT consulting firm Accenture (ACN) to help companies use artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the companies announced Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia, which closed 1.6% higher Wednesday, have more than doubled in value since the start of the year as companies have raced to buy the company's tech and build out AI infrastructure. Accenture shares moved 1.2% higher Wednesday and have gained about 1.5% in 2024 so far. As part of the deal, Accenture will form a new business group with consultants trained to help clients build custom AI solutions and capabilities with Nvidia’s tech, as well as Meta’s (META) Llama collection of open-source AI models. “This partnership allows us to span a large part of the world’s AI demand," Huang said, adding “this is the beginning of a new wave called enterprise AI.” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives likened Nvidia’s moves to build an ecosystem of partners to those of tech stalwarts Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL), suggesting it could help cement Nvidia’s position in the marketplace.

Title: OpenAI is now worth more than $150 billion

Time Published: 2024-10-02T17:40:00Z

OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar funding round is now complete, giving the artificial intelligence startup a valuation of $157 billion. The $6.6 billion raise is one of the largest private investments ever and puts OpenAI among the top three largest startups with venture backing, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are the other two. Thrive Capital, led by Joshua Kushner, reportedly led the funding round. Tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly backed the round, which included investors such as Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Abu Dhabi–based MGX. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new funding comes amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that OpenAI is spending more than it’s making. The startup’s monthly revenue reached $300 million in August — up 1,700% from the start of 2023, the New York Times reported. The New York Times (NYT) added that OpenAI expects to end the year with $3.7 billion in annual sales, according to financial documents its reporters reviewed. However, the startup also anticipates losing around $5 billion this year due to expenses such as running its AI models and paying employees, according to the review. Next year, OpenAI reportedly expects $11.6 billion in revenue. OpenAI is also reportedly considering restructuring its nonprofit status to attract investors, the Financial Times previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. As OpenAI considers a for-profit structure, CEO Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. In a meeting, both Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, told employees the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported.

Title: This is probably your last chance to get the 128GB Quest 3, but it's not the only VR headset discount I'd recommend right now

Don't wait around on this, because stock is already disappearing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We finally got confirmation last week that the Meta Quest 3S is real, and it's arriving this year. As a few rumors hinted though, it does mean that Meta is discontinuing some of its existing headsets to make room for a more affordable model. The Quest 2 and Quest Pro have been drifting in and out of stock for a while now, so while it's sad they'll now be officially retired, it's the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3 I'm more surprised about. The 128GB Quest 3 only launched this time last year and it's been one of the most accessible VR headsets worth buying ever since. VR games are relatively small, so for many people, paying more for a 512GB SKU hasn't been all that necessary. Since the announcement the 128GB version's death warrant was signed though, it feels like it's entered clearance mode. In the US, Best Buy is one of the last remaining suppliers with stock available, and it's reduced the device's price from $499.99 down to $429, giving you a sweet $70 saving. In the UK, Amazon has followed suit, dropping the cost to just £409.99 down from £479. It goes without saying, but I've not seen the Quest 3 hit this low a price tag since it launched last year, and I've been keeping a close eye on the headset's deals in that time. Amazon's US stock of the 128GB Quest 3 has already disappeared entirely, so if you're wanting a cheaper route into Meta's flagship device, I wouldn't wait around. I'd be surprised if this VR headset didn't transition into a collector's item by the time Prime Day Meta Quest deals officially start next week. Meta Quest 3 128GB | $499.99 $429.99 at Best Buy Save $70 - The 128GB Meta Quest 3 probably doesn't have much stock left, so this $70 saving is a great way to grab one before your only option is the more expensive 512GB SKU. As an added bonus, you'll also get a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow when it launches later this year. Buy it if: ✅ You want more storage space ✅ You want mixed reality features ✅ You're interested in playing SteamVR games Don't buy it if: ❌ You already play games on a PS5 UK: £409.99 at Amazon But why is the Quest 3 being discontinued, I hear you ask? Well, since the Quest 3S is targeting that more approachable market of first-time VR buyers or those who don't want to invest more than $350 on a standalone headset, the Quest 3 proper needs to stand out as an enthusiast device. Limiting choice to the 512GB model only distinguishes it from the competition, since other standalone headsets tend to offer less storage. While it's certainly sad that the Quest 3 128GB is no more, you can take solace in the fact that the 512GB SKU has now dropped in price slightly as well. In the UK and US, it's cheaper than it's ever been, dropping to $499 down from its original MSRP of $649, or £469 in the UK. That's an amazing reduction in its own right, although it's a massive slap in the face to anyone who bought that headset in the last few months at a higher price. Regardless of which Quest headset you buy, you'll get to benefit from the Batman Arkham Shadow pre-order bonus that's available for the Quest 3S. In all of Quest 3's life so far, this question has never been so hard to answer. If you want the best Quest headset in terms of its internal specs, but you don't want to spend money on a version with more storage, then absolutely jump on this 128GB model clearance sale. Truth be told, you'd struggle to fill up 512GB of space even if you use the headset daily for gaming and work. VR titles really are surprisingly small, so 128GB is more space than you'd think. That said, the competition has never been so fierce. Not only do you have the Meta Quest 3S to think about now, but if you're in the UK, you have the Pico 4 Ultra to consider, which is arguably better than the Quest 3 anyway. HTC Vive is also re-entering the consumer market with the Vive Focus Vision, which is a much higher-end device targeted at PC gamers. Then, you have what I'd argue is the Quest 3's biggest competition, PSVR 2. Almost like clockwork, Sony's headset has dropped in price as well. Its MSRP is $549, and Walmart is currently listing it for $449, a whole $100 cheaper. In the UK, you can grab one for just £500 at Amazon, which really puts it up against the new price of the 512GB Quest 3. Any direction you look in, you have amazing opportunities to get into VR gaming at the moment. All of these headsets are worth the money, and as a lover of this technology, I couldn't be happier to say that. Competition is great for any industry, and since this has always been prohibitively expensive hardware, all of these discounts mean that more people will be able to get their heads in a visor. If that's the case now, I can't wait to see what Black Friday VR headset deals and Black Friday Meta Quest deals have in store. You can personalize your headsets by checking out the best Meta Quest accessories. If you want to widen your gaming library, check out the best gaming PCs or the best gaming laptops. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

Title: 5 Leadership Skills Every Leader And Manager Needs In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/10/02/5-leadership-skills-every-leader-and-manager-needs-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T16:00:53Z
Full Content:
As we wind down 2024 and look ahead to 2025, it's important to reflect on the trends and shifts that ... [+] have occurred in the workforce this year so we as leaders can equip ourselves with the necessary skills to drive our organizations forward What a year 2024 has been. This year has been the year of actioned AI (artificial intelligence) implementation and integration; shocking announcements of employers forcing their teams to return to the office on a full-time basis; more layoffs from Big Tech and major consulting and financial firms and companies; hybrid work models gaining traction amid the flexible and remote work debate; and an increased number of organizations investing heavily in their upskilling programs, leading to reduced barriers for employees seeking to develop their careers. In light of this, what leadership skills should you prioritize as a senior business leader (and even as a middle manager) in your career development as you prepare for what 2025 might have in store for your team, department, or overall organization? The first and one of the most essential leadership skills any senior leader or manager needs to develop for 2025 is emotional intelligence, also referred to as EQ. A recent scientific research study published in the Revista de Gestão Social e Ambiental journal concluded that emotional intelligence in leaders correlates to favorable organizational cultures, high job satisfaction levels, and strong employee engagement. According to the same study, emotional intelligence in leaders manifests itself through traits and competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, interpersonal skills, and relationship management skills. Notably, it would be virtually impossible to say that you have a high level of EQ without excelling in communication skills or being self-aware, both in and out of the workplace. It is fairly evident that with the workforce undergoing the various changes we have witnessed, such as AI, restructuring after layoffs, the increased use of freelancers to supplement the talent gap in the workforce, and hybrid working, leaders and managers will need to up their game when it comes to knowing how to manage change effectively. Leaders at all levels of an organization need to champion change and the relevant upskilling needed for those changes to be successfully implemented (more on upskilling later). They should also be proactive in guiding teams through transitions while creating an atmosphere of psychological safety. Career resilience is critical for leaders and especially for middle managers, whose roles are being ... [+] eliminated in a bid for flattened organizational structures While most people commonly think of resilience and adaptability as necessary for leaders from an organizational point of view, this article approaches resilience from an entirely different angle: a leader's own career growth. Just a few days ago, Business Insider released an article titled, "It's a Tough Time To Be A Manager In Tech," which highlighted the disturbing realities of leading in the tech industry, brought to light recently in the wake of companies such as Amazon and Meta flattening their organizational structures in a bid to streamline their processes and be more efficient. With organizations eliminating middle managers from the talent structure, this is the time more than ever for middle managers to develop resilience for their own careers' sake. While being a middle manager in a tech firm (especially in Big Tech) might be seen as a dream job, it's essential not to get cushy, comfortable, and too relaxed in your role. Remember that you are easily disposable at this point, and your job is at risk. Therefore, always have a plan B for your job and career, keep your options open, and consider other career paths to contribute with your skills, such as consulting, freelancing, or pursuing a middle management role in another industry or organization. In Statista's analysis of skills on the rise between 2023 and 2027, based on a survey of more than 800 global companies (representing over 11.3 million employees worldwide), technological literacy was listed as the third most essential skill, with 68% of employers considering this to be the case. If leaders wish to implement sweeping AI changes across their organization and encourage its ethical use, they must model this AI-positive behavior. Leading by example, in this case, means educating yourself as a senior leader or middle manager about AI, Generative AI, the terminology surrounding it, practical use cases for your organization and the industry/market you operate in, understanding the risks associated with it, and knowing how to use it ethically so you can partner with AI software developers, upskill your workforce internally, and hire the right people to enable this integration to happen. It would help if you also remained consistently aware of emerging technological trends so you can be in the know before things happen on a mass scale. This way, you can prepare for change before it affects your organization in a significant way. Last but not least, resourcefulness and creativity are another essential leadership skill you will need for 2025. This has become more critical than ever since the introduction of artificial intelligence, highlighting the need for human reasoning and judgment so that they can be used effectively to augment work rather than entirely replace it. "More than 70% of companies surveyed consider creative thinking and analytical thinking to be the skills most expected to rise in importance between 2023 and 2027," states Statista. "Indeed, cognitive skills are growing in importance most rapidly due to increasing complexities in the workplace." While AI excels in administrative tasks and routine work at the basic level and can be used to help generate ideas, it needs help solving real problems. You will need to use AI to boost your innate curiosity, out-of-the-box thinking, and innovation. Technological literacy is the third most essential skill between now and 2027, according to more ... [+] than two-thirds of companies globally When you focus on developing leadership skills such as EQ, change management, career resilience, tech and AI literacy, and creativity/resourcefulness, you'll be better equipped to handle whatever 2025 brings to your workforce and organization. You will emerge as a confident and successful leader—setting you and your organization ahead of competitors and enabling productivity and real value to stakeholders. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The New Power of New York List 2024
URL: https://variety.com/lists/new-power-new-york-list-2024/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T16:00:00Z

What is power? Is it the speed with which an A-lister returns your calls, the ease in nabbing a reservation at the hottest Manhattan restaurant or how many times you appear on Page Six? Maybe it’s something ineffable, but more impactful: the ability to define and shape culture. That’s what you see in the movers and shakers in the media business, like CNN’s Mark Thompson and ABC News’ Almin Karamehmedovic, who are spotlighted here. And it’s certainly evident in creative geniuses like Heidi Gardner, a breakout star on “SNL”; Cole Escola, who has lit up Broadway with the rococo comedy “Oh, Mary!”; and Clairo, an indie rock darling. In all, this collection of New Yorkers have at least one thing in common — they’re making the most of their respective moments. Each brings to the table a unique set of talents, and each is leaving an imprint on their respective medium. What starts in New York changes the world. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy “You Hurt My Feelings” and the Anne Hathaway thriller “Eileen” were among the recent successes for Likely Story, the production company Bregman and Azpiazu founded in 2006. Since then, they’ve become a presence at Sundance — with three of their movies premiering at the fest’s 2023 edition. One upcoming project is “Power Ballad,” directed by John Carney (“Once”) and starring Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas. Since its 2021 rebranding, CBS’ morning broadcast has been fueled by its hosts’ chemistry. And while co-hosts Gayle King and Tony Dokoupil have long been familiar to CBS viewers, it’s Burleson — a former football player and sports journalist, and a sometime rapper under the moniker New Balance — who’s been the current panel’s darling. As a key member of WME’s theater department, Buzzetti represents many of Broadway’s biggest entertainers. He started his career in 1996 at the Ambrosio-Mortimer agency before joining Gersh two years later. Since Buzzetti joined WME in 2010, everyone from Lin-Manuel Miranda to David Lindsay-Abaire to Quiara Alegría Hudes has turned to him for his dealmaking prowess. Other clients, which include the productions “Avenue Q,” “In the Heights,” “The Book of Mormon” and “Hamilton,” have won Tonys and gone beyond Broadway, too, landing Oscars and Emmys. If you don’t recognize the name, your kids do. That’s because Cenat conquered Twitch with comedy livestreams, gaming marathons and celebrity collabs that reach more than 13 million users. The social media impresario’s livestreams with the likes of Kevin Hart and Ice Spice — some lasting for 24 hours — are hugely popular with Gen Z and Gen Alpha viewers. Cenat also has ventured into more traditional sides of the entertainment industry, releasing music and appearing in “Good Burger 2.” After Trevor Noah’s tenure ended, it seemed unclear what “The Daily Show” would do to move forward. One solution was to play the hits: Popular former host Stewart has returned, one night per week, through the election. Another, though, was to rely on team spirit: The regular suite of hosts — Chieng, Klepper, Kosta and Lydic — have distinguished themselves with sharp perspectives and insights. One of the fastest-rising artists in indie music, Claire Cottrill — aka Clairo — became a face of bedroom pop with her 2019 album “Immunity,” which featured the standout songs “Bags” and “Sofia.” She then channeled ’70s folk on her sophomore effort, “Sling,” and soft rock and soul on 2024’s “Charm.” Over the years, Cottrill has moved between the city and more spacious enclaves in upstate New York and Massachusetts, but her sound still permeates the five boroughs’ indie-rock corners. Last month, she played a five-night residency at Webster Hall. Adjmi got the idea for “Stereophonic” while listening to Led Zeppelin’s “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” on a plane. A decade or so later, his recording studio-set drama became the most Tony-nominated play in Broadway history (winning five). The three-hour show follows a Fleetwood Mac-like band as the members labor over their second album. They fall in and out of love; feud and reconcile; indulge in drugs, booze and egotism; and, somehow, amid all the disharmony, create beautiful music. Lately, J. Crew has been setting trends, not chasing them. A couple years ago, for instance, downtown scenesters one might never have expected to wear a mall brand were abuzz over the company’s giant-fit chinos. Credit for the brand’s menswear line goes to creative director Babenzien, who brings an edgy, gritty sensibility made familiar by SoHo’s Noah, which he founded, and by Supreme, the global streetwear colossus. As the head of FilmNation, Basner navigated the treacherous world of indie-film financing to become one of the entertainment business’s most influential figures. He has survived one pandemic and two labor strikes, along with changing tastes, to produce some of the year’s most exciting movies. They include “Conclave,” a Vatican thriller that’s generating Oscar heat, and “Anora,” a comedy about a sex worker in Brighton Beach that nabbed the Palme d’Or. The “Summer House” cast members came onto the series already friends; now, they’re building an empire. Berner, whose stand-up special “We Ride at Dawn” recently premiered on Netflix, and DeSorbo, host the podcast “Giggly Squad,” which launched in 2020. They also announced their forthcoming book of relationship advice, “How to Giggle: A Guide to Taking Life Less Seriously,” and are on an extensive national tour, sharing their loopy perspectives on life and love with their many devoted fans. In April, Amazon hired Bhatia, previously a senior executive at NBCUniversal, as vice president of global video advertising. It was a sign of the company’s wish to make more inroads on Madison Avenue by tapping someone steeped in traditional television advertising. All eyes are on Bhatia, who is well versed in the kinds of newer audience data that can help brands target the consumers they need to reach; the question is, can he bring the techniques he developed in more traditional media to Amazon? It shouldn’t have worked. Yet “The Outsiders,” a rough-and-tumble musical adaptation of S.E. Hinton’s gritty coming-of-age novel and Francis Ford Coppola’s film, has become a Broadway smash. Grant, playing Pony Boy, provides the story’s bruised spirit as a greaser from the wrong side of the tracks, and Taymor, the show’s director, staged a rain-soaked rumble that was so dazzling it helped “The Outsiders” capture the Tony for best musical. Houser lives in Brooklyn, but as co-founder and president of Rockstar Games and executive producer of the “Grand Theft Auto” series, he’s associated with the fictional city of Los Santos, the Los Angeles-inspired backdrop of “Grand Theft Auto V.” It’s the second-bestselling video game of all time, behind “Minecraft.” Rockstar also makes the blockbuster game series “Red Dead Redemption,” but all eyes are on the long-awaited “Grand Theft Auto VI,” due in 2025. Jacobs-Jenkins is the playwright behind last season’s hit “Appropriate,” a darkly comedic family drama starring Sarah Paulson, Corey Stoll and Elle Fanning. It was nominated for eight Tonys and won three, including best revival. He’s returning to Broadway with “Purpose,” another epic family drama. Described as a “moralistic satire,” the show follows an influential family that’s become a pillar of Black American politics. In the hands of Jacobs-Jenkins, “Purpose” is poised to be another can’t-miss Broadway event. Few filmmakers of any genre have as fertile a creative mind as Gibney. He’s helmed documentaries about Boris Becker, Paul Simon and “The Sopranos.” Gibney, while often focused on the famous, has also investigated secretive and challenging organizations like WikiLeaks and the Church of Scientology. His Jigsaw Productions, backed by Imagine Entertainment, promises to only grow more prolific. A five-time Grammy winner, Glasper is one of the leading forces bridging jazz with hip-hop. He played on Kendrick Lamar’s landmark album “To Pimp a Butterfly,” and has worked with artists like Common, Anderson .Paak and Q-Tip. With his sixth annual residency, Glasper is set to take over New York’s fabled Blue Note jazz club for the month of October, once again delivering the most exciting shows in Greenwich Village. Since joining “Saturday Night Live” in 2017, Gardner has emerged as a genuine breakout; her unscripted laughing in a 2024 “Beavis and Butt-Head” sketch went viral in part because Gardner’s characters tend to have a certain frustrated dignity. Gardner lives in New York but often reps her hometown of Kansas City on the show — notably when Travis Kelce hosted last year. Germanotta is best known professionally for co-founding the anti-bullying nonprofit Born This Way Foundation. Personally, she’s best known for her connection to the organization’s other founder — her daughter Stefani Germanotta, aka Lady Gaga. Gaga’s mother co-owns the well-loved Upper West Side restaurant Joanne Trattoria and advocates on behalf of young people’s mental health. The “13 Reasons Why” breakout recently stripped down to his skivvies as the, er, face of Calvin Klein. When he’s not burning up red carpets or anchoring photo shoots in glossy fashion magazines, Flynn has a burgeoning acting career, one that saw him rocking an old-timey mustache in the Lincoln assassination drama “Manhunt.” Next, he’ll try to scare audiences’ pants off appearing opposite Brian Cox and Edie Falco in the poltergeist thriller “The Parenting.” Starting off as Martin Scorsese’s assistant, Frechette has spent her career on film sets from “Shutter Island” to “The Wolf of Wall Street.” More recently, she stepped into a producing role for Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions, landing credits on his “Personality Crisis: One Night Only” and “Stories of a Generation — With Pope Francis.” In 2023, Frechette was an executive producer on the three-and-a-half-hour epic “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which went on to earn 10 Oscar nominations. Formerly a top executive at companies both sprawling and established (AOL Time Warner) and lean and scrappy (RadicalMedia), Friedman struck out on his own with Bungalow Media + Entertainment. The company takes a boutique approach to the TV shows, movies and digital media it gets involved with — and being selective pays. Recently, Bungalow launched several projects, including CBS’ “13 Days in Ferguson,” a look at the aftermath of Michael Brown’s killing, and Max’s “Serving the Hamptons,” a reality show set in a Southampton eatery. It’s been a bumpy year for Cohen, the real estate scion and film lover whose company defaulted on a loan that left his art-house cinema chains on the auction block. But Cohen Media Group, the indie label that Cohen controls, had some wins. “Io Capitano,” a searing drama about immigration, was nominated for an Oscar for best international feature, and the company released “Merchant Ivory,” a documentary about the cinematic duo, to raves. As YouTube’s head of TV, film and sports partnerships, Conkling oversees multibillion-dollar deals with broadcast and cable networks and sports leagues. She was instrumental in YouTube TV’s new pact with NFL Sunday Ticket, making the company the exclusive home of every football game in the U.S. In doing so, YouTube TV wrestled the must-see NFL bonanza — a favorite among super fans and sports bettors — away from DirecTV after 28 years. A nice Jewish boy walks into a white-nationalist meeting. What sounds like the setup to a dicey joke is the premise of “Just for Us,” Edelman’s very funny solo show about the time he attended a local Nazi rally after receiving antisemitic threats online. After a stint on Broadway, a taped version of the performance aired on HBO and won an Emmy. Escola has endeared themselves to audiences through YouTube videos as well as roles on television shows like “Difficult People.” But the 37-year-old is having their highest-profile moment yet as the writer and star of the Broadway phenom “Oh, Mary!” After a twice-extended downtown run, the play — which imagines Mary Todd Lincoln as an alcoholic aspiring cabaret singer terrorizing her husband while he tries to win the Civil War — is the hottest ticket in town. London-born and Oxford-educated, Thompson’s no stranger to New York: Among the postings in his long career are a role as the CEO of The New York Times Co., where he helped transform and modernize the paper’s presence online. At CNN, where he began in October 2023, Thompson stepped into a chaotic situation after the firing of Chris Licht; this summer, he announced plans to overhaul the newsroom, including layoffs. Comedy fans have long been familiar with Torres’ sensibility from “Saturday Night Live,” where he worked as a writer from 2016 to 2019, or from his show “Los Espookys”; his signature is a sort of loopy surreality, with tinges of camp and wordplay. This year, he created the HBO series “Fantasmas” and the A24 movie “Problemista,” both of which draw their humor from Torres’ experiences as a Salvadoran immigrant navigating life in New York. The Hollywood power player who co-founded the management company Untitled Entertainment also produces films and shows like “The Kill Room” and “Ray Donovan.” All the while, Weinberg, who transitioned decades ago from publicist to talent manager, has been keeping clients like Demi Moore (“The Substance”), Maya Hawke (“Inside Out 2”), Zoë Kravitz (“Blink Twice,” “The Batman”) and Jean Smart (“Hacks”) booked and busy. When the team behind the Tony-winning “Merrily We Roll Along” wanted to share the onstage magic with a wider audience, they turned to RadicalMedia; the company filmed performances of “Hamilton” to produce a beloved movie, and it will now do the same for “Merrily.” Thirty years after Radical was founded, Kamen and Scherma have kept growing the company. In addition to producing programs such as a History Channel JFK docuseries, Radical oversees marketing campaigns for companies ranging from Apple to Adidas. Taking the reins as the new president of ABC News, Karamehme dovic oversees the network’s many TV news titles, including “World News Tonight With David Muir,” “Good Morning America,” “The View,” “20/20” and “Nightline.” By the time he moved to New York in 2008, the 16-time Emmy winner had garnered a reputation as an intrepid field reporter, embedding himself with the U.S. Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and traveling to the country to document the fight against ISIS. The Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures chief serves as a bridge between Hollywood and Broadway, finding classic films that can inspire hit shows and vice versa. As a driving force behind “Beetlejuice: The Musical,” Kaufman proved there was life in the ghostly franchise, which gave the studio confidence when it came time to make a sequel to the original film. He also helped turn “The Outsiders,” a musical adaptation of a 40-year-old movie, into a zeitgeist-y stage smash. As Kevin Durant’s longtime manager as well as co-founder and CEO of Boardroom, Kleiman serves as an ambassador between the NBA and Hollywood. Boardroom produces daily newsletters as well as film and TV projects like “Swagger,” an Apple TV+ drama loosely inspired by Durant’s early life; and “NYC Point Gods,” a Showtime docuseries that examines how a group of ’80s and ’90s basketball legends reinvented the game. The madness of the 2024 election cycle has been a boon for cable news, including the women whose insights and intellects fuel MSNBC. Liberal viewers have likely needed reassurance or clarity at various points along the bumpy journey that brought us presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and the cabler’s veterans have an authority built over years of covering the turbulent political scene. Moon’s rise is straight out of a storybook. After graduating from high school in 2020, the 22-year-old was cast as a stand-in for Alicia Keys in “Hell’s Kitchen,” a jukebox musical inspired by the “Empire State of Mind” singer’s upbringing in Manhattan. Critics raved about her soaring voice and commanding stage presence. Then Moon won the Tony for best actress in a musical, becoming one of the youngest recipients of the award. Before becoming the executive producer of Sherri Shepherd’s talk show, Murray was a journalist and on-air personality, including on the nationally syndicated “Tom Joyner Morning Show.” Now, in addition to his producing duties on “Sherri,” which replaced “The Wendy Williams Show,” he’s bringing a shot of pop-culture energy as an on-camera commentator. As the ambitious and tightly wound trader Harper Stern on HBO’s financial drama “Industry,” Myha’la has provided the show its sense of intense competition. In its third season, the series has become a lifeline for those who miss the gamesmanship of “Succession,” and Myha’la has leveled up; she also appeared in the 2022 feature “Bodies Bodies Bodies” and the 2023 Netflix sensation “Leave the World Behind.” A lot is riding on James Gunn’s DC cinematic universe reboot, particularly after the last one imploded in spectacular fashion (cause of death: “Justice League”). And to get it right, the DC Studios chief enlisted Ana Nogueira, an actress turned scribe, to write “Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.” The film, which Gunn describes as a “science fiction epic,” will debut in 2026 and pick up where his next movie, “Superman,” leaves off. After that, Nogueira will write a “Teen Titans” film. As CEO of Jay-Z’s multimillion-dollar entertainment powerhouse Roc Nation, Perez oversees the careers of titans like Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Megan Thee Stallion and Fat Joe. As head of the company in charge of programming the Super Bowl halftime show — for which it has won five Emmys — Perez placed clients, including Shakira and Rihanna, on the world’s biggest stage. She’s also helped Roc Nation lean into its charitable efforts, and was credited by Lil Uzi Vert for encouraging the rapper to seek treatment for a Xanax addiction. The ABC News correspondent is recognizable to TV viewers from his appearances on “Good Morning America.” But this year, Reeve shares a more personal side with the release of “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.” The film draws on home movies that prominently feature Reeve and his half-siblings, Alexandra Reeve and Matthew Reeve, interacting with their famous dad both before and after the horse-riding accident that left him paralyzed, inspiring him to become an advocate for people with disabilities. Bring tissues. The liberal voice on Fox News can be an uncomfortable position to occupy. But you’ve got to hand it to Tarlov, a Democratic Party political strategist and rotating co-host of the panel show “The Five”: She can take care of herself. Tarlov is plainspoken and direct in defending Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. As the conservative-leaning panel’s dissenting voice, she’s the one saying things the network’s core audience doesn’t want to hear. “The View” is one of the Teflon brands on daytime — for all the reinventions and cast changes, the core idea and the rock-solid fandom remains the same. As executive producer, Teta is entrusted with making sure the show stays true to its identity, including continuing to generate watercooler moments and booking splashy interviews with newsmakers. Thomas parlayed his career as a child actor on shows like “Victorious” and “iCarly” into making music with some of the industry’s biggest names — including one of his former co-stars, Ariana Grande. The Brooklyn-born artist scored writing credits on the pop star’s “Yours Truly” and “Positions” albums, plus production work with Drake, Post Malone and Jack Harlow — and also makes his own music. In 2024, he won a Grammy as a songwriter on SZA’s “Snooze.” A manager, sales agent and lawyer, Sloss is a different kind of multi-hyphenate. He doesn’t write movies, or act in and direct them, but he brings different creative forces together. The Cinetic Media founder is a sounding board for indie mavericks like Richard Linklater and Todd Haynes, as well as a dealmaker, helping sell and promote their movies. New York is still the center of indie film, and Sloss, who lives and works here, is part of its beating heart. Playing George Russell, a rapacious robber baron with a secret soft side, on HBO’s “The Gilded Age” turned Spector into the period drama’s unlikely heartthrob. The second season ended with a rare moment of marital discord between George and his wife, Bertha, who are usually in lockstep in their quest to conquer New York society. When the new season debuts in 2025, viewers will learn if the Russell marriage survives or if George becomes TV’s most eligible bachelor. Formerly the host of CNN’s media-criticism show “Reliable Sources,” Stelter was laid off by the network in 2022 due to cost-cutting. Now, after two years, during which time he wrote the Fox News takedown “Network of Lies,” Stelter returns to write for and appear on CNN. Stelter’s varied career includes an executive producer credit on “The Morning Show,” but he’s best known lately for sounding the alarm on air about the dangers of disinformation. Stern is managing director of Playground, the company that’s worked on some of Broadway’s buzziest plays and musicals, like “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” “Dear Evan Hansen,” “New York, New York” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” He’s also worked extensively as a producer on projects such as Kenneth Lonergan’s “Howards End” for BBC, the Kelsey Grammer-led “The Last Tycoon” and “Rosemary’s Baby” with Zoe Saldaña. Three decades after it was launched to help revive lower Manhattan in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Tribeca Festival continues to celebrate the city and its connection to cinema. Rosenthal, who co-founded the event with Robert De Niro, has kept Tribeca relevant by expanding its influence beyond film and into virtual reality and gaming. When freed from festival duties, Rosenthal is an in-demand producer, with credits that include “Wag the Dog” and “The Irishman.” Schoenbrun is emerging as one of their generation’s most innovative and surreal filmmakers, with this year’s “I Saw the TV Glow” breaking out at Sundance and hitting theaters nationwide. “I Saw the TV Glow” is a Lynchian allegory about isolated teenagers seeking connection through a shared favorite show; Schoenbrun, who is trans and nonbinary, drew from their own experiences, including their youthful interest in fantasy TV. As head of AMC Networks Film Group, Shooman runs both IFC Films, a distributor of art-house films, and Shudder, a streaming service that traffics in horror and slasher movies. That unique vantage point has inspired Shooman to back offbeat films, such as the occult thriller “Late Night With the Devil,” that have become some of the company’s biggest theatrical successes at a time when the box office has been contracting.

Inman Connect Whether it’s refining your business model, mastering new technologies, or discovering strategies to capitalize on the next market surge, Inman Connect New York will prepare you to take bold steps forward. The Next Chapter is about to begin. Be part of it. Join us and thousands of real estate leaders Jan. 22-24, 2025. The amount of money collected for homesellers through the National Association of Realtors’ proposed settlement is set to grow by more than $30 million. On Monday, attorneys for homeseller plaintiffs in a major commission-related lawsuit known as Sitzer | Burnett submitted a filing asking the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri to preliminarily approve settlements reached with 15 non-Realtor multiple listing services and 13 large brokerages that chose to opt-in to NAR’s deal in order to release them from antitrust claims. TAKE THE INMAN INTEL INDEX SURVEY FOR SEPTEMBER “Together, these ‘opting in’ MLSs and brokerages have agreed to pay an additional $30,587,754 in compensation to the Class — creating, in connection with the NAR Settlement, a total monetary settlement fund of at least $448,587,754 plus certain interest for the benefit of the Class,” the filing reads. “Each opt-in entity either paid the amount reflected in the NAR Settlement agreement formula … or an amount that was reached after a review of the entity’s internal financial statements and arms-length negotiations.” The court granted the motion on Tuesday, Oct. 1. June 18 was the deadline for Realtor-affiliated and non-Realtor-affiliated MLSs to opt into the NAR deal. Virtually all affiliated MLSs opted in and will have to pay nothing under the terms, unlike non-Realtor MLSs who will have to pay outright under an opt-in formula or enter mediation to determine an amount. The 15 non-Realtor MLSs agreed to pay $6.2 million combined, according to the filing: This amount is somewhat higher than an Inman review of hundreds of MLSs previously found in June. At the time, about half of broker-owned MLSs had opted in, with some who had opted out stating their rules are different from those that have attracted antitrust litigation. Ten of the MLSs who had opted in chose to fork over at least $5,383,800 total while eight of the opt-in MLSs were still in mediation then. Because not all of the broker-owned MLSs who opted in are listed in the Sept. 30 filing, there may be other settlements in the offing, including with the Real Estate Board of New York’s RLS, Brooklyn MLS, Central New York Information Service, and Greater Southern MLS. The 13 brokerages listed in the filing agreed to pay more than $24 million combined with Shorewest Realtors agreeing to pay more than a quarter of the sum, a very precise $6,923,153.89: The plaintiffs asked that the court allow the companies opting-in to join the case in order to participate in the settlement and approval process and also that the court reaffirm that the opt-in settlements are preliminarily approved as part of the preliminary approval of NAR’s settlement. “Plaintiffs’ allegations involve allegations of a nationwide conspiracy and a resulting series of anticompetitive transactions,” the filing reads. “The allegations made by plaintiffs in various actions share numerous common questions of law and fact with the existing action, including because they allegedly involve the same or similar conduct at issue in the underlying action, and are directly related to approval of the NAR Settlement.” The law firms for the plaintiffs also requested that the court address the final approval of the opt-in settlements at the same Nov. 26 hearing already set for the final approval of the NAR settlement.

On 10/4/24, American Express, NetApp, and Helios Technologies will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. American Express will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.70 on 11/8/24, NetApp, will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.52 on 10/23/24, and Helios Technologies will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.09 on 10/21/24. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of AXP's recent stock price of $268.60, this dividend works out to approximately 0.26%, so look for shares of American Express to trade 0.26% lower — all else being equal — when AXP shares open for trading on 10/4/24. Similarly, investors should look for NTAP to open 0.43% lower in price and for HLIO to open 0.19% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for AXP, NTAP, and HLIO, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. American Express: AXP NetApp: NTAP Helios Technologies: HLIO In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.04% for American Express Co., 1.71% for NetApp, Inc., and 0.76% for Helios Technologies Inc.

Title: Netflix Stock: Will The Momentum Slow?

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 01: (L-R) Andrew Fried, David Gelb, Nancy Silverton, and Brian ... [+] McGinn attend Netflix's "Chef's Table: Noodles" event at Funke on October 01, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Netflix) Netflix stock has had a pretty good year, rising by almost 45% year-to-date as the company successfully navigated a brief subscriber decline post-Covid-19. This compares to rival Disney, which has gained about 7% over the same time frame. Netflix is poised to report its Q3 FY’24 results on October 17, reporting on a quarter that is likely to see the company continue to expand its business led by its ad-supported plans and crack down on password sharing. We expect earnings to come in at about $5.10 per share, roughly in line with consensus estimates, and up by 37% compared to the last year. Revenues are likely to come in at about $9.85 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates, rising 14.5% compared to the last year. So what are some of the trends that could drive Netflix results? Netflix is expected to see its paid net additions for the quarter lower on a year-over-year basis as the company sees a tough comparison with Q3 2023, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing. The password-sharing crackdown essentially forced customers to pay for users outside their households or sign up for a new account. However, the company should continue to benefit from its ad-supported tier which is enabling it to attract more price-sensitive customers with a price of just $7 per month in the U.S. The total subscribers on this tier grew by about 34% compared to the year-ago period. Moreover, the ad-supported plan is expected to generate more revenue per user than some of Netflix’s ad-free plans as incremental ad revenue more than offsets the discount offered on the ad tier. Over the last quarter, Netflix said that it was discontinuing its Basic ad-free plan while migrating users to its entry-level ad-supported plan, which offers better video quality and has a lower price point. That said, Netflix forecasts that its global average revenue per member will be roughly flat year over year in Q3 due to currency-related headwinds and potentially higher net adds in international markets where monthly pricing is lower than the U.S. Netflix has been increasingly focusing on boosting its margins. For Q3, operating margins are guided at 28.1%%, marking an increase from about 22% in the year-ago quarter. The margin expansion is driven by revenue growth that outpaces operating costs due to economies of scale and also due to potentially lower content spending growth. Netflix’s continued price increases are also likely helping profitability. Margins are also likely to trend higher on a sequential basis. The increase in NFLX stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NFLX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Although we think that Netflix stock could move slightly higher if it beats earnings, we believe the stock is overvalued. At the current market price of about $707 per share, Netflix trades at almost 37x forward earnings, which is a bit pricey in our view. While Netflix’s recent performance has been strong, consumer spending growth appears to be slowing down Moreover, things also remain mixed in the labor market, with the U.S. economy creating slightly fewer jobs than expected during August. These trends could weigh on players such as Netflix who are dependent on strong consumer confidence. Netflix could also see subscriber growth cool, as the impact of its accelerated subscriber adds coming from the twin impact of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers continue to normalize, reducing momentum for the stock. We have a $572 price estimate for Netflix, which is about 20% below the market price. See our analysis Netflix Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Netflix. Also, check out the analysis of Netflix Revenue for more details on how Netflix revenues are trending. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy following the recent rate cuts, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: 6.5 Trillion Reasons Why This 6% Dividend Will Soar

Dollars wave isolated on white Right now, there’s $6.5 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines—and a big slice of it is about to drop straight into a select group of dividend stocks. We’re going to “front run” that cash wave today—and set ourselves up for income (I’m talking 6%+ yields here) and gains as this cash wave starts to build. In a sec, I’ll name two dividend-payers sitting right in the path of this freed-up cash. One is a true “dividend unicorn,” shelling out an outsized 6% payout that grows. The other has doubled its dividend in just the last five years. Let’s start by breaking down that $6.5 trillion figure: It’s the amount of cash in parked money-market funds today. Here’s why a big chunk of it is likely to shake loose: Rates on money-market funds float, and the Fed Funds rate—which Jay Powell, of course, just started slashing—has a strong pull on them. As yields on money-market funds (and savings accounts and the like) fall, more “new money” will bypass them and go into dividend stocks instead. Meantime, today’s money-market investors will “stretch” for higher yields and payout growth. Here again, dividend stocks will be the beneficiaries. It’s already happening: Money Market Inflows Above you can see the rapid growth in money-market holdings since the Fed started raising rates in early 2022. Since the second quarter of that year—or about two years ago—the total has jumped a staggering 30%, to just over $6.5 trillion. You can also see (at the top right), that the inflow has slowed. It’s no coincidence that’s happened as yields on money-market funds like the popular Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor Fund (VMFXX) flatline: Money Market Yields You can see the fund’s yield stair-step higher as the Fed hiked rates to 5.25% to 5.5%, then go flat as the Fed held rates from mid-2023 till this month’s 50-point cut. Let me be clear: I’m not saying the entire $6.5 trillion is going to go into stocks. Plenty of folks will always be drawn by the promise of a guaranteed principal. But even if money-market holdings simply drop back to where they were two years ago, we’re talking about $1.5-trillion making a move here. And that doesn’t include new money that bypasses these lower-paying money-market funds. Or any freed-up cash in savings accounts and CDs as they mature. In fact, this transition is already happening, and in a surprising place, too: riskier high-yield, or “junk,” bonds. Check out these big gains from the corporate-bond closed-end funds (CEFs) we held in my Contrarian Income Report service from November 2023 to now: Bond Funds Deliver These are big moves for bond funds, especially for our two municipal-bond funds, NEA and NAD. These gains happened in lockstep with the slowing flow into money-market funds, and this trade is still working in our favor—though after these funds’ strong runs, I do rate them as “holds” today. While we wait, though, let’s dive into those two dividend payers I mentioned earlier. Our first stock, payment processor Mastercard (MA) is in the pole position not only as more cash moves into stocks but from another shift few people are talking about. I’m talking about the rising odds we’ll not get a soft or hard landing in the economy—but no landing at all. In that setup, the economy ticks along and inflation comes back. Not great, I know, and we discussed it in detail last Tuesday. The upshot is that government spending is out of control, outrunning tax receipts by almost $2 trillion. Give me an extra $2 trillion and I’ll show you a strong economy! But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation—and overwhelm Jay Powell. This is one reason why those bond funds I mentioned earlier are holds for now. As I said, the trade is still going our way, but we’re watching it closely, as any move toward higher rates would hurt bond prices (as rates and bond prices move inversely). But the other part of this story—a humming economy—is great for Mastercard (MA), which takes a slice of each payment that rolls down its network. And talk about pricing power: The credit-card market is basically controlled by four companies: Visa (V), with a 53% share, Mastercard (MA), at 24%, American Express (AXP), at 20% and Discover Financial Services (DFS). Mastercard doesn’t win many income fans with its tiny 0.5% yield, but payout growth is the story here: This dividend has doubled in the last five years, pulling up the share price with it: MA Dividend Magnet If you’ve followed me for a while, you know I talk a lot about the “Dividend Magnet”—a stock’s tendency to track its payout higher. You can see it in action here. The current gap between the two is a snapshot of the stock’s upside as it “snaps back” to the payout. The low payout ratio (Mastercard pays just 21% of free cash flow as dividends) virtually locks in further growth, even if I’m wrong and the economy does slow from here. Mastercard is a great stock, but let’s be honest, it’ll take years for its payout growth to inflate the yield on a buy made today. That’s where casino landlord Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) comes in. Before you say it, yes, I know a casino stock might sound like an odd pick to attract money-market-fund investors. But I’m pretty sure a growing 6% dividend won’t take long to convince them! And hey, if folks really are migrating to junk bonds from money-market funds, why not a stock like GLPI? Plus, the stock has lots of strengths that make it far from a gamble (sorry, couldn’t resist). For one, it’s diversified across the country, with 65 casinos in 20 states. That’s key, because if the job market continues to slow, concerned workers might cancel their Vegas trip, but they’ll likely still hit up their local casino. Second GLPI’s tenants are signed under “triple-net” leases that provide a stable, predictable income stream. Moreover, under these leases, the tenant pays the full cost of running and maintaining the company’s properties. Which is great news—can you imagine what this electricity bill looks like? But the real standout for us income-seekers is that as a real estate investment trust (REIT), GLPI is exempt from corporate taxes so long as it pays out 90% of its profits as dividends. The savings help fund that high payout. And as mentioned, GLPI has been quick to share its rising cash flow through payout growth—including special dividends (the spikes and dips in the chart below): GLPI Dividend Magnet The REIT’s regular dividend was cut in the 2020 lockdowns, but that’s understandable and the cut was modest: just 14%. And GLPI quickly got back to its winning ways, boosting the payout since. And as with Mastercard, we’ve got a powerful Dividend Magnet working for us here, too. More payout hikes are likely. GLPI’s revenue rose 6.7% in the latest quarter, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, the key REIT profitability metric) rose 5.6%. The company also pays an estimated 81% of the midpoint of its forecast 2024 AFFO as dividends, a reasonable amount for a REIT. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Will Ford's Stock Recover

GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 21: A Ford F-150 Lariat PowerBoost ybrid pickup truck is displayed for ... [+] sale at a Ford dealership on August 21, 2024 in Glendale, California. Ford announced it is upending its electric vehicle (EV) strategy for North American vehicles to focus on hybrids, affordability, and longer ranges. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Ford stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, compared to fellow U.S. auto giant GM which has gained close to 29% over the same period. The underperformance of Ford comes despite a reasonably healthy financial performance in recent years, with revenues and cash flows expanding. Ford’s valuation is very attractive, with the stock trading at a mere 6x 2024 consensus earnings. While Ford stock has actually risen in the last 3-years, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 137% in 2021, -42% in 2022, and 16% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could F face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We value Ford stock at about $14 per share, which is around 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis on Ford Valuation: Expensive Or Cheap for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Ford. For more information on Ford’s business model and revenue trends, check out our dashboard on Ford Revenue: How Ford Makes Money. So why exactly is Ford stock underperforming and what are some of the trends that could drive a recovery? Higher Warranty Costs Ford recently posted a weaker-than-expected set of Q2 2024 results. Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at $0.47 per share, below consensus estimates and a 35% decline from the $0.72 the company reported in Q2 2023. This is in contrast with GM which beat expectations. Although Ford saw revenues grow by about 6% over the last quarter, its earnings were hit by an increase in warranty repair costs amid issues with cars built in 2021 or earlier. Ford has faced multiple quality issues with its vehicles in the past years driving up the warranty costs. Moreover, these costs are sometimes recognized suddenly, without warning, leading to weaker-than-expected results. For Q2 for example, earnings fell almost 30% short of estimates as Ford’s $800 million spike in costs caught investors by surprise. Now Ford is working on improving the quality of its vehicles, with the company noting that it was now testing vehicles to failure in order to discover quality problems. However, the process could take over a year to reflect on warranty cost improvements. Rocky EV Transition, Mixed Economic Outlook Separately, there have also been concerns about the demand environment. Ford saw its overall volumes for Q2 rise by just about 1% year-over-year amid high interest rates which have made vehicle financing expensive. Consumer spending has also been easing in the U.S. The average price paid for new vehicles declined by 3% for the first six months of this year, compared to last year, per research firm J.D. Power meaning that the pricing power that automakers saw post the Covid-19 pandemic is easing. Separately, Ford’s plans of transitioning to EVs have hardly been smooth. Ford’s Model E division, which sells electric vehicles, lost $1.3 billion at an operating level, compared to the traditional auto segments that earned a combined total of $3.9 billion. Ford has also pivoted its EV plans, moving away from larger vehicles and instead focusing on a smaller next-generation EV platform. These larger SUVs will now have hybrid powertrains instead. This led to Ford taking a non-cash charge to the tune of $400 million relating to the sunk costs. Catalysts For A Recovery However, we think there is an upside for Ford stock. One primary driver is the continued strong performance of its truck division, especially the flagship F-150 series. Sales of the F-Series trucks reached 199,463 vehicles in Q2 2024, marking a 30% sequential increase. Hybrid F-150 sales also saw a 38% year-over-year growth, with 33,674 units sold, reflecting consumer demand for a broader powertrain lineup. Trucks, with their higher margins, remain Ford’s most lucrative segment, and sustained strength here could support profitability in the coming quarters. Ford’s potential to boost its capital return program could also add further to shareholder value The company’s cash flows have been strong, with free cash flow generation for 2023 reaching approximately $6.8 billion, significantly surpassing initial projections. Ford has been paying dividends of about $0.15 per quarter, along with a special dividend of $0.18 in March. Given the robust cash flows, there is potential for additional special dividends. At present, Ford plans to distribute 40% to 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders. This year, the company has raised its adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, up from the initial outlook of $6 billion to $7 billion. Additionally, Ford’s pivot in its EV strategy, which now focuses on a balanced mix of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles could allow it to cash in on evolving consumer preferences without overspending on costly EV development. Slower industry-wide EV growth could also give Ford a chance to improve its profitability in the traditional segments as it invests in refining its electric vehicle offerings. Additionally, the market for hybrid vehicles is picking up, with Ford seeing its hybrid sales expand considerably, rising 56% year-over-year to a new quarterly record of 53,822 units in the U.S. for Q2. This should bode well for the company’s profitability in the interim. The recent monetary easing in the U.S. could also bode well for automakers like Ford. The Fed’s 50 basis point rate cut earlier this month marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move?

However, the landscape of India’s initial public offerings (IPOs) is beginning to reflect a troubling divergence from this age-old wisdom. A recent study by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) reveals that investors are increasingly driven by behavioural biases, with many choosing quick exits over long-term holds. The study analysed 144 IPOs listed between April 2021 and December 2023, uncovering a striking trend: 54% of IPO shares (by value) were sold within a week of listing, and 70% within a year. This behaviour runs counter to the typical design of IPOs, which are structured to showcase the long-term prospects of a stock. But as the data shows, the majority of investors seem to be chasing short-term gains. Read this | Swiggy IPO: How investors justify risky pre-listing trading For IPOs delivering strong listing gains, the trend is even more pronounced. IPOs that gained more than 20% within the first week saw 67.6% of their shares sold by value within seven days. In contrast, IPOs with negative returns saw only 23.3% of shares sold, highlighting the tendency to "lock in" profits early to avoid the fear of losing gains. The disposition effect: A costly behavioural biasAt the core of this behaviour is the 'Disposition Effect,' where investors are quick to sell winners while holding on to losers. Behavioural finance experts caution that this bias stems from emotional rather than rational decision-making, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. While the temptation to take quick profits is strong, investors risk missing out on significant long-term gains. This has been particularly true for several technology companies, where IPOs experienced short-term volatility but delivered substantial growth over time. By selling early, many investors forfeited the potential upside. "Cashing in on listing gains early may seem enticing, but IPO investors risk missing out on long-term wealth creation," explains Tarun Singh, founder and managing director of Highbrow Securities. Behavioural biases and market dynamicsBroader market dynamics have fuelled behavioural biases among investors. During the period in question, a surge in IPOs saw nearly 75% of offerings delivering positive returns, amplifying the Disposition Effect amid high optimism. Driven by the desire for quick profits and the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next big IPO, many investors sold shares with significant gains and reinvested in new offerings. Instead of offloading underperforming shares to generate liquidity, they prioritized selling high-gain stocks. Ans this | Why history tells us to beware the IPO frenzy Notably, nearly half of all demat accounts participating in IPOs during this time were opened post-pandemic, pointing to an influx of less experienced market participants. These investors are more vulnerable to behavioural biases like 'regret aversion' and 'herd mentality.' The comfort of locking in profits quickly, especially in a volatile market, can be tempting for such investors. Interestingly, the study revealed that 63% of retail IPO investors were concentrated in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, with 39% hailing from Gujarat alone. “The post-COVID era has seen a massive surge in retail trading, driven by a confluence of high liquidity and strong IPO returns. This has cultivated a quick-profit mentality among investors, where they are more focused on short-term gains than on assessing the true long-term potential of the companies, they're investing in," notes Prashanth Tapse, senior vice president of research at Mehta Equities Ltd. Policy interventions: Addressing the behavioural shiftEmotional investing, left unchecked, can contribute to market bubbles that eventually burst, as seen during the Dotcom Bubble in 2001 and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Recognizing the risks, the Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have introduced measures to curb speculative behaviour. Policy changes like the switch from a pro-rata basis to a lottery system for NII (Non-Institutional Investor) share allotments, and caps on IPO funding by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), are already making an impact.

Title: Microsoft HoloLens is officially dead — so buy one now while stocks last

Microsoft confirms no HoloLens devices will be supported after 2027 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has officially confirmed it will be halting production and sales of its HoloLens mixed reality headsets. In a statement to UploadVR, the company said it has ended production of the HoloLens 2 device, the latest model (albeit one released in 2019), with customers only now able to buy new devices while stock lasts. Microsoft HoloLens 2 will continue to receive "updates to address critical security issues and software regressions" until December 31 2027, the company noted. The news may come as little surprise, as Microsoft has not been focusing too much attention on HoloLens in recent years, as the company's focus drifts more towards AI, despite HoloLens 2 users finally getting a Windows 11 software update in April 2023. The original HoloLens headset, which will see software support end on December 10, 2024, was launched in 2016, with the company promising a new age of augmented and virtual reality experiences. However initial reception and sales were poor, as was the case for the HoloLens 2, partly due to its $3,500 price tag at launch, which placed it firmly in the range of enterprises only. This included specialist editions built for the US Department of Defense, with the US Army remaining committed to the wide-scale test of its HoloLens IVAS device in 2025. An initial order of 5,000 headsets, thought to be worth around $373 million, was signed off by Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Douglas Bush in September 2022 following successful field tests. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The company had apparently been considering plans for a HoloLens 3 device, but appeared to quietly drop this following layoffs and financial cutbacks that affected the project’s workers. The former head of the HoloLens division, Alex Kipman, also departed Microsoft in 2022 following misconduct allegations, with the likes of Meta and Apple making the headset space far more congested.

Title: Futures dip as Middle East tensions mount; jobs data on tap

By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended little changed on Wednesday, with technology shares gaining but investors nervous about Middle East tensions and more U.S. labor data due this week. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares rose 1.6%, helping to lift the S&P 500 technology index. However, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 3.5% after the electric carmaker reported third-quarter vehicle deliveries below estimates. Investors monitored Mideast news after Israel and the U.S. vowed to strike back following Iran's attack on Israel on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally." Data released early on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in September, further evidence that the labor market is not deteriorating. Investors remained focused on September non-farm payrolls data due on Friday, while U.S. jobless claims data is due Thursday. "We have the jobs report Friday, and then earnings season starts at the end of next week," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. "We're near all-time highs, and we know we have a friendly Fed out there. Before they push stocks to another round of new highs, investors want to hear some positive commentary from companies. People like that the Fed is very dovish and they are just waiting for another reason to push prices higher." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.55 points, or 0.09%, to 42,196.52. The S&P 500 gained 0.79 points, or 0.01%, at 5,709.54 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 14.76 points, or 0.08%, to 17,925.12. The market ended September with strong gains after the Federal Reserve kicked off its monetary policy easing cycle with an unusual 50-basis-point rate cut to shore up the jobs market. The S&P 500 is up 19.7% for the year so far. Odds of a quarter-percentage-point rate reduction at the Fed's November meeting are at 65.7%, up from 42.6% a week ago, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch Tool showed. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and other big banks will kick off S&P 500 third-quarter earnings season on Oct. 11. A strike by 45,000 dockworkers halting shipments at U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports entered its second day on Wednesday with no negotiations scheduled between the two sides, sources told Reuters. The dockworkers' strike is costing the economy roughly $5 billion per day, JPMorgan analysts estimated. Among declining shares, Nike (NYSE:NKE) dropped 6.8% after the athletic footwear and apparel maker withdrew its annual revenue forecast just as a new chief executive is set to take charge. Shares of Humana Inc (NYSE:HUM) fell 11.8% after the health insurer said it expected enrollment in its top-rated Medicare Advantage plans for those aged 65 and above to decrease for 2025. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 133 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.81 billion shares, compared with the 12.05 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WOONSOCKET, Rhode Island — CVS Health announced Tuesday it plans to lay off 2,900 employees, a move that comes about a year after the pharmacy chain laid off 5,000 workers. Mike DeAngelis, executive director of corporate communications, tells USA Today that the latest round of layoffs will be “primarily corporate roles.” Quartz reports the layoffs are part of the company’s effort to reduce $2 billion in costs. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” DeAngelis tells CNN. The most recent layoffs represent less than 1% of the company’s overall workforce, CNN reports.

An analyst tells CNN that drug store chains in the U.S. are struggling “because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs.” Competition from Amazon and chains such as Target, Walmart, Costco and dollar stores has cut into drug stores’ non-pharmaceutical sales, CNN reports. CVS reportedly has nearly 350 locations in Ohio, including dozens in Northeast Ohio. It has nearly 9,200 locations in the U.S. CVS has closed about 900 stores since 2022, CNN reports.

Title: Amazon’s RTO charge is just layoffs in disguise, experts say

Time Published: 2024-10-02T09:00:00Z

Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced last month, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, already has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them is that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Weight loss drug breakthroughs, gene therapies, and more: 8 clinical trials to watch right now
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-amgen-moderna-weight-loss-drug-trials-1851648407
Time Published: 2024-10-02T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
We’re only a few months a way from the end of the year, but pharma companies still have a steady stream of clinical trial results to announce before then. Several companies — including Novo Nordisk (NVO), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Amgen (AMGN) — are expecting to post the results of their next-gen weight loss drugs. Plus, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) is set to share preliminary findings from a trial testing CTX112, a genetically engineered cell therapy for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, Moderna (MRNA) may be on the verge of launching a new product beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. Check out all these and more must-watch clinical trials. 2 / 10 AbbVie (ABBV) bought Cerevel Therapeutics earlier this year for $9 billion. The deal included Cerevel’s “potential best-in-class, next-generation antipsychotic,” emraclidine. The experimental drug is now undergoing two six-week-long phase 2 trials to see how effective it is at alleviating symptoms of schizophrenia. Results are expected to be posted by the end of the year. AbbVie is competing with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), which is awaiting a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of its new schizophrenia treatment, KarXT, this fall. 3 / 10 Biogen (BIIB), traditionally focused on neurology, is intensifying its shift towards immunology. Soon, we’ll know how successful its efforts have been when they post results from a phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol, a potential new treatment for the autoimmune disorder lupus. 4 / 10 Moderna is still seeking its next major product as COVID-19 vaccine sales continue to dwindle. One promising opportunity is a vaccine for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common congenital infection — present at birth — with no existing vaccines. CMV can cause serious health problems in newborns and those with weakened immune systems. Moderna is expected to announce initial results of its late-stage trial of its CMV vaccine by the end of the year. 5 / 10 Neuroscience startup Neumora Therapeutics is developing navacaprant, a novel depression treatment that works by inhibiting kappa opioid receptors, which play a key role in regulating mood, pain, and stress. The company is expected to announce results from the first of three phase 3 trials testing navacaprant for depression in the fourth quarter of this year. 6 / 10 Novo Nordisk, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is developing a more potent obesity treatment called CagriSema. This new drug combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, with amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. Results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected this year. 7 / 10 Viking Therapeutics is set to present results of a phase1 trial testing higher doses of the oral version of its VK2735 weight loss drug at The Obesity Society’s Obesity Week in early November. Analysts at JP Morgan expect the company’s stock to jump following the presentation. A previous small clinical study found that patients taking a daily 40mg dose of Viking’s weight loss pill lost an average of up to 5.3% of their body weight in just 28 days. 8 / 10 Amgen is presenting results of a phase 2 trial of its experimental weight loss drug in late 2024. “The interim phase 2 analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with results that we’ve seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial,” Amgen CEO Robert Bradway told investors in May. Additionally, the company is already planning a larger phase 3 trial of the drug. An early-stage trial of MariTide found that users on the drug lost average of 14.5% of their weight in about 12 weeks. 9 / 10 CRISPR Therapeutics is using CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop genetically engineered cells, CTX112, that target CD19 — a protein that is used to diagnose cancerous white blood cells. Preliminary results from these trails are expected this year. 10 / 10

Title: What is Databricks?

By: John Miner | Updated: 2024-10-02 | Comments | Related: > Azure Databricks Databricks, Inc. is a data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark. The Platform as a Service (PaaS) has evolved over the years with support on Microsoft Azure and Amazon cloud-based platforms. Databricks purchased six companies to add features to its offerings, such as ML OPS, Data Governance, and Generative AI. As a new data engineer, how can I quickly get up to speed using the Databricks platform? At the core of Databricks' offering is the Apache Spark Engine. Initially, this engine was written in Object Oriented Java (Scala). However, the demands of big data have increased, requiring additional speed. Databricks added Photon to the Runtime engine. Photon is a new vectorized engine written in C++. The image below shows the traditional offerings from the Spark Ecosystem. These four areas will be covered at a summary level today. I suggest trying to use the Photon engine due to its speed. The image below is from the Databricks website. Just remember that this offer comes at an additional price. Check to see if you meet both your SLAs for data processing and monthly operating expenses (budget). Our manager has asked us to provide a high-level overview of the Databricks ecosystem to our senior management. The company has a large amount of data in an aging on-premises data center. The goal is to understand what is Databricks and associated ecosystem for business intelligence, data analytics and decision making. The above table outlines the topics that will be discussed in this tip. One nice feature about Databricks is that it can run on all three major cloud vendors (AWS, AZURE, GCP). Regardless of the technology, engineers refer to the data plane and control plane. The control plane is where coding and scheduling can be done. Most services depend on a cluster, the distributed computing power for Spark. See the architecture diagram below for details. Data engineering is just a fancy name for the extract, transform, and load (ETL) logic packaged in a workflow (job). The use of each step is up to the end user. I might extract (read - data source) from an Azure SQL database and load (write - data destination) to a parquet file using Spark Dataframes. Typically, when dealing with a data lake, one uses medallion zones. The quality of data improves as you go from left to right. The above image was taken from a Microsoft Technical Community article by Mike Carlo. There are two ways to work with files in Apache Spark: Let's start with two sample CSV files that contain weather data. The goal of this exercise is to read the high temperature and low temperature CSV files. Let's join the two dataframes and save them as a Parquet file. The above code loads the low temperate data into a dataframe named df1. The code below loads the high temperate data into a dataframe named df2. The code below writes the results of joining the two tables to a Parquet file. Any duplicate columns are deleted from the results. The syntax for the dataframes has a little learning curve. The PySpark code above was executed on a single node cluster. Without a cluster, no work gets done. The same ELT process can be coded using Spark SQL. The Spark language supports the following file formats: AVRO, CSV, DELTA, JSON, ORC, PARQUET, and TEXT. There is a shortcut syntax that infers the schema and loads the file as a table. The code below has a lot fewer steps and achieves the same results as using the dataframe syntax. The SELECT statement retrieves the first 5 records from the weather table located in the default database schema. There are two types of hive tables: managed and external tables. Regardless of table type, the DELTA file format is the only one that supports ACID transactions. Any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements executed by the end user against another file format will result in an error. The ACID properties of the DELTA format are achieved by using Parquet data files, Parquet check point files, and JSON transaction logs. To recap, data engineering within Databricks can be done in many ways. Things constantly change in technology. Databricks added the autoloader feature so that engineers did not have to keep track of new vs. old files. The delta live tables (DLT) is a declarative framework that simplifies data ingestion and allows for quality constraints. Both techniques are based on streaming and will be covered in a future tip. The warehouse is a relatively new addition to the Databricks ecosystem. The public preview of the service was released in November 2020. Please see the release notes for details. The SQL Warehouse computing power is measured differently than the Spark Clusters. Please see the documentation for details. With data engineering, you must pick the number of nodes, virtual machine series/size, access mode, and Databricks runtime engine and make any additional Spark configurations. Typically, the computing cluster is spun up with an optional auto-terminate value, which saves the client money by not having the virtual machines running 24 x 7. This computing cluster can be used for interactive tasks or job workflow execution. Most importantly, the computing cluster is carved out of the clients' cloud account. The computing power for the warehouse is measurable and is considered serverless in nature. No virtual machines ever show up in the client's cloud account. These clusters are owned by Databricks Service, are in a warm state, and are used for SQL workloads only. Please see the image below for an extra small cluster size named "Starter Warehouse." The SQL Warehouse environment is built around the schema explorer, the ability to run queries, create reports, add reports to dashboards, and define alerts based on queries. At this point, we are going to rebuild the weather table using the SQL Warehouse and Spark SQL. The code below creates a database (schema) named mssqltips with a comment. Comments are invaluable when a data governance tool is used to harvest predefined tagging. The design pattern below is important to understand. It will be used two times to create tables for both the low temperature and high temperature data files. First, if a managed table exists, we want to delete it. Second, we want to create an empty Delta Table with no schema. Third, we want to use the COPY INTO statement with the correct options. The file format and format options define the source file. Since we want to use the inferred schema from the file, we need to set the copy option to allow merging of schemas. The above code loads the low temperature data, while the code below loads the high temperature data. The last step is to create a view to join the two tables. Please note that the Spark SQL language allows for comments at the table level, view level, and the column level. The image below summarizes the options the developer has with the SQL warehouse: edit new queries, view saved queries, create dashboards from visuals, create alerts based on queries, view query history, and manage warehouses. In short, we can see we have two tables in the hive meta store. A simple SELECT statement of the view we created with a limit of five records is shown below. To recap, many of the data engineering features that you can do with Python can be done with the SQL Warehouse. I will cover the details of this service in a future tip. There are many ways a data engineer can stream data into a data lake. This section with introduce the simplest use case where CSV files are stored in an Azure Storage Container. We will be using our S&P 500 stock data in this example. The source data files are in a CSV format and the data processing is called structured streaming. The first task is to understand how many source files we have in the raw zone. This can be done by calling the list files method of the file system class in the dbutils library. There are six stock data files from 2013. We always want to use a schema file when dealing with weak file formats. Please see the Spark reference for SQL data types. This comes in handy when crafting a schema string. The maximum number of files that can be processed per triggered stream is set to two files. This number was picked to show you that three triggered events are needed to process six files. There are many options with Spark streaming. Other options include processing all available files in the source folder now and running the streaming process as a continuous event. The check below should always return true. The chances that the incoming stream is correctly formatted are low. We want the date column to be a timestamp that we can use in our Spark SQL queries. Additionally, information such as load time, path to input file, and various parts of the path might be important to the end user. The following code uses the withColumn to create new fields for our dataframe. The writeStream method appends the two CSV files loaded by the readStream method to a delta file. The checkpoint file is very important. This keeps track of files that have been processed. Thus, files will not be re-processed if they are listed in the checkpoint file. To rebuild a delta table, it is best to delete the "streaming" directory, which includes both the delta files and the checkpoint files. The writeStream action will stop once the readStream data is consumed. We can check the status of the write process using the code below. The last step is to stop the stream. This is a very important step that is sometimes overlooked. It is always important to check the results of executing a notebook. We expect two files to be loaded for every triggered event. The query below executes an aggregation directly against the delta file. The expected results show groups of records having the same load date. This section is a brief introduction to streaming. Future articles will talk about autoloader and delta live tables. These two features have changed how big data programmers ingest data. However, both methods are built upon the core Spark streaming concepts. The Graphframe project was introduced to the Spark ecosystem in the summer of 2016. It allows designers to supply vertices and edges as dataframes to the API. Then, interesting social networking questions can be asked. The image below shows a typical network of friends. The image below shows the two Spark Dataframes that are input to the Graphframe. Methods on the Graphframe object can be used to retrieve results from the graph. For instance, how many people are older than 33 or how many people have two or more followers? Please see the detail behind this section's content in a Databricks Engineering Team blog post. There is a knowledge graph use case that has been done with both Airline Flights, Insurance Policies and Life Sciences. Here, we only scratched the surface of what can be done with graph models. There are many different algorithms to retrieve information stored in their structure. A future article will be needed to dive deeper into the subject. Machine learning (ML) can be used to solve various problems, such as classification, regression, text analysis, image recognition, recommendations, and clustering. Here is a great cheat sheet on when to apply which algorithm (technique). The goal of this section is to understand what a data scientist can achieve by using Databricks. The first step in any ML project is to retrieve, clean, and prepare features. Because the data lake can store a variety of files, this is a prime location for the data scientist to explore what is available. The second step is to create a model. Many different algorithms and/or feature selections might be tried until a solution that has an acceptable prediction rate is achieved. The data for creating an algorithm is grouped into two sets. The training data set is used to create the model. The testing data set has a known set of outcomes. We use this set to judge the accuracy of our model. Databricks released ML Flow as an open-source framework in June 2018. Please see the release notes for details. Three key problems are solved by ML Flow: tracking, projects, and models. See the Databricks initial blog on the framework. Why is tracking important? The creation of models is like a lab experiment. Under certain conditions, predictive accuracy is achieved. Both the data and model might change over time. If our ML model drifts over time, the framework is a great place to find out why. The registry allows us to redeploy saved models that might achieve better results. Finally, we need to deploy our model to production. There are many ways to use the model like point-in-time scoring using web services or batch scoring over stored rows in a database. The framework can help with those problems, too. There are many ways to get data into a data lake. Both Spark Dataframes and Spark SQL can be used to ingest and transform your existing files stored in cloud storage. Traditionally, a medallion architecture is used to enhance the data quality as files are moved between the zones. I will talk about advanced data engineering services such as autoloader and delta live tables in the future. To compete in the Data Warehouse computing sector, Databricks created the SQL Warehouse service. The main difference between data engineering and this service is how a cluster is deployed. With traditional clusters, all the nitty gritty details must be configured. The computing power is carved out of the owner's subscription. The SQL Warehouse is considered serverless and T-shirt sizes are used to pick a configuration. The COPY INTO statement is key to getting data from files into DELTA tables. There is only support for the SQL language since this is a Data Warehouse. Other features that you might be interested in such as schedules, reports, dashboards and alerts in will be covered in a future article. The lambda architecture is based upon two lanes. The slow (batch) lane can be handled by the initial data engineering techniques that I covered. The fast (speed) lane is handled by streaming. Today, we covered how structured streaming can process files stored in a storage container. The read and write stream are important methods to learn. There are a couple techniques on how to handle transformations within micro batches. These topics will be covered in a future article. My first introduction to directed graphs was the Traveling Salesperson problem. The key idea behind this problem is there are customers in N cities and directed traveling routes. Starting at the home office, how can you visit all the clients? This problem can be optimized for travel distance, time traveling, and/or total cost. Unfortunately, the Graphframe library cannot solve this problem. However, it can solve other problems such as querying properties of the vertices and edges. It can solve the shortest path problem from one vertex to the next. Please see the documentation for more details. Machine learning has evolved over the years. What I learnt five years ago for my EDX Data Science certificate is totally different than what is available today. Regardless of the libraries and algorithms you are using, the data scientist needs a framework to track projects and models. The key purpose of a data lake is to have all the data in one place so that the data scientist can start feature selection. The clean-up of the data into an ingestible format is the lion share of the work. The selection and tuning of the ML model takes time and iterations. That is why tracking is so important. Finally, the model can be released to production. The work does not stop there. Periodic checking of the accuracy will notify you if the model has drifted and changes are required. This whole process is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops). In summary, today's tutorial is a high-level coverage of five different products that are part of the Databricks ecosystem. I hope you enjoyed the overview and look forward to going deeper into each topic in the future.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

October 01, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Oct. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Californiaâs Napa Valley wine industry is world-renowned, generating $50 billion annually in economic impact.1âEconomic impact,â Napa Valley Vintners, accessed September 20, 2024.The wines produced among the 700 wineries in the region rival those of any other region across the globe. The story of the Napa wine industry is a familiar one. Only a few decades ago, the region was a rural outpost with a small community of mostly independent vineyards. It boomed after investors and entrepreneurs worked together, put their product to the test, and won awards against the worldâs best in the 1970s. Napa is just one example of places and industries springing up from humble beginnings to become global successes. Dalton, Georgia, is considered a global carpet capital.2George Pendle, âDalton, GA: How a bedspread fiefdom became a carpet kingdom,â Atlas Obscura, July 7, 2015. Eighty-five percent of the carpets sold in the United States and 45 percent sold globally are made in the region. Similarly, High Point, North Carolina, is a global hub for furnitureâat one point the region was responsible for producing 60 percent of all furniture sold in the United States.3âFurniture history: High Point & furniture,â High Point Museum, accessed on September 25, 2024. Its biannual markets host exhibitors from around the world. Today, Napa wineries, Dalton carpet companies, and High Point furniture factories are a mix of big and small businesses, and in many cases still include family-run operations. They succeeded not only because of their product but also because of their ability to efficiently produce it at scale. The regionsâ success illustrates how, under the right conditions, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) in any industry can expand their global reach. Productivity is a measure of how efficiently goods and services, or output, are produced, compared with the amount of inputs used.1âInvesting in productivity growth,â McKinsey Global Institute, March 27, 2024. In macroeconomic terms, it is defined as the value of the goods and services produced, divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required for its production. For this report, we focus on labor productivity, measured as value added per worker (in US dollars at purchasing-power parity). While the more accurate measure of labor productivity is value added per hour workedâas the number of weekly hours worked varies substantially among US states. For example, the average weekly hours worked by production employees on manufacturing payrolls in the United States varied from 27.7 hours in Alaska to 44.3 hours in Louisiana in 2023.2âState and metro area employment, hours, & earnings,â US Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 2023. We use the per-worker metric, as it is more commonly available across size categories and sectors. Due to the lack of comprehensive data at the individual company level for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, we rely on subsector-level average productivity to make inferences.3We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational-productivity research often studies issues related to attrition, disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, âSome employees are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,â McKinsey Quarterly, September 11, 2023. To get there, US MSMEs should look to ramping up productivity, a move that will be vital to American competitiveness in the coming years (see sidebar âMeasuring productivityâ). Small businesses can reach the next level of growth by taking advantage of new technology, including generative AI (gen AI), and partnering with bigger companies, and they will need the infrastructure and systems to support them. The McKinsey Global Institute aggregated a richly granular data set of MSMEs and large companies across 12 broad sectors, 68 level-two subsectors, and more than 200 level-three subsectors in 16 countries with different income levels, accounting for more than 50 percent of global GDP. In this group (listed by per capita GDP in 2021 in purchasing-power-parity terms) are ten advanced economies (the United States, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Japan, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and six emerging economies. MSMEs play a large role across the boardâin the advanced economies, they average 66 percent of employment and 54 percent of value added. The United States has an ample small business engine. MSMEs, defined as businesses employing up to 500 people, are a major foundation of economic activity, responsible for 58 percent of jobs and 39 percent of value added in the business economy (Exhibit 1). In some US business sectors, MSMEs have an outsize impact. They account for more than three-fourths of workers and value added in the construction sector, for example. And they account for more than half of all workers and value added in the professional services and accommodation and food sectors (Exhibit 2). MSMEs also help fuel the US economic engine. Companies that were MSMEs at some point since 2000 now represent 17 percent of publicly traded companies valued at $10 billion or more as of 2023 (Exhibit 3). Small technology companies have made the biggest breakthroughsânearly a quarter of large public tech companies were MSMEs in the past 25 years, Meta and Zoom Video Communications among them. Many of todayâs big manufacturing companies also started as small factories. Monster Beverage and Tesla are recent examples. Innovation has been a big factor in fast-scaling companies. Small companies in the tech sector have produced more patents per employee than their bigger competitors.4Robert D. Atkinson, The National Economic Council gets it wrong on the role of big and small firms in U.S. innovation, Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, July 20, 2023. The United States enjoys a status as a global leader in business, with 621 of the 2,000 largest global publicly traded companies, according to Forbes, and is home to a disproportionately high number of very large, highly productive companies or superstars.5Hank Tucker, âInside the Global 2000: United States grows more dominant among worldâs largest companies,â Forbes, June 13, 2024; âSuperstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global economy,â McKinsey Global Institute, October 24, 2018. However, when it comes to small business productivity on a global scale, US MSMEs are comparatively average. US small businesses, in purchasing-power-parity terms, are roughly on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Among the ten advanced economies we studied, small companies are, on average, 60 percent as productive as big businessesâbut US small companies are just 47 percent as productive (Exhibit 4). Small business productivity varies by sector. While, on average, US MSMEs are on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy, they lag in a few sectorsâmining, transportation and storage, and administrative services. Additionally, they trail in some technology subsectors such as computer programming and some manufacturing subsectors such as basic metals, machinery and equipment, and furniture. The productivity ratio relative to large companies also varies by sector. In the United States, it ranges from 35 percent in mining to 88 percent in the administrative-services sector (Exhibit 5). In other words, MSMEs in the mining sector face the widest gap in productivity relative to their large peers in the same sector, closely followed by information and communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing. On the other end, MSMEs in administrative services come closest to performing as productively as their large peers. In fact, in a few sectorsâadministrative services, professional services, transportation and storage, and retail and wholesale tradeâmedium-size businesses with 50 to 499 employees perform at the same level or even better than large companies (with more than 500 employees). But, apart from accommodation and food, microenterprises with ten employees or less and small enterprises with ten to 49 employees are less productive than medium-size enterprises, which are on average twice as productive. Overall, the gap widens as the company size gets smaller. The vast productivity gap can be partially explained by differences in the kind of work undertaken by small and large businesses. Small businesses play a crucial role in enabling the productivity of large companies, which tend to focus on core competencies and outsource less essential activities to other businesses, a phenomenon called work fissuring.6David Weil, âUnderstanding the present and future of work in the fissured workplace context,â Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, 2019, Volume 5, Number 5. This results in greater concentration of higher-value-added activities in large companies, with smaller businesses taking on lower-value work. But ultimately, the productivity ratio depends on advantages of scale in areas such as technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies. For example, the share of MSMEs that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies.7The OECD model survey on ICT usage by businesses: Second revision, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015. Large companies are twice as likely to provide formal skilling programs and are more active in monitoring performance and awarding performance bonuses.8McKinsey Global Institute analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2013â22. MSMEs derive just 5 percent of their total sales from direct exports, which is one-third of the sales made overseas by large enterprises. The share of large businesses using banks for working capital financing is 1.5 times that of small businesses. Consequently, the MSME productivity ratio tends to be lower and the productivity gap wider in sectors where these competencies play a significant role in driving business competitiveness. MSMEs are ubiquitous across all states, but their economic contribution is uneven. On one end are states such as Nevada and South Carolina, where small businesses employ around half the workers and represent about 35 percent of receipts in the business economy. On the other end, in states such as Montana and Vermont, about three-fourths of employment is in small businesses, generating about 55 percent of those statesâ receipts (see sidebar âHow small businesses fared during the COVID-19 pandemicâ). Among the top 40 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) by employment, small businesses account for between 25 and 50 percent of receipts and between 50 and 70 percent of employment in the business sector (Exhibit 6). The number of new businesses registered each year in the United States increased dramatically during the pandemic. Over 2019 to 2021, the number of new businesses registered increased by 54 percent. However, while new businesses were registered, existing businesses closedâand their numbers appear to be in balance. The net number of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) increased by only 6 percent between 2019 and 2021 (exhibit). On the other hand, despite the number of new business registrations growing only by 10 percent in the prepandemic period from 2017 to 2019, the net number of MSMEs grew by 4 percent, and their employment also increased by 3 percent. A relatively higher number of MSMEs appear to have survived during this period. Despite the significant increase in new business registrations during the pandemic, these businesses did not generate proportionate employment, with the net workforce in MSMEs falling in half the states over 2019 to 2021. On average, the number of MSME workers fell by 1 percent in the United States. The proportion of workers employed by MSMEs stayed stagnant for the most part. This suggests that the industry structure might be gradually changing, with some small businesses growing into large companies, or more employees moving from smaller to larger companies, transitioning to more productive work. Overall, this is the right direction of movement for the United States. This variation in the economic contribution of MSMEs across states and MSAs is also reflected in their performance, measured as receipts per worker as a proxy for productivity. Some of these differences could be attributable to differences in price levels across states. Clearly, states with higher prices might generate higher receipts per worker than states with lower prices, independent of any true differences in performance. So to compare the true performance of MSMEs across regions, we measured the receipts that MSMEs generate for every worker in each state and in the top 40 MSAs by employment, adjusted for regional price parity.9Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise receipts per worker for each state and each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are adjusted to account for the differences in price levels of goods and services, using regional price parities (RPPs) sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. RPPs are calculated using expenditure data from the consumer price index, which is aggregated into broader expenditure categories and then allocated across regions using a multilateral aggregated method that expresses a regionâs price level relative to the United States. RPPs may not completely reflect the extent of price differentials within a state or MSA, particularly in areas with significant economic disparities. Across sectors, MSMEs are assumed to generate revenue locally within the state, while large companies are assumed to generate revenue globally, nationally, or regionally.10As a result, we adjust micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise (MSME) receipts per worker, depending on regional price parities in a state or metropolitan statistical area, but do not adjust large-company receipts. We adjust for all sectors equally. This approach has drawbacks in sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and information and communications technology, wherein a sizeable share of MSME revenue generation might be nonlocal. We estimate that this limitation could imply, approximately, a 15 percent variation around the mean. Similar limitations apply to large companies that might primarily generate receipts locally in certain sectors, such as a large restaurant chain only operating in a few states. MSME performance varies significantly across states (Exhibit 7) and MSAs (Exhibit 8). Their performance goes hand in hand with large-company performance. In general, where large companies perform better or poorer than the national average, so do MSMEs, and vice versa. MSME performance relative to large companies is concentrated within a narrow band. In more than 30 states with 70 percent of all MSME employees, small business receipts per worker are 45 to 55 percent that of large businesses. However, among the top 40 MSAs, there is a larger variation. The same relative performance band of 45 to 55 percent comprises only 15 MSAs, accounting for only 30 percent of employment. So why do MSMEs in some states and metros perform better than others? Reasons could include differences in the business environment and policies. Some states have tax, regulations, and compliance systems that support the expansion of large and small companies alike. Some states have more deeply ingrained business networks, greater availability of financing, and a concentration of talent, which provide a boost to MSMEs that struggle to access these competencies. Capturing the MSME productivity potential is vital for US competitiveness amid a changing world: geopolitical shifts, net-zero transitions and the rise of the green economy, and greater healthcare needs for an aging population, along with the developments in gen AI (see sidebar âHow generative AI can propel small businessesâ). There is already a tech adoption divide between large and small businesses. The share of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies. However, there is scope for democratization of tech access with recent AI developmentsâmuch of the new software targeted at small businesses is expected to have AI, and even generative AI (gen AI), embedded in them. Such gen-AI-enabled products and services can be used with natural-language prompts, rather than advanced IT skills. This democratization makes AI more accessible to small businesses, but also raises the cost of nonadoption. It can potentially create a divide between small businesses that embrace technology and those that donât. For example, if previously the difference between a business that adopted technology and one that didnât was creating email marketing campaigns versus printing marketing flyers, now the difference will be the tech-friendly MSMEâs ability to launch substantial digital marketing campaigns with a simple prompt, with the ability to analyze the effectiveness of the campaigns and tweak them easily. The productivity lift for such a company could be considerable. The effective use of data will rise in importanceâand small businesses can struggle with this, from both a scale and sophistication point of view. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often have a wealth of data, and gen AI tools can help them leverage that data to grow their business. So how can small businesses implement these technologies effectively? Here are several trends to consider: Although conditions vary across states and MSAs, the low productivity levels of small businesses are holding back US competitiveness. Narrowing the MSME productivity gap is equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDPÂ (Exhibit 9).11âA microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity,â McKinsey Global Institute, May 2, 2024. The tremendous variation in MSME productivity ratios across countries suggests there is ample room for improvement in many sectors in the United States. While meaningful benchmarks vary based on local conditions, we compare the average productivity ratio of MSMEs to that of large US companies with a top quartile ratio across the ten advanced economies we studied at a subsector level. Retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, construction, and ICT account for the bulk of the productivity opportunity by virtue of their large share of national output and employment. The largest opportunity is in wholesale and automotive tradeâwhich is almost 35 percent. In these sectors, MSMEs in the United States are only 38 percent as productive as large companies, a figure that is low relative to other advanced economies. For example, MSMEs in the automotive-trade sector in Japan are 62 percent as productive as large companies. They are more vertically integrated with large manufacturers, enabling efficient logistics that follow just-in-time principles and respond effectively to market fluctuations.12Christina L. Ahmadjian and Joanne E. Oxley, âVertical relationships, hostages, and supplier performance: Evidence from the Japanese automotive industry,â Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, 2013, Volume 29, Number 3.Â Similarly, wholesale trade MSMEs in Germany are 83 percent as productive as large companies. They benefit from market-leading innovation and vertical integration with upstream purchasers, such as retail supermarkets or distributors for large manufacturers, across the entire European Union.13Bernhard Dachs et al., EU wholesale trade: Analysis of the sector and value chains, The Vienna Institute for International Economics Studies research report, number 415, June 2016; Matthias Fauth, Benjamin Jung, and Wilhelm Kohler, âGerman firms in international trade: Evidence from recent microdata,â Journal of Economics and Statistics, 2023, Volume 243, Number 3â4. US businesses can take inspiration from these countries to improve their productivity. Moreover, US manufacturing supply chains are realigningÂ across the electronics, automotive, and pharma sectors, for example. The CHIPS and Science Act offers new spending and opportunity for MSMEs tied to semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.14âFact sheet: CHIPS and Science Act will lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,â The White House, August 9, 2022. In the electronics industry, MSMEs generate 22 percent of value added, accounting for 2 percent of the productivity opportunity. The automotive industry accounts for another 2 percent, which may improve the competitiveness of the American electric-vehicle industry. Additionally, the recent surge in biotech investments is another opportunity for MSMEs. They generate 18 percent of value added in the pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and biotechnology sectors, and their productivity opportunity accounts for 2 percent of the total. A competitive manufacturing economy requires efficient logistics, but in the United States, transportation companies are less efficient than their advanced-economy counterparts. MSMEs in the transportation sector account for 6 percent of the productivity opportunity. As the United States works to rebuild its public infrastructure and improve its supply of housing stock, as well as undertake capital expenditures in building renewable energy infrastructure, there will be an increased demand for construction services, a sector particularly dominated by MSMEs, with significant room for productivity improvement. Twelve percent of the productivity opportunity can come from small businesses involved in construction. The productivity imperative is even more important in the context of labor force shortages in the construction sector.15âHelp wanted: Charting the challenge of tight labor markets in advanced economies,â McKinsey Global Institute, June 26, 2024. Labor market tightness in the United States is among the highest across advanced economiesâmaking it challenging for the US economy to grow through employment alone. Almost three-fifths of job openings in March 2024 wereÂ in states with lower-than-average performance of MSMEs relative to large companies (Exhibit 10). Boosting MSME productivity could enable states to close that labor gap by offering workers higher pay and nonpay benefits, or by reducing hiring needs because they produce the same output with fewer workers. Either way, the small business gains. For small businesses, the road to higher productivity involves accessing four key competencies: technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies, explaining wider productivity gaps in sectors where they are vital for competitiveness. How can small businesses better develop these competencies? An answer lies in what may seem, at first, an unlikely source: networks and interactions with other, usually bigger, businesses. Business-to-business interactions fuel MSME productivity and help them narrow the productivity gap (Exhibit 11). Businesses large and small should reconsider whether they have an adversarial approach to one another. Policies that attempt to create incentives, quotas, or protections that tilt the balance toward either small enterprises or larger ones arenât necessarily the solution. The truthâbroadlyâis that both MSMEs and large companies can benefit when they are operating within the right economic conditions. Large companies could help smaller companies acquire competenciesâbut itâs not a one-way street. Small companies help large companies as customers, suppliers, and sources of new ideas. In fact, the productivity of large and small companies tends to move hand in hand in most sectors. Boosting interactions between them could raise overall productivity for everyone. Our analysis of a wide cross-section of subsectors across emerging and advanced economies suggests that MSME and large-company productivity move in tandem in most subsectors, indicating spillovers if the right conditions are established. In the United States and in other advanced economies, there are multiple examples of winâwin relationships between MSMEs and large businessesâtemplates for what has already worked. There are four kinds of models: larger companies innovating products and services targeted at helping small companies raise performance, intentional collaborative partnerships between small and large companies, more organically formed regional business clusters, and sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Serving small-business customers with offerings that boost productivity. MSMEs could interact with larger businesses as their customers. They could benefit from improving their overall efficiency and ability to invest in more technology and capabilities. Large companies can sell MSMEs productivity-boosting products and services and drive revenue growth. In short, small businesses could gain assets previously unavailable to them, and big companies could grow by selling those assets. Many small businesses have integrated with software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to automate back-end operations and build capabilities in areas like compliance, tax, and accounting, thereby eliminating the need for people to perform these tasks. For example, a large HR solutions provider created a chat-based app specifically for small businesses to handle payroll. Another provider supports small businesses in hiring and onboarding. Other such collaborations help small businesses outsource managerial tasks, saving time for the owners at a fraction of the cost of a full-time employee, including tools for writing business plans, cloud-based project management tools, calendar tools for tracking time and building itineraries, and virtual assistants that record conversations, transcribe interviews, and generate summaries. MSMEs have also collaborated with other companies to expand their market reach, by utilizing products that enable them to accept digital payments, create content for marketing, and run an effective ad campaign. MSMEs are also integrating with providers to manage their finances in real time, seamlessly connecting with banks, accountants, and other business applications. And larger companies are using these digital footprints, such as merchant point-of-sale transactions, to enhance small business credit scores, helping businesses that might not otherwise qualify for financing. Collaborative partnerships fostered through supply chains. Collaborations between large and small companies can generate mutual benefits. Partnerships help larger businesses by giving them added resilience and flexibilityâthey also help MSMEs by building know-how, human capital, and market access. For example, in advanced-manufacturing industries, which require inputs from multiple suppliers such as semiconductors, automotive, and wind turbines, close collaboration between large integrators and suppliers helps suppliers reach new markets. Some contractual partnerships between Toyota and its suppliers have lasted for more than 30 years. Toyota has directly involved itself in raising the operational standards of its partners through knowledge transfer, from demand planning and cost reduction to raising management capabilities.16StÃ©phane Heim, âCapability building and functions of SMEs in business groups: A case study of Toyotaâs supply chain,â International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 2013, Volume 13, Number 4. IBM, in collaboration with other Fortune 500 companies, launched the Supplier Connection initiative that connects small suppliers to one another and to large businesses to access new opportunities.17Freddie Pierce, âIBM launches new Supplier Connection portal,â Supply Chain Digital, May 17, 2020. One study of small businesses in New York found that seven in ten of them increased their revenue within two years of becoming part of a corporate supplier base.18Giving small firms the business, Center for an Urban Future, March 2011. Sharing technology is a big part of the benefit. In the consumer-packaged-goods industry, large companies have improved the efficiency of fragmented suppliers by providing advanced digital and analytics tools that smaller companies do not have. The Global Lighthouse Networkâa World Economic Forum initiative in collaboration with McKinseyâhas identified multiple companies that have achieved productivity improvements of up to 250 percent in some factories.19Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at speed and scale, World Economic Forum, December 2023. Some companies have focused on lifting the capabilities of the small business workforce through training programs that help them succeed as suppliers. One exampleÂ is Appleâs $50 million fund to provide learning and skills development opportunities for the employees of its suppliers, launched in collaboration with the International Labour Organization and the International Organization for Migration.20âApple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund,â Apple press release, March 30, 2022. Another is NestlÃ©âs Nescafe Plan, which has provided training to small coffee farmers on techniques to increase crop yields.21Mark Segal, âNestle commits over $1 billion to sustainable coffee farming plan,â ESG Today, October 4, 2022. Finally, small companies can gain financial access by working with bigger companies. Some large companies use their relationships with financial institutions to advocate for small suppliers who may otherwise be unable to access credit or who may receive unfavorable rates. In Colombia, DuPont used its relationship with a financial institution to secure working capital credit for its MSME suppliers in rural areas. This, in turn, strengthened their supply chain and stabilized procurement.22Partnerships for small enterprise development, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. Vibrant, organically formed business clusters of large and small companies. In some industries and areas, such as Silicon Valley or the furniture industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan, small and large companies have formed regional networks of people, ideas, and financing. Small companies gain from concentrations of capital and talent drawn to the area by universities and large companies. Large companies gain from the innovation and entrepreneurialism of smaller ones (for example, through acquisitions). In Sacramento, a different kind of cluster has developed. Like Silicon Valley, the Sacramento cluster boosts the areaâs natural advantages by connecting large businesses, start-ups, academic research, and private capital. But the Sacramento agtech cluster replaces silicon chips for wine grapes, synthetic proteins, and irrigation systems.23âIndustries: Agri-food techâ Greater Sacramento Economic Council, accessed on September 20, 2024. People add capabilities, too. Drawn by the University of California (UC), Davis, which has a strong agricultural science department, large companies conduct biotech research in the area; the concentration of research labs, educated labor force, and expertise gives small start-ups an advantage over similar-size competitors. One example is Scout, a vineyard management start-up founded by a tech executive and a professor at UC Davis.24Vince Vitale, âNapa-based AI for vineyards closes $3 million in funding,â Press Democrat, April 9, 2024. The Sacramento cluster also provides infrastructure and financial access to MSMEs. Foodtech and agtech start-ups have access to wet labs, lab space, and manufacturing spaces that are set aside specifically for agtech start-ups. AgStart, a nonprofit, provides lab equipment, a commercial-grade kitchen, and event centers and has incubated more than 20 start-ups. mall businesses have gained access to capital, either through acquisition by another company, venture capital involvement, or public sector grants earmarked for developing the area. Sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Collaboration among companies could be encouraged by enhancing digital data and financial infrastructure, establishing a training ecosystem and creating a level playing fieldâin turn, fueling productivity for small businesses. An open data framework, for instance, could enable financial institutions to use nontraditional data sources for credit underwriting, targeted at a range of underfinanced companies, including MSMEs. An Experian study showed that including utility data allowed 20 percent of âthin fileâ credit customersâthose with scant documentation to support their credit applicationsâto become âthick fileâ customers who have higher loan approval rates.25Let there be light: The impact of positive energy-utility reporting on consumers, Experian, November 24, 2014. A focus on boosting technical competence can enable growth among all companies, small and large. For example, while national labs are mandated to share research with companies, small companies seldom utilize these resources. Improving marketing efforts and providing incentives could encourage greater participation. Policy makers can play a role in promoting technology adoption. An example of this is Singaporeâs GoBusiness initiative, which provides financial support for all businesses that adopt technology solutions to improve their business processes, in line with industry road maps. Establishing a training ecosystem can help MSMEs access crucial technical and strategic expertise. Examples include the United Statesâ Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which provides small businesses with access to a national network of hundreds of specialists, who offer services ranging from supply chain management to industrial design, technology-driven market intelligence, marketing and sales, and more. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which administers MEP, estimated that the program interacted with more than 36,000 small manufacturers in 2023, helping to create or retain more than 100,000 jobs.26âMEP economic impacts boost business and jobs,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, April 1, 2024.Â For every dollar of federal investment, it also generated nearly $25 in new sales growth and $28 in new client investment, with a cumulative cost savings of nearly $3 billion.27âManufacturing Extension Partnership: About NIST MEP,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, updated February 9, 2024. Greater collaborations among MSMEs can also raise productivity through knowledge sharing, mentoring, networking, and collectively benefiting from investments. Business leaders and policy makers can join forces to create a pathway to greater MSME productivity. Small businesses can start the process by working with one another. There are three main considerations that could shape stakeholder actions: create a winâwin economic fabric, adopt a granular and tailored approach, and foster networks and connections. In many ways, what spurred the Napa wine industry to world-class status can happen across industries and regions in the United States. Just as Napa vintners shared resources and, in some cases, partnered with bigger wineries, industries as disparate as retail and construction can also use the tools afforded by existing, bigger players in their sectors. Pushing productivity among MSMEs is essential as the United States seeks to remain a global economic powerhouse. Indeed, many of todayâs great American companies have humble beginnings. Nurturing a new crop of small American businesses will keep the US economy vibrant, its workforce growing, and its status strong for seasons to come.

Karole Morgan-Prager, the Chief Legal and Administrative Officer at Blackline, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL), recently engaged in significant stock transactions, according to the latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On September 30, Morgan-Prager sold 10,000 shares of Blackline common stock at an average price of $55.00 per share, totaling $550,000. On the same day, Morgan-Prager also acquired 10,000 shares at a price of $14.00 per share, amounting to a total of $140,000. The transactions were carried out under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for buying and selling stock to avoid accusations of insider trading. This plan was adopted on March 8, 2024, and allows for trading to be carried out when the executive might otherwise be prevented from doing so due to insider trading laws or because of possession of non-public information. Following these transactions, Morgan-Prager now owns a total of 113,865 shares in Blackline, reflecting her continued investment in the company. Investors often monitor insider transactions as they can provide insights into how executives perceive the company's prospects. Blackline, headquartered in Woodland Hills, California, specializes in prepackaged software services and has been a key player in the industry. The stock options exercised by Morgan-Prager were part of a compensation package that vested in four equal annual installments, contingent upon her continued service with Blackline. The options were set to expire on October 16, 2026, but were exercised as part of the planned transactions. These latest filings provide investors with a snapshot of the trading activities of one of Blackline's top executives, offering a glimpse into the leadership's stake in the company's success. In other recent news, BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), a leading provider in the Financial Close market, reported a significant uptick in Q2 2024 earnings with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. This success was attributed to a robust quarter for the company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded BlackLine's stock from Equalweight to Overweight and increased the price target to $70.00, citing the company's promising margin expansion trajectory. Baird also maintained a positive outlook on BlackLine, reaffirming an Outperform rating and a price target of $65, while anticipating potential share price growth. In recent developments, David Henshall, an individual with a rich background in enterprise software and financial management, was appointed to BlackLine's Board of Directors. In terms of investment activity, Jana Partners established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake. The Saudi Public Investment Fund increased its U.S. stock holdings by adding call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Looking ahead, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. These are the recent developments in the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives. To complement the recent insider transactions at Blackline, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL), InvestingPro data offers additional context for investors. As of the latest quarter, Blackline's revenue stood at $624.4 million, with a notable growth rate of 11.94% over the last twelve months. This growth aligns with the company's position as a key player in the prepackaged software services industry. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Blackline operates with a moderate level of debt and maintains liquid assets that exceed short-term obligations. These factors suggest a stable financial position, which may provide reassurance to investors in light of the insider transactions. The company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 27.56, while its price-to-book ratio is 10.52, indicating that the stock is trading at relatively high valuation multiples. This valuation perspective adds depth to the understanding of Morgan-Prager's recent stock activities. It's worth noting that analysts predict Blackline will be profitable this year, which could be a factor in executive decision-making regarding stock holdings. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 10 additional tips for Blackline, providing a broader picture of the company's financial health and market position.

WATCH LIVE The job cuts at the company add to the 5,000 or so layoffs last year. LONDON -- CVS is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the company said Tuesday. "We've embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work," a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health's (CVS) workforce. "Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers," the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," the spokesperson said Tuesday. US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, "to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents," according to its latest annual report.

URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/meta-platforms-coo-sells-235k-in-company-stock-93CH-3644136
Time Published: 2024-10-01T22:39:55Z
Full Content:
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Chief Operating Officer Javier Olivan has sold a portion of his company stock, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transaction, which took place on September 27, 2024, involved the sale of 413 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $570.00 per share, totaling approximately $235,410. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which was adopted by Olivan on August 30, 2023. This type of plan allows corporate insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for buying and selling stock at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information, providing an affirmative defense against allegations of insider trading. Following the sale, the COO still holds a significant number of shares in the company. Directly, Olivan owns 12,359 shares of Meta Platforms. Additionally, indirect holdings through various entities bring his total stake in the company to a substantial amount. Specifically, Olivan D LLC holds 8,622 shares, Olivan Reinhold D LLC holds 2,999 shares, Reinhold D LLC holds another 8,622 shares, and the Olivan Reinhold Family Revocable Trust, of which Olivan and his spouse are Co-Trustees, holds 75,044 shares. The disclosed indirect holdings illustrate the various ways in which corporate executives can own stock, including through family trusts and limited liability companies. These disclosures provide transparency to investors and the market, offering insights into the financial interests that executives have in the companies they manage. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in social media and technology, offering a range of services in computer programming and data processing. The company's stock is watched closely by investors who are interested in the tech sector's performance and leadership trends. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has experienced a series of significant developments. Pivotal Research has given Meta a Buy rating, setting a new price target of $780. The firm has highlighted Meta's potential for robust revenue growth and cost efficiencies, particularly those gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. Similarly, Monness, Crespi, Hardt maintained a Buy rating on Meta, raising the stock's 12-month price target to $620, citing the company's AI and metaverse potential. On the regulatory front, Meta was fined €91 million by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. This fine contributes to Meta's total penalties of €2.5 billion under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Oppenheimer has also maintained its Outperform rating on Meta, following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Lastly, the company has been positively influenced by Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)'s forecast of higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue, sparking renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI) chips. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' stock performance and financial metrics provide additional context to COO Javier Olivan's recent stock sale. According to InvestingPro data, Meta's stock is trading near its 52-week high, with a price that is 98.87% of its highest point over the past year. This strong performance is reflected in the company's impressive 92.6% price total return over the last year. The company's financial health appears robust, with InvestingPro Tips highlighting that Meta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. This strong financial position may provide reassurance to investors regarding the company's stability, despite the insider sale. Meta's valuation metrics present an interesting picture. While the stock is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.24, it also has a relatively low P/E ratio of 28.7 compared to its near-term earnings growth. This suggests that while the stock may appear expensive by some measures, it could still be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company's profitability is noteworthy, with impressive gross profit margins of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "impressive gross profit margins." For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 16 additional tips for Meta Platforms, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market performance.

Title: Microsoft Discontinuing Mixed Reality HoloLens 2 Headset
URL: https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-discontinues-hololens-2-headset/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T22:07:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is planning to discontinue its mixed reality HoloLens 2 headsets, according to a report from UploadVR. Production on the HoloLens 2 is ending, and sales will cease when stock runs out. Security updates will be provided until December 31, 2027, but after that point, Microsoft plans to end software support for the HoloLens 2. Microsoft was one of the first companies to delve into mixed reality technology, and it introduced the original HoloLens in 2016, following up with the HoloLens 2 in 2019. The HoloLens headsets have always been expensive and Microsoft has targeted them to enterprise customers rather than the general public. At the current time, Microsoft does not appear to have plans for another HoloLens headset. There were rumors of a version three back in 2022, but work was reportedly canceled due to a lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges. Microsoft has also been downsizing its mixed reality team in 2023 and 2024. Microsoft does apparently plan to continue supporting its HoloLens IVAS, which stands for integrated visual augmentation system. It is an AR headset that Microsoft is creating for the U.S. Army, and it is set to be tested in early 2025 to determine its feasibility for full-scale production. As Microsoft has been winding down its work on the HoloLens, it has partnered with Meta to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming and its Office apps to the Quest headsets, and it is also working on Windows 11 integration with the Quest. Apple's Vision Pro headset has been marketed to both consumers and enterprise customers unlike the HoloLens, but it currently shares some of the same shortcomings, such as a high price tag. Apple is not yet ready to abandon mixed reality, and there is another version of the Vision Pro in the works. A second AR/VR headset could come as soon as 2025.

The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," the spokesperson said Tuesday. US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, "to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents," according to its latest annual report.

Title: Man Baffled When He Shows Up for Job Interview and the Interviewer Is an AI Avatar

Time Published: 2024-10-01T21:53:14Z

When being evaluated for a job, employment seeker and marketer Jack Ryan found himself being interviewed by an artificial intelligence-powered avatar — and was not exactly thrilled with the experience. Ryan told 404 Media that the avatar he interviewed with, which was developed by a Melbourne-based AI startup called Fairgo, was "a perfect demonstration of late-stage capitalism." "While Fairgo's intent is to provide a fair and equitable interview process," Ryan said, "I can't imagine AI, [large language models], and other tools are able to interpret the human emotion and facial reactions to provide an actual, well-rounded interview." In a clip posted to his LinkedIn last week, the Silicon Valley-based marketer and self-described disabled athlete was seen smirking as the red-haired female avatar asked him for his work experience and encouraged him to get creative. "I find it helps when candidates tell me a story in answering the questions," the avatar, which does not appear to have a name, said robotically. It's a perfect encapsulation of the kind of uncanniness many said the age of AI would usher in — except, of course, far more banal. On its website, the startup claims that candidates interviewed by Fairgo avatars "consistently love the interview experience" — but Ryan very much disagrees. "As a disabled individual who is reliant on remote work, I am already concerned about openly stating I am disabled in the forms that companies put at the end of their job applications," he explained to 404. "To add an AI component into this mix, I imagine, would have the opposite effect of [diversity, equity, and inclusion]." Fairgo's CEO Julian Bright insisted in his own interview with 404 that his company's AI is actually there to help reduce human bias. Furthermore, Bright maintained that Fairgo's AI is not at all involved in the candidate selection process and that it does not use any video or audio taken during the process to evaluate candidates. All the same, being interviewed by an AI avatar seems to have left a bad taste in Ryan's mouth. "As someone who has interviewed upwards of 50 candidates for prior roles, human connection and interaction is the single most important indicator of how a team will mesh and jive together," he said. "If an AI is running the early stage process, it eliminates potential candidates because of its algorithmic design." At the end of the day, using a service like Fairgo's "shows how executives and corporations are further trying to cut costs on the human side of business," Ryan said. "As someone who has seen these layoffs at numerous top tech companies that then go on to rehire 6-12-18 months later... it's laughable at best and terrifying at worst," he concluded. We can't say we didn't smirk along with Ryan — but that's only to keep ourselves from crying.

Title: A New Month, Another Bout of Stock Market Volatility

It was déja vu on Wall Street Tuesday as stocks slumped at the start of a new month for the third consecutive time, as market participants assessed the escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the possible fallout of U.S. port strikes. The S&P 500, which closed at a record high on Monday to wrap up a strong third quarter, fell 0.9% on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 1.5% lower. Markets were rattled on Tuesday by a massive U.S. dockworker strike that threatens to throw a wrench in domestic supply chains and disrupt economic activity. Dockworkers at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports handling more than 68% of U.S. imports walked off the job Tuesday morning after the expiration of their contract with an industry group representing global shipping companies. Stocks got another shock Tuesday afternoon when Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, which came soon after Israel launched an incursion in Lebanon and following the killing last week of a Hezbollah leader. The escalations by Israel and Iran sent oil prices soaring more than 5% amid concerns that a deeper conflict could stem the flow of crude out of the Middle East, a major global supplier. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) popped amid the tumult, jumping as much as 24%. Investors flocked to traditional safe havens like gold, which was up nearly 1% Tuesday afternoon, and Treasurys. Tuesday’s volatility resembled both September's and August's in certain ways. Early August’s selloff was sparked by worrisome jobs data and shifting global interest rates. Treasury yields and stocks declined this morning as markets digested data showing a continued hiring slowdown. September’s early rout was led by tech stocks after chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) posted good but not perfect earnings, leading some investors to pull back from richly valued tech stocks. Tech led markets lower on Tuesday, with Nvidia off nearly 4%, and Apple (AAPL) and the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) each down about 3%. Investors will be hoping Tuesday's slump is as short-lived as the last two. Stocks rebounded throughout both August and September to finish out each month at or near record highs.

Dockworkers strike at the entrance to a container terminal at the Port of Baltimore, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) Americans are on strike. Nearly 100,000 workers across the United States are walking off the job over contract negotiations with their employers, ranging from dockworkers to Boeing employees. The latest to join the picket line as of midnight on Tuesday are 45,0000 dockworkers from Maine to Texas. The union representing East and Gulf Coast dockworkers failed to reach a deal with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance. Specifically, the union wants stricter protections for its workers who they say are vulnerable to being replaced by automation and demanding a 77% wage increase over the next six years. And that doesn’t include 33,000 Boeing workers, primarily in its manufacturing sector, who are still on strike after they rejected the company’s “best and final offer” for a contract. The company has since implemented a hiring freeze, paused taking on new plane and part orders (with some exceptions) and furloughing white collar and desk-based employees. The two labor actions stem from similar complaints: wage increases, and protections for workers who could be replaced by automation or AI. Indeed, such talent (and retention) concerns are among the top concerns for manufacturers. About 50% of the top challenges faced by manufacturing companies are talent- and people-related, according to a survey by ABI research. But it’s not just an issue in the manufacturing industry. Last year, unions representing screenwriters and actors (SAG and WGA) also held strikes that paused Hollywood production over AI protections for artists.

Shot of a group of businesspeople having a meeting in a modern office A new report by Owl Labs shows that American employees are increasingly prioritizing “green-flag” bosses in their careers. Some, more so than healthcare benefits. Have you ever quit a job because of a bad boss? What about staying at a bad job because of a good boss? Managers have so much to do with our experience at work. From providing support in your current role to creating paths for career development, they are your main point of contact with company leadership. So employees (and job seekers) are taking a closer look at who their manager is, and how the boss can help be advocates for them. “A lot of it has to do with putting trust into someone else for their career,” says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs, “especially as a hybrid or remote worker.” Indeed, the potential for things to go south with a bad manager can be so daunting that Americans are prioritizing a good boss with “green flags”—things like support, advocacy and helpful feedback. According to Owl Labs, 92% of employees said that a supportive manager is the most important factor to their work, second only to compensation. This is up from last year, when 85% of surveyed employees said it was important to their work, behind compensation as well. “Generations now are really thinking about interviewing their boss [during the job process],” adds Weishaupt, “because if they’re going to be represented by this person within the company, they want to make sure they trust them.” News from the world of work Dell joined tech giant Amazon in ordering employees back to the office full-time on Thursday, though the order only applies to salespeople for now, according to Bloomberg. The hardware giant has been bridging employees back into the office throughout 2024, going so far as to say that those that do not make it into an office won’t be eligible for promotions. Needless to say, neither Amazon or Dell employees are reportedly happy. Lionsgate has offered U.S. employees buyouts, including severance and early retirement packages, as layoffs hit the entertainment industry, according to Deadline.

Title: Treasury Department, Hospitals Among Top Employers Offering A.I.-Related Jobs: Study

Big Tech is undoubtedly leading the pack when it comes to shepherding in the A.I. revolution. But they’re not the only ones hiring talent to help develop the technology—consulting firms, defense companies, health organizations and even government agencies are offering some of the highest numbers of A.I.-related jobs in the U.S., according to a new data study from the computing solutions firm Getac. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. It should come as no surprise that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), two of the most dominant tech companies developing A.I., rank at the top of the list with 1,335 and 1,232 A.I.-related jobs available, respectively. The figures were identified by Getac through scraping data across hiring platforms like LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Microsoft had around 228,000 full-time employees as of June, while Meta’s headcount totaled at more than 70,000 during the same time period. Microsoft has bet big on A.I. through multibillion-dollar partnerships with the likes of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is ramping up to spend even more on the new technology in the future. Its capital expenditures for the April-June quarter, which totaled at $19 billion and marked a 78 percent increase year-over-year, primarily went towards A.I. and cloud-related projects. Meta, which recently released its newest A.I. model Llama 3.2, has also widely adopted the new technology through features like an A.I. assistant that integrated across its platforms and into products like its smart glasses and VR headsets. Other additions on the list, however, are less expected. Coming in at number four was the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has 417 A.I.-related job postings and has begun incorporating the technology in recent years. The federal agency began using A.I.-powered fraud-detection tools in 2022 and was able to recover a total of $375 million in fraudulent payments in the fiscal year 2023 alone. The department, which has more than 100,000 employees currently, is additionally piloting or using A.I. in a variety of other cases that range from virtual assistant chatbots that can point taxpayers to the correct public websites to a model that could predict how long it will take items to be delivered to target facilities. Trailing behind the Treasury Department is Huntington Ingalls Industries, a defense contractor and military shipbuilding company currently hiring for 363 A.I.-related positions. The company expects its Mission Technologies division, which applies A.I. to build next generation smart defense and intelligence systems, to eventually produce more revenue than its long-dominant shipbuilding sector, CEO Chris Kastner told Defense One last year. Consulting companies, too, have embraced A.I. in rapid fashion. Deloitte, which ranked third on Getac's study with 461 listings, has partnered up with the likes of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon Web Services to help clients and enterprises use generative A.I. Accenture, which came in at number seven with 293 open A.I. jobs, last year pledged to invest more than $3 billion into its data and A.I. practice. Another major investor in the technology is the Georgia Institute of Technology—the only educational institution to make Getac's list with 338 A.I.-related job listings available. In addition to offering graduate programs in both A.I. and machine learning, the school earlier this year collaborated with Nvidia to launch the first A.I. supercomputer designed for student use. "By attracting and developing the best minds in A.I., we can ensure that Georgia Tech not only stays at the forefront of technological advancement, but also aligns its A.I. initiatives with the Institute’s core values of ethics, equity, and transparency," Skye Duckett, the university's vice president and chief human resources officer, told Observer in a statement. In the health field, the Mount Sinai Health System is the dominant player when it comes to applying A.I. with 355 roles open related to the new technology. In addition to using A.I. to detect breast cancer and interpret medical imaging data, Mount Sinai has created several in-house algorithms, "including predictive models to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration," said the hospital network in a statement to Observer. Besides utilizing A.I. for health care needs, Mount Sinai also expects the technology to revolutionize its software. "Just about every piece" of Mount Sinai software will incorporate A.I. over the next three to five years, said Bruce Darrow, the hospital network's interim chief digital and information officer, in a recent interview with Healthcare IT News. "It's just the way that technology is going," said Darrow, noting that the technology will be helpful across electronic health record systems, emails, presentation documents and video collaborations.

Title: GLP-1s like Ozempic are now more popular than insulin for treating diabetes
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-glp-1s-insulin-tirlliant-health-report-1851662409
Time Published: 2024-10-01T19:16:00Z
Full Content:
It took GLP-1 medications like Ozempic just seven years to surpass insulin as the the second most common treatment for type 2 diabetes, according to a new report by the market research and analytics firm Trilliant Health. GLP-1 drugs rose from the eighth most common drug regimen for type 2 diabetes in 2018, a year after Ozempic launched in the U.S., to the second most common in 2023, according to Trilliant’s 2024 Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report. Insulin fell to third place last year. Metformin, which regulates blood sugar levels by reducing how much glucose is released from the liver and helping the body to absorb more glucose from the bloodstream, remained on top over the past six years as the leading drug for type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 drugs, which work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have also recently become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. In 2023, Ozempic was Novo Nordisk’s best-selling drug, with sales reaching 31 billion Danish kroner ($14 billion). Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk (NVO) and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Mounjaro, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. And their influence is still growing. According to Trilliant’s report, GLP-1s could boost or bring down demand for other medical treatments like gastrointestinal (GI) medications and bariatric surgeries. In the year after patients start a GLP-1 treatment, the proportion of patients with a GI-related diagnosis increased by one percentage point to 11.3% and the proportion of patients taking a GI-related medication increased by 3.7 percentage points to 33%, according to Trilliant Health Trilliant also projected that if GLP-1 drugs replaced just 20% of bariatric surgeries providers could stand to lose up to $533.4 million in revenue. “As new therapies become available and emerging evidence is incorporated into clinical guidelines, it is likely that some highmargin surgical procedures will be replaced by less invasive interventions, or there will be a decline in downstream demand,” the report said.

Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker looking to compete with the biggest tech firms in the industry like Nvidia (NVDA), filed for an initial public offering (IPO) Monday, with the goal of listing on the Nasdaq under the "CBRS" stock ticker. The company, founded in 2016, has spent the last several years designing chips specifically for AI technology. In its prospectus filed Monday, Cerebras said it has worked to answer the question of how it would design chips if it were starting the design process from scratch. The company says that its design process has led it to create a chip substantially larger than those created by competitors, to avoid the complex process of connecting them and to provide greater on-chip memory and bandwidth. In its prospectus, Cerebras reported a $66.6 million net loss for the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in total revenue, compared with a wider $77.8 million net loss and $8.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2023, as it said associated costs rose substantially year-over-year with increased production. It listed its competition as chipmakers including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC), along with Big Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have begun designing and producing their own AI chips. Cerebras didn't disclose how many shares it intends to offer, or what its IPO price will be, but clearly the potential IPO was announced at a time when companies are looking to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm for the AI industry.

Crypto long positions endure cascading liquidations for the past 24 hours as Iran launches an air strike against Israel. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action. The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X shared at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a second wave of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours. As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass data. Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million. According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day. Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (ETH) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (SOL) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8. Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE) registered the worst performance, tumbling 6.2% and 7.3%, respectively, to $5.33 and $0.1063.

Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland highlighted that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023.

Title: Buy Costco and American Express stock as inflation cools, analyst says

Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Q3 earnings are starting to roll in. What companies’ earnings do you expect to move markets? SHELBY MCFADDIN (SM): I think, as usual, fortunately-unfortunately, the big market movers are going to continue to be those that benefit from AI because they are such a big part of the concentration at the top. So when we think about what there will be news about versus what’s gonna move the market, it’s going to be the former, where we’re looking at the Nvidias of the world, the Microsofts, everything like that. But I think some of the companies that could be making news, even if they don’t have as much influence over the broad market, are companies that face the worst of the worst during the hiking cycle. So that could be companies that are in the credit bureau — something like TransUnion (TRU), where they have gone through a sort of drought with credit card applications and mortgage applications coming down and they’re now starting to see sort of the light at the end of the tunnel. And they also benefit or are hoping to benefit from the sort of reinvigoration of ad spend and marketing spend from various companies in retail and beyond that are relying on some of those sorts of identity services that companies like TransUnion provide. AM: What other opportunities are you seeing? SM: Another opportunity, similarly in the consumer vein and in consumer financial, would be American Express (AXP). And that’s because they sort of already have this grip on the premium end of the customer. So they were already quite resilient when things were looking down in that payment space. And now, going into a lower-rate environment where credit conditions are a little bit softer, they can start to expand the base again — rather, not the base, but they have landed, they can expand again where they’re capturing millennial spend, a little bit of Gen Z spend, and not having to be as picky, as meticulous about who is on the books. They can go ahead and get more consumers in their ecosystem, and that’s a win for them. So they have been able to win in this period — one, from maintaining some of their customers and then also having higher rates in terms of their lending products. And then now, as rates will slowly come down — yes, those rates on lending will come down a bit — they can go ahead and increase the number of cardholders they have. AM: Another one of your picks is Costco. Can you tell me about that? SM: The great thing about Costco (COST) for consumers and shareholders is that they’ve just got such great management at the helm that they really do deliver to all the stakeholders. Consumers have actually been able to see prices come down really before the rate-cut discussion started happening. If we were tuning in on the quarterly calls, they would very excitedly discuss “Here are 10 products where we’ve cut prices” because management was genuinely excited to be able to get those back down. So they’re pretty much always pricing at cost — they’re trying to give you the best value they can. We would expect to see any pricing there move in accordance with, really, what they’re seeing in supply. I would expect with other places, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s less white label at certain retailers, you might see a little bit more stickiness; where there’s more premium, you might see something a little bit more sticky. When we think about the Kirkland brand, what they’re able to do at the cost that they’re able to do it is really just first in class. So I would expect that they continue to get rewarded for the fact that they are drawing in consumers looking for value. AM: Gotcha. So Costco might be a pick. SM: Absolutely. Is the valuation quite rich? A hundred percent. We are constantly asking ourselves as a team: What is this really worth, and is the market arriving at this particular price? But in terms of just the fundamentals and how well the business is run, it is something we are excited to own. AM: Awesome. Thanks so much, Shelby. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Smite Developer Hi-Rez Lays Off Employees, Focusing on Smite 2

Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:16:23Z

Hi-Rez has announced that they have made layoffs within the company as part of an "internal reorganization and prioritization." Smite 2 is already in Early Access but requires those who are interested in playing it to purchase the Founder's Pack first before the game goes free-to-play after the first year. Studio Head Steward Chisam made a lengthy post on X, saying that the changes that Hi-Rez have made are "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was first released in 2014, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has been ported to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and even Amazon Luna. The only place players can't play the game is on mobile. Smite has been a hugely successful game in the MOBA genre, with there being many characters to choose from and a big esports scene with multiple tournaments, which also includes the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship. Chisam hasn't disclosed how many were laid off in the restructuring and said that "this will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&A, and Titan Forge divisions." It's said that there will still be some developers working in small teams on Paladins and Smite to provide light updates to the games, but most of the studio is now shifting its focus entirely over to Smite 2. In the post, it's said that the team is now pivoting their focus on "gameplay development in the near term," which will include new modes, Gods, and quality-of-life improvements for the title rather than focusing on cosmetic and monetization features, which was originally the game plan for the Smite 2 team. Chisam has said that this has "a real human impact at a tough time," but also states that Smite 2's development team overall is larger than Smite's "throughout most of its life cycle. The team working on Gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the Smite 1 team ever was for such features. In this lengthy statement, it's also mentioned that they want to make Smite 2 the best possible game experience that can sustain itself "long into the 2030s." As the game is still in the Alpha stage, it's said that they have learned a lot about the process of "migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets players expectations and moves faster." Whether the amount of layoffs will be disclosed in the future is uncertain, and replies to the post have been turned off.

In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year.

Background of international currency notes. Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor—especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills. Heck, even if you’re not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold—you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio’s value and book an even bigger income stream going forward. But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn’t the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record. That’s the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK). Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today’s market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it’s all about what lies beneath those dividends. With that in mind, let’s stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with … ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that’s incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone’s talking about today: tech. The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you’ll find in just about any kitchen. As just those samples from the fund’s top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas. Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund 2Q2024 fact sheet This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market. And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too. Now let’s switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite: Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund June 30, 2024, fact sheet You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund’s top holdings read like a who’s who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are. When tech goes up, STK soars—but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK’s performance suffers. Then there’s the volatility. Don’t get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That’s not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts—especially when we look at the price you’ll pay for STK now. As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it’s worth. This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs—it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it’s harder for it to get a lot cheaper). In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you’re paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that’s already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn’t make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time. Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That’s impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that’s built to withstand the market’s ups and downs. ETG’s ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024’s outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector. This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that’s largely because it’s been riding the wave of tech’s explosive growth. While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends.

Title: Vaginal Tritrichomonas foetus infection in mice as an in vivo model for drug development against Trichomonas vaginalis

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium.

(B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g005 Bortezomib showed good in vitro and in vivo activity against T. foetus, yet it and the other proteasome inhibitors were markedly less potent against the different T. foetus strains than T. vaginalis (S1 Table). This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

Distance scale is shown on the bottom left. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g006 To confirm that the T. foetus proteasome is functionally similar to T. vaginalis, we analyzed the accumulation of ubiquitin-labeled proteins after proteasome inhibition by western blotting. For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g007 Development of new antimicrobial drugs depends heavily on the use of suitable animal models for in vivo efficacy testing [40]. Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE.

Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

Distance scale is shown on the bottom left. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g006 To confirm that the T. foetus proteasome is functionally similar to T. vaginalis, we analyzed the accumulation of ubiquitin-labeled proteins after proteasome inhibition by western blotting. For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

By Ej Dickson A few years ago, I was talking to the host of a popular Disney-theme-park podcast when the conversation invariably led to where it always does between two Disney adults: Why do we love Disney so much, when everything it does seems tailor-made to piss us off? This was in 2022, in the midst of a particularly brutal public-relations war sparked by the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ legislation prohibiting public schools from including materials about LGBTQ+ identities in their curricula. Many Disney employees were outraged by the bill, and because the company’s largest theme park is based in the state, there was massive internal pressure on then-CEO Bob Chapek to speak out against it. But Chapek did the opposite, explaining in a memo that publicly decrying Don’t Say Gay would “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and would only serve to “further divide and inflame.” Eventually, following days of bad press, Chapek issued a memo apologizing for not publicly opposing the bill. But the damage had already been done: Both progressives and conservatives were outraged, and the bad press eventually led to his ouster a few months later. According to reporting from The New York Times, Chapek would later tell people that he felt unfairly targeted, since his handling of the bill (or more accurately, its lack thereof) had been supported by the board as he went. Disney’s approach struck many, including myself, as the apogee of corporate bungling. It felt like the company was sending a clear message that although it would be happy to accept money from members of the LGBTQ+ community, that wasn’t tantamount to acknowledging its right to exist. And as a queer Disney fan myself, that message didn’t sit well with me. So I asked this podcast host: How did he square his own principles with loving Disney? Did he feel bad about it? He didn’t have to think twice about his answer. “Not really,” he said. “They keep putting out stuff I like. Yes, it’s a big, soulless corporation. And, yes, I still love it. Because they make things that move me.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 At the time, I thought this was kind of bullshit. There are a lot of brands that make things that move people. I, for one, am moved by fried-chicken sandwiches and carbonated water and $10 canvas sneakers. Yet I avoid buying Chick-fil-A or a SodaStream or Shein clothes, because there are aspects of their business practices that do not move me, that I, in fact, find repugnant. And while it may be momentarily satisfying to write a scathing Twitter thread calling out colonialist violence or evangelical Christian homophobia, voting with my wallet is by far my most effective form of protest. So why not do that, even if it means I can’t stream The Simpsons on Disney+, or purchase the new Pizza Planet-truck-inspired popcorn bucket? Is that really such a difficult tradeoff in order to affect some concrete, if marginal, change in the world? As it turns out, for me at least, the answer is yes. Because a few weeks — not even a few months — after the Don’t Say Gay debacle, I booked a trip to Disney World. I’ve gone on at least two more since then; in fact, I just came back from another one two weeks ago. I haven’t stopped buying my kids Disney-branded clothes and toys. I haven’t even canceled Disney+. The simple explanation for why I do this is because I am a hypocrite who is devoid of integrity. But I fear the actual explanation is far more complicated. I am one of a cadre of people who self-identify as Disney adults. While it would be easy to define this group as “adult Disney fans,” it’s a little bit like saying Beauty and the Beast is a movie about a hot girl who reads a lot and then develops Stockholm syndrome; it’s technically true, but it also kind of misses the point. Unlike Swifties or Trekkies or Philadelphia sports fans, Disney adults can’t really be defined by one or more demographic traits; you can’t say they skew white and female or middle-aged and nerdy or inebriated and prone to battery-throwing, because they are any and all of the above. They are united by only one factor: an unflagging belief that everything Disney puts out, from its streaming shows to its theme-park attractions to its cruises to its animated films, is superior to that of its competitors, in that it is infused with a specific ethos that can only be summarized as “Disney magic.” Disney magic is a term that’s even more difficult to define than Disney adult. On a customer-service level, it refers to the small touches that make a park guest’s stay more memorable: a free dessert here, an extra 30 seconds interacting with Chip and Dale there. It’s the type of attention to detail that is supposed to make you forget you’re spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, because Disney is not supposed to feel like a vacation at all. It’s supposed to feel like an enhanced version of reality, where the people are nicer, the streets are cleaner, and the food tastes (marginally) better. But there’s another aspect of Disney “magic” that’s more ineffable. It’s the way a full-grown adult man kind of has to catch his breath when he sees an actor playing Cinderella in full regalia. It’s the distinctly floral chlorine scent that wafts from the waters of Pirates of the Caribbean (so beloved that there are candles sold on Etsy inspired by the odor), or the way you automatically hear a clip-clop of hooves when “76 Trombones” pipes through the sound system of Main Street USA. It’s a feeling that marketing experts would likely chalk up to decades upon decades of a multinational conglomerate building brand allegiance across generations, but that a less cynical person would attribute to the apotheosis of the ideology popularized by Walt Disney himself, the idea that Disney will exist “as long as there is imagination left in the world.” Disney magic can be best summarized as a testament to the boundless human capacity for imagining, whether that applies to a child gazing up at Sleeping Beauty’s castle or an executive trying to figure out how to maximize quarterly Frozen-merch earnings. As a kid, I went to the Disney parks with my family probably every other year, because they were the one place where our conversations didn’t end in shouting and tears. I used to spend hours writing in my journal about vacations we took months ago, documenting every little detail like where we went to eat or about other families we’d met at the hotel. I would read and reread these entries, because they served as a reminder for me that there was a place where I could be happier than I was at home or at school, where all the kids thought I was a snaggle-toothed weirdo who read the dictionary for fun. (They were right, but that’s not germane.) So for me, Disney magic was the ability to envision a world where people were nicer than we were to one another, or than my family was to ourselves. Disney is, of course, not just its parks: It is an entire brand universe, comprising consumer products, publishing, media networks (ESPN, ABC, FX), studios (Pixar, LucasFilm, Marvel, 20th Century Studios), and international operations. It has such a stranglehold on the culture at large that according to one survey, Mickey Mouse has a higher level of name recognition than Santa Claus. Entire generations have grown up on a steady diet of Disney-owned properties, a list that has only expanded since the acquisitions of Marvel, LucasFilm, Pixar, and 20th Century Fox over the past two decades. One could theoretically spend an entire human life cycle exclusively consuming Disney products, from being swaddled in a Mickey-branded Huggies diaper to exchanging wedding vows in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. And while there’s no such thing as a Disney-branded birth or funeral, I would bet my 401(k) that the idea has been floated in boardrooms. For the past few years, however, there has been a distinct sense that Disney has been slipping in its ability to consistently provide consumers its trademark magic. Though 2023, the company’s centennial, was projected to be a banner year, its last animated feature, Wish, was a box-office flop, as was Pixar’s Elemental; its Marvel entries, The Marvels and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, fared little better. In May 2024, CEO Bob Iger revealed at an investor conference that Disney+, the company’s streaming service that launched in 2019, was operating at a $4 billion loss, largely due to what he deemed an emphasis on “volume and not quality,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Even the parks division, typically the most profitable of Disney’s verticals, is flailing, with operating profit declining three percent last quarter due to what CFO Hugh F. Johnston referred to as “moderation of consumer demand.” Share prices have plummeted. Over the past few months, I have spoken to various figures within Disney’s extensive orbit. Depending on who you speak to, the loss of Disney magic can be attributed to a wide range of factors: Many point to Bob Chapek, the parks head turned CEO who, by the end of his brief tenure, was so widely reviled that he was literally booed off the stage at the D23 fan expo. According to a September New York Times investigation, Chapek had essentially been pushed out by his predecessor Iger, who served as CEO for 16 years before retiring in 2021. A beloved figure within the company for years, Iger had become frustrated with Chapek’s poor management of Disney creatives, according to the Times piece, orchestrating his ouster even after he had personally hand-picked him as his successor. Others pointed to various external factors, such as the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the parks being temporarily shuttered, tens of thousands of employees being laid off, and a $4.7 billion loss in the third quarter of 2020. The economic instability brought about by the pandemic “was bad for every company, but especially Disney, because they count so much on the parks” for revenue, says Scott Gustin, a reporter who covers theme parks. “And I don’t think things have been steady [at the company] since.” Overall, however, there is a distinct sense among almost everyone I spoke with that over the course of the past few decades, via a series of decisions motivated by an amalgam of greed and complacency, Disney is in serious danger of losing its position as a cultural juggernaut. “Disney’s never hidden the fact they’re all about your money,” one former midlevel corporate employee told me. “But they’ve also provided high-value entertainment, high-value experiences. Now, I would say the company has pivoted to nickel-and-diming. And they are not providing high-quality entertainment and experiences in the same way.” (Disney did not respond to requests for interview or comment.) These conversations painted a portrait of a corporation on autopilot and operating under the assumption that it is simply too big to fail. These sources contend that while this may have been true for Disney at one point, the company has squandered enough goodwill among its consumers that it no longer is. “There is a sense that if the company is not careful and they don’t adjust their course, that there is a point where people won’t see them as the leader anymore,” says one former employee. They also were reflective of a company that is dismissive toward, if not outright contemptuous of, its most loyal fans. According to two former corporate employees, the company eschews hiring what one referred to as “superfans,” viewing a love for the brand as “a huge turnoff.” “To me, it feels counterintuitive, because I feel like you’d want to hire the people who know the brand best, so they can protect it,” the person said. “Some of your biggest advocates are going to be these people.” Fans of the parks in particular have expressed mounting frustration with rising ticket prices, the elimination of various amenities, and the perceived decrease in quality of the overall experience. Many of the sources I spoke to for this piece told me that in recent years, staffing had been an issue at the parks, leading to attractions being shut down, and overwhelmed employees providing poor customer service. Some issued complaints directly to the company, only for such feedback to fall on deaf ears. “They tolerate fans,” the former corporate employee told me. “They take their money. But I feel like the fans and the bloggers and the influencers kind of annoy them, too. From my perspective, they don’t market toward the people who are their biggest moneymakers.” In true Disney-adult form, many sources I spoke with skewed toward personifying these failures, viewing them as reflective not of a multibillion-dollar corporation subject to shifting markets and trends, but of an individual whose actions cause personal disappointment. One source I spoke with likened the company to a toxic ex-boyfriend who you always come back to against your better judgment; another person, to a high school mean girl. Now, they say, the brand is facing the consequences. “People are revolting against Disney,” one former executive said. “They are sick of the bully in the room.” TO BE FAIR, DISNEY HAS BEEN in similarly dire straits before. In the early 1980s, the company had lost its primacy in the film and animation markets, churning out forgettable features like The Fox and the Hound and Pete’s Dragon. Between 1982 and 1984, its net income fell by 25 percent, making itself vulnerable to takeover attempts by corporate raiders. With the appointment of Michael Eisner as CEO in 1984, Disney’s fortunes shifted, ushering in the so-called Golden Age of Disney animation with features like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin; drastically expanding the parks, including Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Paris; and acquiring ABC in 1995, including ESPN. Eisner also introduced the particularly brilliant marketing strategy of capitalizing on its existing intellectual property (IP) by selling limited-edition VHS tapes of classic Disney films, releasing them only for short periods of time. This strategy allowed millions of Gen X-ers and millennials to inject the iconography of Disneyana — the princesses, the castles, the songs, and, of course, the non-fucking mice — directly into their veins. In 2005, after a series of high-profile box-office flops and public feuds with former Disney animation exec Jeffrey Katzenberg, the board pressured Eisner to step down as CEO, leading him to hand the reins to then-President Bob Iger. As he documents in his book, The Ride of a Lifetime, Iger had inherited a company that was flailing as it had in 1984: The post-9/11 economic recession had sent Disney’s stock price tumbling, the animation department was adrift, and the advent of internet piracy had taken a bite of the company’s profits. “Almost every traditional media company, while trying to figure out its place in this changing world, was operating out of fear rather than courage,” Iger wrote, “stubbornly trying to build a bulwark to protect old models that couldn’t possibly survive the sea change underway.” In short, it was a climate very similar to that of our current media landscape, and Iger was able to clearly visualize a path forward for Disney that did not rely on traditional media frameworks. Foreseeing the impending demise of cable television, he became an early advocate for digital-first mobile-streaming content; he also led the acquisition of Pixar, which was by far outpacing Disney in terms of its creativity and ingenuity, thus successfully reinvigorating the animation team. Both of these decisions were widely derided and extremely expensive: “In essence,” Iger wrote of the launch of Disney+, the company’s streaming subscription service, “we were hastening the disruption of our own business, and the short-term losses were going to be significant.” But Iger was keenly aware of the fact that such short-term losses were essential to preserving the integrity of the brand and the quality of the product. “You have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there’s nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product,” he wrote. Under Iger’s leadership, Disney became a mega-conglomerate with massive global reach, with the company opening parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and building its extensive library of IP with the acquisition of Marvel, LucasFilm, and 20th Century Fox. And while this rapid growth has gone a long way in establishing the company’s dominance in the global market, it has also come with accompanying growing pains, particularly following the 20th Century Fox merger in 2019, according to a number of former corporate employees I spoke with. Once a legendary Golden Age film studio that produced such classic films as The Sound of Music, Star Wars, and Titanic, Disney’s acquisition essentially “swallowed up” the company and “spit out what it didn’t want,” according to one source. “That was a very dark point,” says the source. “It was ugly. It was ruthless.” The deal was accompanied by multiple rounds of layoffs, as well as a growing sense of complacency that made many employees’ lives difficult. One former employee sums up the attitude as follows: “You’re so lucky to work here, because you get to work on the best content, the best movies, the best shows in the world. If you are unhappy, we don’t need you.” To a degree, that attitude has always existed within the Disney brand. Yet those I spoke with said it was more justifiable prior to the merger, as well as the launch of Disney+ in 2019. That year, the company hit a high-water mark both creatively and commercially: Thanks to the release of box-office smashes like Frozen II, Toy Story 4, Avengers Endgame, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the company grossed a record $13 billion globally, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the worldwide box office. Something shifted, however. Multiple sources tell me that employees felt they were under so much pressure to ramp up output for the platform, and to establish it as a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon, that it became impossible to keep up. “There’s a pretty obvious decline in quality starting from 2019,” one former corporate executive tells me. “[2019’s] The Mandalorian is the only thing on Disney+ that was treated with the same care as they had treated [previous releases]. The pressure was just so intense to put out as much content as possible.” The end result has been a string of anemic superhero franchise entries (The Marvels), overhyped streaming series (the just-canceled The Acolyte), bloated franchise reboots (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), underperforming live-action remakes (Mulan, Pinocchio), and uninspired animated features, previously the bulwark of the Disney entertainment division (Onward, Strange World, Elemental). Though there have been a few hits over the past few years — 2021’s WandaVision was critically acclaimed, while Disney Animation Studios’ Encanto got a huge boost from its soundtrack going viral on social media — much of its output has been disappointing. And while some of these failures could be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with people failing to return to theaters in pre-2020 numbers, that explanation only goes so far. One source I spoke with speculated that the pandemic only served to highlight how little care Disney was giving to the quality of its entertainment offerings, operating on the assumption that people were bored at home and would watch anything put out under the Disney brand — an assumption that was proven wrong with the failure of what they viewed as subpar films like Soul and Luca. “Covid brought Disney to its knees,” one person told me. “And the problem is, Disney didn’t think it could be brought to its knees. So now it has to reckon with that.” On the parks side, previously Disney’s biggest revenue driver, the company has especially struggled. “There’s a lot of discourse around Disney’s rapid growth, and with that a lot of discourse about its perceived greed and the deep decline and quality of their movies and their parks,” says Jenny Nicholson, a YouTuber and former Disney cast member. In the spring of 2024, Nicholson posted a scathing four-hour video essay chronicling the downfall of one of the parks’ most notorious failures, Walt Disney World’s immersive Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which cost thousands of dollars a night and was open for barely 14 months before it shut down. Nicholson’s video essay condemning the project as an ill-conceived cash grab amassed more than 10 million views, seemingly due to its ability to tap into the mounting “frustrations” fans have with the parks, she says. These frustrations can be best summarized as the distinct feeling that guests are being cheated. Since the parks temporarily shut down in 2020, the company has slowly eliminated beloved amenities such as early park hours for resort guests, or free transportation from the airport to Disney hotels, or ways for fans to skip lines for free, all while steadily boosting ticket prices. “There seems to be a lot more push toward short-term profits as opposed to the overall longevity and reputation of the company,” says Nicholson. As a result of the skyrocketing prices, guests are increasingly shying away from the parks. On an August 2024 earnings call, CFO Hugh Johnston indicated that there had been a three percent decrease, or “a bit of a slowdown,” in operating income at the domestic parks during the third quarter. He added that the company anticipated a similar decline in earnings in future quarters, downplaying it as “a slight moderation in demand.” Such an admission must be particularly galling for the company in light of its arch rival, Universal Studios, building a massive theme park expansion called Epic Universe just a few miles away from Kissimmee, Florida, where Walt Disney World parks and resorts are located. One theme park journalist told me that over the past decade, Disney’s Imagineering division — the department focused on creating new theme-park rides and attractions — has focused too much on capitalizing on lucrative IP, such as the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, and less on creativity. “Where [consumers] sit, in 2024, we’re just after who’s innovating and who’s giving us thrills and spending money,” the journalist said. “And that’s Universal by far.” Disney’s overreliance on existing IP has been a source of frustration for fans for close to a decade — and if you look at the company’s slate of upcoming releases, it does not seem that they plan to pivot anytime soon. During the August 2024 call, Johnston noted that the downward trends in parks would likely be offset by the entertainment division, including the upcoming releases of highly anticipated films like the CGI-animated Lion King prequel Mufasa, and Moana 2. Citing those two examples is telling: Both are based on existing Disney IP, only emphasizing that the company has become overly reliant on adapting preexisting material, rather than generating new and fresh ideas. “Disney only has a few rabbits in their sleeve when it comes to bringing people to the movies,” one former employee told me. “There’s only so many animated films they can turn [into] live action. There’s only so many rides they can turn into films.” The quality, the former employee said, “is just not there anymore.” Ultimately, however, in speaking to various fans and insiders of all stripes, Disney’s decline can be boiled down to one crucial factor: arrogance. Having achieved market primacy for so long, and having garnered such a rabidly devoted and demographically wide-ranging fan base, there is an overwhelming sense that there is nothing Disney can possibly do to lose its hold over the public imagination. To adapt a famous 2016 election-era Trump boast, if Bob Iger stood in the middle of Main Street and shot Goofy in broad daylight, the company would probably lose some fans — but certainly not all. Its guiding ethos appears to be bolstered by the sense that it is simply too big to fail in any meaningful way. But if its recent string of failures are any indication, for one of the few times in the company’s history, it may not be right. ONCE, WHEN I WAS IN MY very early twenties, I was on a vacation with my family and we got into a fight. I can’t remember what it was about, but I was distraught enough that I needed to not be with them at the time. So I stalked off into the distance, sniffling and shaking and ignoring my phone calls, in search of someplace where I had always felt safe. And I ended up on the It’s a Small World ride. As my Friendship Boat gently rocked through the water, the intoxicating chlorine fragrance intermingling with that of the microwaved pizza from Pinocchio’s Village Haus next door, and animatronic kiwis and flying fish and can-can girls winking at me from the plasticine shores, it suddenly occurred to me how insane this all was. In a moment of emotional turmoil, I had not retreated into meditation or drugs or alcohol or cognitive behavioral therapy or any of the other tactics at my disposal. Instead, I’d beelined, as if by mammalian instinct, like a dying elephant making its way across the savannah, to a 1965 World’s Fair exhibition sponsored by Pepsi. Why had I done this? What was this going to offer me? How was this going to make me feel better? This wasn’t even an E-ticket attraction. There are about a million reasons I can think of to point out why It’s a Small World should not be emotionally effective. It’s long. It’s boring. It is built around a conception of global unity that does not celebrate cultural and political differences but completely eradicates them, as represented in the ride’s final tableau showing all the children of the world clad in the same generic white outfits, singing and holding hands, looking like a Benetton ad as conceived by the Hare Krishnas. Its primary designer, Mary Blair, was a genius whose artistic gifts were sublimated by the misogyny of the Disney company, resulting in a life of thwarted ambition that led to her early death from alcoholism-related dementia. And of course, there’s the song, two relentlessly peppy melodies played over the same set of chords, written by the songwriting duo the Sherman Brothers, who also wrote the music for The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins, and The Jungle Book. It’s frequently voted among the most annoying in history, even though it’s probably less so than Walt’s original proposal for the ride, which was to have all the children of the world sing the national anthem in their native tongues simultaneously. But no matter how many reasons I can come up with for why It’s a Small World should not move me, no matter how much I cringe when I think about sobbing on a boat ride surrounded by animatronic children, one fact remains: I am still moved. The idea that a group of disparate people from various backgrounds — a brilliant yet frustrated alcoholic, Russian Jewish immigrant brothers, a raging anti-communist and probable antisemite — could come together and present such a simple and united vision of children as a force for peace, is deeply moving to me. The idea that Walt Disney — a man who sold a vision of optimism and progressivism, yet was so contemptuous of his employees’ right to unionize that he voluntarily testified against them in the 1947 HUAC hearings, even firing the animator who created Goofy; the man who is perhaps most responsible for contempt for the little guy being integrated into Disney’s DNA — could set aside his own noxious politics to help present a vision of a better world for children is deeply moving to me. The reminder that we were all children once, that we all started out believing in a better world, undergirds so much of Disney’s best work. I’m thinking of the final scene in Mary Poppins, when the wealth-and-status-obsessed banker father finally presents his children with the kite they’d been begging him to mend; or the moment in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves when the orphan Snow White has narrowly escaped a violent death, and she’s scared and alone in the forest until she meets a bunch of woodland creatures and vows to stay resolute, the chirpy orchestral chorus for “With a Smile and a Song.” “There’s no use in grumbling when raindrops come tumbling/Remember you’re the one who can fill the world with sunshine,” she sings, as the bunnies wag their tails and the chipmunks scrunch their noses and the birds marvel at the beauty and the robustness of the human spirit. Every time I sing those words to my own kids — and I mean every time — I can’t help but tear up a little bit. Because it’s not a message of blind optimism or shiny, happy ignorance in the face of despair or anything else people like to accuse the Disney corporation of promoting — or which it has arguably promoted in its approach to things like the Don’t Say Gay legislation. It’s a message of power. You are the one who can fill the world with sunshine. You are the one who can use your own imagination to remake the world however you see fit. It’s a message I wish I had taken more to heart when I was an anxious, sad, scared little kid; I wish I had believed that I could have built my own magic. Frankly, had I done so, it probably would have saved my parents a lot of money. Over and over and over again, I continue to give Disney money, because Disney continues to make things that move me. I believe in Disney magic. I believe in the power of smart, creative people coming together to tell good stories in new and interesting ways, to teach us who we are and who we were and who we would like to be; and in the capacity to reinvent the world as long as there is imagination left in it.

Wall Street is heading for a lower open on the first day of October. The S&P 500 had a positive September for the first time in five years. September is historically the worst month of the year. With a 5.5% gain in the third quarter, the S&P 500 enters the seasonally bullish period into year-end up nearly 21% in 2024. 2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday the central bank is not on a preset easing course, signaling smaller rate moves going forward after September's 50-basis-point cut. The next big event that could influence the Fed and the stock market comes Friday when the government releases its September employment report. 3. Pivotal Research initiated Club stocks Meta Platforms and Alphabet with buy ratings and respective price targets of $780 per share (35% upside to Monday's close) and $215 (28% upside). The analysts see strong revenue growth ahead for Meta and a "deep moat" competitively at Alphabet. 4. Citi raised its Medtronic price target to $92 per share from $85, though analysts remained cautious. The best medtech alternative is Club name GE Healthcare, which has a newly FDA approved diagnostic agent and a tailwind from Fed rate cuts going for it. GEHC shares have been a top performer in our portfolio lately. 5. Stephens started Club name Danaher with an overweight buy rating and a $315-per-share price target, implying roughly 13% upside. The analysts see a pickup in biotech funding and Chinese economic stimulus as positives, putting the life sciences giant in a better position next year. 6. Barclays said Apple is seeing weak demand for its new AI-ready iPhone 16. Club members know that I am always skeptical of these so-called channel checks. I have said it over and over again, the expected robust upgrade does not have to happen all at once. 7. Citi upgraded Anheuser-Busch Inbev to buy from neutral. Is a large buyback coming? In beer, we own Modelo and Corona brewer Constellation Brands, which reports earnings before Thursday's opening bell. Constellation reset expectations last month and the market took it in stride. We want to see what's next. 8. KeyBanc raised its Netflix price target to $760 per share from $735. Who would have thought that of the FANG and "Magnificent Seven" stocks the video streaming giant would be the best? Meanwhile, Raymond James downgraded Club name Disney to a market perform hold rating. The analysts are concerned about the moderating parks business. 9. East Coast and Gulf Coast union port workers went on strike after a midnight labor contract deadline came and went. It was the first walkout by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977. Costco and Home Depot were among the Club names that were preparing for the work stoppage. 10. Wells Fargo cut its Boeing price target to $110 per share from $119 and kept its sell-equivalent rating on the aircraft maker. Boeing factory workers have been striking for nearly three weeks. Bloomberg reported that Boeing is thinking about a $10 billion equity raise.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the US health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s (CVS) workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Allurion reports average 12.5% weight loss in latest study

NATICK, Mass. - Allurion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ALUR), a medical technology company focused on obesity treatment, has published a systematic review and meta-analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of their Allurion Program. The analysis, which synthesized data from 11 observational studies involving 2,107 patients between 2016 and 2024, revealed an average weight reduction of 12.5% and a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) of 4.75 kg/m2 after four months of using the Allurion Balloon. Dr. Ram Chuttani, Chief Medical Officer and Founding Partner of Allurion, emphasized the importance of the findings, stating that the meta-analysis not only confirms the weight loss and BMI reduction outcomes but also highlights the metabolic health benefits associated with the program. These benefits include improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia levels. The Allurion Balloon, a key component of the Allurion Program, is a swallowable and procedure-less intragastric balloon designed to aid weight loss. It is complemented by the Allurion Virtual Care Suite, which includes a mobile app for consumers, insights for healthcare providers, and a connected scale. The program has been documented in 26 peer-reviewed journal articles and has been used by over 150,000 patients globally. While the Allurion Gastric Balloon is still considered an investigational device in the United States, the company reports a low rate of serious adverse events at just 0.90%. This data is based on the press release statement by Allurion Technologies and is intended to inform about the recent findings related to the Allurion Program. The full study can be accessed through a published article in a peer-reviewed journal. Investors and those following the medical technology sector may note that Allurion's approach to weight loss is part of a broader trend in the industry towards non-surgical and digitally supported therapies. However, as with all medical treatments, outcomes can vary, and regulatory approvals play a significant role in the availability and adoption of new technologies. In other recent news, Allurion Technologies reported a 25% increase in its second-quarter revenue to $11.8 million. Despite this, the company revised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance downward to $40 to $45 million due to regulatory and macroeconomic challenges. Roth/MKM recently initiated coverage on Allurion with a Buy rating, highlighting the potential U.S. approval of the company's weight-loss balloon. Chardan Capital Markets also maintained a Buy rating on Allurion's stock but reduced the price target to $2.50. Allurion has appointed Keith Johns to its Board of Directors, who brings extensive experience from the metabolic drug industry. The company reported safe and sustained weight loss in adolescents and patients using its Allurion Program, according to recent studies. However, Allurion faces a potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange due to non-compliance with the exchange's minimum share price requirement, but plans to address this issue within the allotted six-month cure period. These are some of the recent developments for Allurion Technologies. While Allurion Technologies' meta-analysis demonstrates promising results for its weight loss program, the company's financial health presents a more complex picture. According to InvestingPro data, Allurion's market capitalization stands at $39.45 million, reflecting its position as a smaller player in the medical technology sector. Despite the company's impressive gross profit margin of 76.19% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which aligns with the high-value nature of its innovative weight loss solutions, Allurion faces significant challenges. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company is "quickly burning through cash," which could be a concern for investors considering the capital-intensive nature of medical technology development and commercialization. Another InvestingPro Tip reveals that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year, with revenue growth showing a negative 23.59% in the last twelve months. This projection contrasts with the positive clinical outcomes reported in the meta-analysis, suggesting a potential gap between clinical success and market penetration. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Allurion Technologies, providing a more comprehensive view of the company's financial situation and market position. These insights could be particularly valuable for investors looking to understand the full picture beyond clinical data. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Sony has revealed that it already used machine learning in developing the 2023 game. By Hayley Williams on October 1, 2024 at 5:07AM PDT Sony's plans to augment its game-development process with AI and machine learning is already underway, the company revealed in its 2024 Company Report. In one example cited in the report, Sony used machine learning to augment the subtitling process for certain languages in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Sony has revealed it used voice-recognition software to automatically synchronize subtitles with their corresponding voice lines in certain languages, dramatically reducing the speed of the subtitling process. Spider-Man 2 launched with text support for 27 languages, with 12 of those also available in fully dubbed audio. The company said that this use of machine learning, a subset of AI computing, was part of a broader plan to "[deliver] our IP rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans." The segment of the report focuses on technologies that have the potential to improve efficiency in development processes, including AI and machine learning as well as real-time 3D processing, and sensing and capturing technology. Sony isn't the first to include AI in its development workflow, and it definitely won't be the last. EA has spoken on using AI in the development of this year's College Football 25 to automatically create models for the thousands of players who were included in the game. Microsoft is also all-in on AI, as is Amazon Games. Nintendo is one of the few major players in the industry to speak out against the use of AI in game development at this point. While so many companies are excited about the potential for AI in game development, few have touched on the potential impact it may have on the industry's human workforce, even as sweeping layoffs continue to impact developers and support staff across the industry. Video-game voice actors and mo-cap performers are currently on strike, with the use of AI a key concern for union SAG-AFTRA. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems—Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon—Across Corporate America Man lying on the floor. Accident in warehouse With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business’s most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers. While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms—like discrimination, bias, and fairness—are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers’ seat to first understand and address these harms. The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article—the first in a series on AI and the workplace—focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors. The Promise of Algorithmic Management Systems Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry’s claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber’s 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly. A Slippery Slope A slippery slope of mud and melting snow. Photo Tim Clayton (Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty ... [+] Images) However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like “cogs in a machine” or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion. As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006). Why This Should Matter to Investors Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon Skillful worker attending brief meeting in the factory . Industrial people and manufacturing labor ... [+] concept . Amazon—the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization—is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management. Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other’s claims that Amazon’s high injury rates are linked to the company’s workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon’s “Time Off Task” (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates. During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked “Amazon Confidential” that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021—nearly 25% of Amazon’s 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon’s announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour—Amazon’s largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits—may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay. Because it’s challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let’s also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety. According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon’s rate of recordable injuries—the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)—was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon’s total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company’s warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon’s total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries. Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled “2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,” which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June—ending the week of Prime Day—the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon Organization and transportation in the warehouse Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance. In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow. As a case in point, two warehouses violating California’s Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon’s largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an “excessively intrusive” surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees’ scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as “excessive.” As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs. Spreading Like a Virus Coronavirus Covid-19 Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity. Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable “work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,” among other issues. The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles—which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools—aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk.

Title: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Is This A Good Stock to Buy for Long Term?

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks. On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market. According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome. He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks. As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets. Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle. Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China. Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term. Our Methodology To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks. On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market. According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome. He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks. As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets. Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle. Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China. Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term. Our Methodology To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Itwas another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months—some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars. In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400. This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500’s 27% return. Much of the gains come from two people: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They’re two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits. Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer’s rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11. Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year. Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list: One of Sam Walton’s eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family’s third generation still sit on Walmart’s board: Jim’s son Steuart Walton (Lukas’ first cousin) and Rob’s son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman. “On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,” Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, “we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win.” His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023. Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump’s reelection bid. Griffin’s hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France. In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he’s backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024. In August, their Mars Inc. announced it’s gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg’s) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M’s and Kind bars. It’s the company’s biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations. Yass’ fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group—and Yass’ share of profits—based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna’s estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass). In August, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father’s 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA’s New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Rob Walton retired from Walmart’s board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings’ estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart’s “Every Day Low Price” strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family’s $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world’s wealthiest woman in early September from L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022. Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family’s charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell’s net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively. Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer—a phenomenon termed “Jensanity.” Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since. The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges. The Microsoft cofounder’s rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he’s set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple’s Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy. “Damn, I’m fired up!” exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers’ new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion. Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51 A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin’s Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet’s sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google’s continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months. More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America’s first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett—the nation’s greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving—donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed. It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm’s shares up 12% to record highs. He’s spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion–plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David’s media production company. No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He’s $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness. Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami’s “billionaire bunker” island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year. Tesla’s self-proclaimed “technoking” tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024. It’s a record-smashing year for America’s 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023. In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people—a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more—are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list’s total net worth. The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she’s worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year. As a group, the list’s women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built—rather than inherited—their fortune. Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare—just 25 out of the 400. Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane’s fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike’s Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir. Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career. These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation’s richest people. Among this year’s 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires. They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion). The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company’s David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101. The richest Americans’ net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people—2.5% of the list—have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5.

Title: Taylor Swift, Magic Johnson, Sam Altman: The American Billionaires Too Poor To Make The 2024 Forbes 400 List

There aren’t many things $1 billion won’t get you, but a spot on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans is one of them. Not even $3 billion will do it. This year, the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. are all worth at least $3.3 billion—a new record, and $400 million more than last year. That high bar means scores of America’s most prominent billionaires are simply not rich enough to make the cut. In fact, for the first time ever, there are more U.S. billionaires not on the list—415 and counting—than on it. These too-poor billionaires include celebrity moguls like Oprah Winfrey (estimated net worth: $3 billion), Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion), Magic Johnson ($1.2 billion) and Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion). Dozens of prominent tech and finance leaders don’t have enough scratch either, including virtual reality scion Palmer Luckey ($2.4 billion), Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), Bilt Rewards founder Ankur Jain ($1.2 billion) and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ($1 billion). Of course, there’s always next year. Just ask Jayshree Ullal, the president and CEO of Arista Networks, who was $100 million too poor in 2023 but, over the past 12 months, has ridden Arista’s skyrocketing stock price onto The Forbes 400 for the first time, with an estimated $4.4 billion net worth. And Altman may rank among the richest 400 Americans soon enough, too: According to multiple reports, OpenAI is currently discussing a restructuring that would change it from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation, and give Altman equity in the company for the first time. Bloomberg reported he may get a 7% stake in the newly restructured firm; Altman denied this to OpenAI staff last week, saying there are no plans for him to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. Though it may change soon, the CEO of OpenAI currently has no equity in the artificial intelligence giant he runs. Instead, he’s made a fortune through smart venture investments, including stakes in Stripe, Reddit and Helion, a research company looking to build the world’s first fusion power plant. OpenAI told investors that it’s expecting to soon close on a new funding round, which according to reports could value the firm at as much as $150 billion. The action star joined Forbes’ billionaires list earlier this year after our reporting revealed how he parlayed $500 million in Hollywood earnings into a diverse investment empire. His most valuable asset: a minority stake in one of the world’s biggest investment funds, Dimensional Fund Advisors. Seinfeld is the richest comedian in America thanks to lucrative syndication profits from his namesake TV show, including a five-year, $500 million deal with Netflix. Forbes named “The Boss” the latest entertainer to become a billionaire in July. His fortune comes from a lifetime of touring and selling records, as well as a $500 million deal to sell his music catalog in 2021. Jain is the founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards, a New York City-based credit card issuer that allows users to gain rewards – including airline and hotel points – off their rent payments. The company raised $200 million from private investors at a $3.1 billion valuation in January. The NBA superstar built his fortune off the court, including buying stakes in the Washington Commanders NFL team and Los Angeles Dodgers MLB team. His biggest asset, however, is a 60% stake in the $27 billion (assets under management) life insurance company Equitrust. A former door-to-door fax machine salesperson, Blakely made her fortune founding the shapewear brand Spanx. In August, she unveiled her latest invention: a stiletto-heeled sneeker called “Sneex.” The founder of online fashion retailer Fashion Nova – known for its social media and celebrity marketing – has spent $300 million over the past four years buying up Los Angeles real estate. In August, he paid $118 million for a new 175,000-square-foot headquarters for his fashion business. Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour and massively valuable music catalog propelled her into the three-comma club last October. Since then she’s released her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and continued her blockbuster Eras Tour. Kim K might be famous for being famous, but she is a billionaire from Skims, her shapewear brand that raised $270 million at a $4 billion valuation in 2023. She also has a skincare line, SKKN BY KIM, and a private equity firm, SKKY Partners. Crowned the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022 before falling from the ranks amid market turmoil, Wang regained the title in May after announcing that his artificial intelligence unicorn Scale AI had raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation. Wang owns an estimated 15% of the San Francisco-based firm. Ford sold his stake in his eponymous fashion brand to Estee Lauder in 2022 in a $2.8 billion deal. Since then, he’s put a big chunk of that fortune into an impressive real estate portfolio worth an estimated $200 million. The wunderkind sold his virtual reality company, Oculus VR, to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014, at age 21. His latest venture: Anduril Industries, a defense firm that was valued by private investors at $8.5 billion in 2022. Though best known for his music, Shawn Carter made much of his fortune in alcohol. He sold a 50% stake in his champagne empire Armand de Brignac to LVMH in 2021, then sold the majority of his cognac brand D’Usse to Barcardi in 2023.

Title: Five Stocks to Watch in October—and What to Watch For

The major indexes are trading near record highs after the Fed's rate cut fueled a rebound from a shaky start to September. Looking ahead at specific companies, October brings a major product launch from one of the Magnificent Seven and earnings reports from key companies in the tech, banking, and apparel industries. Below, we look at five stocks that could lead market trends—and see big price movements—in October. Tesla (TSLA) will kick off October with third-quarter delivery data early in the month. But investors may watch another event even more closely: a robotaxi launch scheduled for Oct. 10. The event, which CEO Elon Musk has said will be the most important moment for Tesla since it unveiled the Model 3 in 2016, will likely feature a prototype of the robotaxi model, dubbed “Cybercab.” It will also be an opportunity for the automaker to showcase its investments in artificial intelligence and its progress on full self-driving (FSD) software. Analysts have speculated that Tesla stock could get a lift if the company offers aggressive estimates of how quickly it can roll out robotaxis, the size of the market, or its timeline for achieving unsupervised FSD. Tesla stock has risen about 5% so far this year. Microsoft (MSFT) could set the tone for big tech earnings this quarter when it reports mid-month. While the company announced a date just yet, some market watchers expect that its earnings will drop after the bell on Oct. 22, the same day Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) is expected to report. Microsoft is one of four trillion-dollar tech companies—including Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—engaged in an expensive artificial intelligence arms race. Microsoft spent nearly $14 billion on property and equipment in the quarter ended June 30, a 55% increase from the same year-ago period. Much of that spending was on the chips, servers, and other equipment needed to run the company’s AI-powering data centers. Big Tech's spending spooked some corners of Wall Street, which fueled a string of dramatic tech sell-offs in July. Chatter about AI spending has since abated, but Microsoft and its big tech peers have, unlike the broader market, yet to fully rebound from their summer slump. (Still, Microsoft shares are up 14% this year.) Microsoft’s upcoming report has the potential to recast the spotlight on big tech’s spending or give Wall Street a taste of the payoff the company has assured them is coming. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest non-state-owned bank, could give investors a glimpse of what Fed rate cuts mean for American banks when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 11. JPMorgan shares tanked in early September after one executive warned that net interest income (NII), the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, was likely to be lower in 2025 than previously forecast. That warning came just days before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which it is expected to follow up with a string of cuts stretching into next year. Lower interest rates will weigh on JPMorgan’s NII, but they will also take some of the pressure off borrowers who otherwise might have defaulted on loans. Bank of America analysts think banks are better prepared to weather this rate-cutting cycle than any in recent memory. Plus, lower rates in the context of a soft landing—an outcome some economists say is looking increasingly likely—should spur loan demand, reinvigorate mortgage lending, and boost trading activity, all bonuses for banks. The analysts, though, conceded that it's easier to calculate how much rate cuts will reduce NII than how much they’ll boost revenue. JPMorgan’s quarterly results could shed some light on that trade-off and move the stock, which is up 24% since the start of the year. Nike (NKE) will report results for the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Oct. 1. and it will be the shoe retailer’s last report before incoming CEO Elliott Hill takes the reins on Oct. 14. The CEO transition marks the beginning of a new phase of Nike’s turnaround efforts. The company has been struggling for some time with sluggish sales in China, once considered its largest growth opportunity, and loss of market share to upstart rivals like On (ONON) and Deckers-owned (DECK) Hoka. Nike shares had their worst day on record after its most recent earnings report in June when the company forecast sales would decline by 10% in the fiscal first quarter. The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.

Amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that it’s spending more than it’s making, OpenAI is reportedly preparing to close a $6.5 billion funding round that could value the artificial intelligence startup at $150 billion. Thrive Capital is reported to be leading the round, and tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are reportedly involved in talks too. Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, The Wall Street Journal reported. As OpenAI looks for investors for its multi-billion dollar round, it is also talking to investors about restructuring its non-profit status to attract investors, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. And as it considers a for-profit structure, chief executive Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. During a meeting with Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, both leaders told employees that the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported. Here are the companies expected to invest in OpenAI’s $6.5 billion funding round. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital is reportedly leading OpenAI’s funding round and investing over $1 billion. Thrive has invested $750 million into the round, and plans to use a special purpose vehicle to add $450 million more from other investors, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Thrive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tiger Global, a venture capital firm, is reportedly investing an unclear amount of money into OpenAI. In 2021, Tiger purchased $125 million in shares of OpenAI, The Information reported. The firm was also part of a group of investors that pushed for Altman to be reinstated after he was fired from the startup in November. Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. United Arab Emirates-backed investment fund MGX is reportedly participating in the funding round. MGX, which was launched by the U.A.E. in March to invest in AI projects, hasn’t decided the size of its potential investment, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. G42, a state-backed AI company, and the U.A.E.’s wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, are founding partners of the investment fund. MGX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Khosla Ventures, which has previously invested in OpenAI, is expected to invest in the round through a special purpose vehicle, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Instead of using money from its venture funds, Khosla plans to raise money from limited partners, the people said. Khosla Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SoftBank (SFTBY) Vision Fund is investing $500 million in the funding round, The Information reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The investment would be the venture capital fund’s largest in a generative AI startup. In July, SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son blocked an investment into French AI startup Mistral to avoid issues with OpenAI, an unnamed person told The Information. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft, which has already invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, is reportedly in talks to participate in its latest funding round. Microsoft declined to comment. Nvidia, which designs the chips that power some of the world’s most powerful AI models, has discussed investing around $100 million in OpenAI, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Nvidia declined to comment.

On Tuesday, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) stock received a Buy rating from Pivotal Research, with a new price target set at $780. The research firm highlighted Meta's status as the leading social media company worldwide, citing its substantial daily active user base of 3.3 billion across its platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Reels, Stories, and Facebook Messenger. Pivotal Research commended Meta's management for its proven track record in developing new products and enhancements, particularly in response to competitors. The firm anticipates robust revenue growth for Meta, driven by increased usage, the introduction of new products, improved targeting, and higher pricing. This growth is expected to be further supported by cost efficiencies gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. The research firm's outlook for Meta is bolstered by what it considers an attractive valuation. Meta's earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 are valued at approximately 24 times, and when factoring out 90% of Reality Labs' losses, the valuation is closer to 19 times EPS. Pivotal Research expressed confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ability to steer Meta successfully in an ever-evolving world propelled by rapid advancements in AI. The endorsement from Pivotal Research underscores Meta's potential for increased profitability and market dominance. With its array of popular social media platforms and ongoing innovations, Meta appears well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI and the digital landscape. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has been a focal point of several analyst updates and regulatory news. Monness, Crespi, Hardt raised Meta's 12-month price target to $620, maintaining a Buy rating due to the company's AI and metaverse potential. Rosenblatt Securities also increased its price target for Meta to $811, citing strength in AI and VR/AR. Meanwhile, Meta was hit with a €91 million fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating on Meta following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Stifel reiterated a Buy rating on Meta, expressing confidence in the company's AI focus. These are among the recent developments in Meta's business landscape. As a reminder, this article reports on recent news and does not make any predictions or personal opinions. The information provided is based on past articles and is intended to offer a snapshot of recent events involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' strong market position, as highlighted by Pivotal Research, is further supported by recent financial data and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.45 trillion, reflecting its dominant status in the social media landscape. InvestingPro data reveals that Meta's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $149.78 billion, with a robust revenue growth of 24.28% over the same period. This aligns with Pivotal Research's expectations of strong revenue growth driven by increased usage and new product introductions. The company's financial health is underscored by two key InvestingPro Tips. Firstly, Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a strong financial position. Secondly, it boasts "impressive gross profit margins," with the latest data showing a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These factors contribute to Meta's ability to invest in innovation and AI advancements, as noted in the Pivotal Research analysis. Meta's valuation metrics also support the research firm's outlook. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) stands at 26.86, which, when considered alongside its growth prospects, suggests a potentially attractive valuation. This is further reinforced by an InvestingPro Tip stating that Meta is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips on Meta Platforms, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: How Meta’s Metaverse Bet Went From Awkward to Wow

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta’s Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma’s mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future — and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Technology Heidi Klum Brings Her New Game Modelverse to Roblox Wellness Oura's Sleekest and Most Efficient Health-tracking Ring Has Arrived Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban’s bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking — so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them — as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress — as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta’s Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype — which isn’t Meta’s first, but it’s the first to be showcased publicly — the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. “So with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence — like you were right there with another person,” Zuckerberg explained. “This is where we are going.” The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg’s “One more thing” moment, echoing Steve Jobs’ penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a “buy” rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. “We call this Hyperscape,” said Zuckerberg, “and the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.” He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham’s studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual Döppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot — perhaps a döppelbot — that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. “Meta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you’re going to,” said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language — Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta’s Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta’s Puma collaboration wasn’t part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta’s Web Platform Team teased “the future of e-commerce” through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset’s camera pass-through view. But it’s not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item’s color, and “experience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,” according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There’s a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset’s live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there’s nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. “A lot of the stuff we’ve been talking about for a long time … glasses, mixed reality, AI — it’s happening,” Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. “And you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it’s pretty awesome.” Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There’s no ship date or retail price announced yet — again, because it’s a prototype — but it will likely top the rival device’s $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it “impressive,” given that “most other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,” he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is “several years (and tens of billions) away from general release.” In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

Title: The Memo: To AI or no?

Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a “healthier” relationship with their work, compared to those who don’t use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who’s hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). “Knowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don’t,” HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. “It’s a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,” said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. “There are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,” he told Quartz. Read the full article here. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is creating technology likely to upend humans’ relationship with the written word. But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. “There’s all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don’t want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that’s important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,” Altman said on the “How I Write” podcast hosted by David Perell.

Time Published: 2024-09-30T19:45:36Z
Full Content:
Not only does Costco Wholesale (COST) do a good job of getting its 76 million members in the door—but, according to a new report, manages to keep them there, too. The average Costco visit lasted 37.3 minutes for U.S. customers in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Emarketer citing data from Placer.ai. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) (31.8 minutes) and Target (TGT) (28.7 minutes), according to the report. Costco is also the only one of the three to see its average "dwell time" for customers staying in-store increase from the first half of 2021 to the same period this year. One likely reason for the extended stays is that Costco frequently changes its layout, creating a "treasure hunt" experience for customers. The membership-based retailer isn’t alone in changing things up, but it is notorious for rotating its stock of items. In general, grocery stores are often known to stock essentials, like bread, milk, and eggs near the back of the store so customers have to walk all the way through to find them. Costco had 76 million members at the end of its most recent quarter, but starting Sept. 1 those members are paying more. After the retailer raised its membership price for the first time in seven years, executives said on an earnings call last week that they haven't seen any meaningful changes to renewal trends in the first month.

Full Content:
In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Netflix Cancellations Nearly Tripled After Chairman Reed Hastings Endorsed Kamala Harris

Netflix chairman Reed Hastings believes Kamala Harris will be good for America — even if his support for her may not be good for Netflix. Days after Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix and former co-CEO, endorsed Harris for president, Netflix had its most cancellations in a year, according to Antenna data. From July 25 through July 29, Netflix’s average daily cancels increased by 2.7x compared to the prior two weeks, the streaming-measurement company found. July 26 was Netflix’s biggest day for churn in the past year. After July 29, Netflix’s churn levels returned back to normal and have not elevated since. All told, July’s churn of 2.8 percent was elevated versus both June (1.8 percent) and August (2.0 percent). Related Stories Why the $17 Million Deal for ‘It’s What’s Inside’ May Be the Last of Its Kind ‘The Big Chill’ Meets ‘Freaky Friday’ by Way of ‘Black Mirror’ — Greg Jardin on ‘It’s What’s Inside’ Bloomberg first reported the news of the temporary churn uptick. Hastings’ support came via a post on X a bit after midnight on July 23. All Hastings tweeted was “Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win.” It didn’t take more than that for the cancellations to come pouring in. Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win Hastings did do more than tweet though. He later donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris’ run for president, the Republican Accountability PAC. Hastings said it is the most he’s ever donated to a single candidate. A spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to IndieWire’s request for comment on the Antenna findings. We suspect Netflix will be OK. As of June 30, 2024, Netflix had 277.65 million global paid subscribers. These days, the streamer is making nearly $10 billion in revenue each quarter — with more than $2 billion in profit — and its stock price is over $700 per share. Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) shares had fallen below $200 in 2022 after the company shocked the streaming world with back-to-back quarterly losses. Coincidentally, September 30 is the final day of the third quarter of 2024, which we colloquially refer to as the summer quarter. Netflix will announce the results from July-September on Thursday, October 17, 2024 at 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. Antenna plans to share its own September data on October 20, a spokesperson told IndieWire, give or take a few days. Hastings, who stepped down in January, will watch from afar as co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Sarandos’ own co-CEO Greg Peters, the company’s CFO Spence Neumann, and its VP of Finance, IR & Corporate Development Spencer Wang present the Q3 results to shareholders and the greater stock market. Netflix is far and away the most impactful streamer in the marketplace; Amazon’s Prime Video and the Disney Bundle are its only real competitors. Election Day is November 5.

Merritt Wever and Ethan Embry will also star in the David Michôd-directed movie from Black Bear Ben Foster, Merritt Wever, Katy O’Brian, Ethan Embry, Jess Gabor and Chad L. Coleman have joined Sydney Sweeney in the untitled feature about boxer Christy Martin from director David Michôd. The script for the movie was written by Mirrah Foulkes and Michôd. Production commenced Monday in North Carolina, Black Bear announced while revealing the full cast. The official description for the movie reads: “The film tells the unbelievable true story of formidable Christy Martin, who rose to fame as America’s most successful female boxer in the 1990s. A naturally gifted fighter, Christy’s life transformed in 1989 when she met her manager, and later husband, Jim Martin. Breaking boundaries, she became the first woman to sign with iconic promoter Don King, and the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Christy’s charisma, good looks and unwavering resilience in the ring won her a wide fan base and propelled her to become welterweight champion. Behind this well-honed public persona, Christy tackled personal demons, toxic relationships, and an attempt on her life, proving that a fighter’s hardest won victories aren’t always in the ring.” The untitled project is being produced by Kerry Kohansky-Roberts for Anonymous Content, David Michôd for Yoki, Inc., Justin Lothrop and Brent Stiefel for Votiv, Sweeney for Fifty-Fifty Films and Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, who is also fully financing.

By Melanie Goodfellow Senior International Film Correspondent Black Bear has unveiled a raft of cast additions to David Michôd’s untitled Sydney Sweeney-led biopic about boxing champion Christy Martin, as filming starts. The film tells the true story of Martin, who rose to fame as America’s most successful female boxer in the 1990s, at the same time as dealing with personal demons and toxic relationships behind the scenes. The new arrivals on the production include Emmy nominee and Independent Spirit Award winner Ben Foster (Hell or High Water), Emmy winner Merritt Wever (Nurse Jackie), 2024 breakout Katy O’Brian (Love Lies Bleeding, Twisters), Ethan Embry (Sweet Home Alabama), Jess Gabor (Shameless), and Chad L.

Production commenced today in North Carolina. Watch on Deadline A naturally gifted fighter, Christy’s life transformed in 1989 when she met her manager, and later husband, Jim Martin. Breaking boundaries, she became the first woman to sign with iconic promoter Don King, and the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Her charisma, good looks and unwavering resilience in the ring won her a wide fan base and propelled her to become welterweight champion. But behind the scenes, Martin was dealing with substance abuse, and a toxic relationship with her husband, who attacked her in their Florida home in 2010 and left her for dead on the bedroom floor. The untitled project is being produced by Kerry Kohansky-Roberts for Anonymous Content, Michôd for Yoki, Inc., Justin Lothrop and Brent Stiefel for Votiv, Sweeney for Fifty-Fifty Films and Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, which is also fully financing.

Title: TikTok's owner is reportedly developing an AI model with Huawei's chips

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

Title: New weight loss drugs could be developed much faster if Roche gets its way

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company’s website. These targets include the company’s recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 — a daily pill — and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.

The Non-Consumer Advocate by Katy on September 30, 2024 · 61 comments { 57 comments… read them below or add one } The last time we ordered Covid tests they never arrived. However, our insurance company allows us to get 8 tests per month from Walgreens or CVS. Hubby got his last week; as there are only two of us in the house I will wait and pick mine up down the line. Reply 90% of the time when I meet up with friends, we go for a walk in our neighborhood, or a hike at the adjoining nature preserve. A free workout + bonus friend time? Sign me up. I did three of those last week, and my steps are also looking great. ð 1) Used up absolutely ancient carrots in a crockpot chicken & dumplings recipe (one of my faves). I rinsed the carrots, and they smelled fine, so in they went. I’m the only soup eater in my house, so I made enough for a couple of meals, & froze the rest in single serving containers for easy lunches. 2) Sold some stuff on eBay & relisted a bike on FB Marketplace. I find bikes bring out the biggest negotiators, and I really dislike that part of selling, so I’m giving myself a huge pat on the back for getting this listed & dealing with all of the crazy shenanigans. 3) I really wanted a turkey sandwich on sourdough with sharp cheddar. Thought of stopping by a deli when I was out running errands. Instead, I bought everything I needed to make my own at the store. It was about the same for the ingredients as the sandwich, but so far, I’ve made three sandwiches & another grilled cheese for DS17. Cheaper would have been finding something to eat at home, but this was a good compromise. 4) We allow our home to be a study destination for DS17 & his friends, while they are all studying for their AP classes. They love the library, but it closes early some days. By studying at our house, they avoid having to buy something at a coffee shop or restaurant. 5) Continue to eat from our garden: tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, herbs. And, the pomegranates are almost ripe! Reply Not sure if this was frugal–last Monday we drove to southern Maryland to a produce auction. It was organized twenty-some years ago when the Old Order Mennonites decided to stop growing tobacco and switch to produce. Farmers drove their horse-drawn carts through a gap in the auction house. One paid by the item but had to buy the whole lot. Last year I got 32 long-necked pumpkins someplace else. We had eaten them all by mid-April. So I bid on a lot of 42 winter squash–and won. We schlepped them all home, and I weighed them as Bill brought them into the basement. They average 15 pounds compared to last year’s five and the lot included 46 rather than 42 squash. I have 682 pounds of delicious winter squash. It was time to call women I know who feed large families, hungry neighbors, or the homeless. I rehomed 15 of them yesterday and invited women to come back when they need more. I paid only 30 cents per pound at a time when winter squash run $2-3 per pound in stores. Other than that same old, same old–drinking water, cooking at home, reading library books, and meeting my fabric needs by helping sort donations for my guild’s yard sale. Reply Mary in MD, that’s a wonderful story about the squash! You’ve spread a circle of blessings far and wide. Reply Where is the auction? My daughter lives in Maryland. Is it a regular thing or just a one and done? Reply It’s the Loveville produce auction, slightly southeast of Leonardtown. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday through December. They have a website she can check out. Big lots and there is a small lot auction as well. I would have picked up cabbage, but the Prius was packed. Reply Thanks Reply Wow, I always wanted to go to one of those auctions, what a steal on the squash! Are they all the same or different? I have at least 200 squash (squashs?) from my garden this year – couldn’t believe how many grew, some are kind of weird (what IS that plant) but pretty, so may become decorations. Got 5 big cinderella type pumpkins and three lovely big white knobbly pumpkins, as well as a multitude of acorn, red kuri, baby pumpkin and medium pumpkin, delicata, plus a selection of dark green and light grey and blotchy and … names to be determined when I re-read the packages… I am now like the zucchini growers, looking for open car windows, LOL. How do you like to cook your squash? Recipes appreciated! * as for sharing your bounty with families you know, that is what the deal-finders do – let their friends know! Reply I think I have Boer, Musque de Provence, and New York cheese squash. I typed out my killer recipe for them last fall in these comments. Robin Robertson’s VEGAN ON THE CHEAP’s peanutty pumpkin stew. I bake them at 350 in halves if I can get them open, whole if I can’t. The ones with tan skin I chop in big chunks and bring to high in my pressure cooker, then turn off the burner. I use my immersion blender to puree them still in the cooker. Eating the skin isn’t a problem, but some people find green flecks off-putting. Reply 1. Used a package of gluten-free pizza dough mix to make two big batches of Italian herb flat bread. It came out quite nice. I cut it into single servings and froze it for my husband’s future meals. 2. My son accidentally bought a package of chicken sandwich meat he was never going to eat, so I chopped it up and used it with some last bits of frozen veggies, homegrown cherry tomatoes and rice to make a very tasty little casserole. 3. Rearranged our pantry to get some bulk purchased food from the clearance store off the floor. 4. Decluttered the pan shelf in the kitchen and found some items to donate, as I just do not bake desserts much any more. 5. The wind that came through from the hurricane tore loose a section of our bamboo fence, which I repaired with some bungee cords and filled in a spot where a bamboo cane shattered with straight sticks cut from some shrubbery. The giant catalpa leaves blown all over the yard got picked up and laid over some muddy areas to keep down the mud my dogs track into the house. Reply Glad you’re okay after the hurricane and only the fence needed bungee cords to hold it together. Don’t know what we’d do without bungee cords and duct tape! Reply Bungee cords are one of the most useful things. Right now one is holding my folded up clothes drying rack up off the floor so the puppy can’t chew on it and another is a divider in the metal mesh document holder on the side of the fridge. The uses are near endless! We need to replace the bamboo fence, but everything is so freaking expensive. Thst’s going to be a project to save up for. Reply Used up the last of the hello fresh discounted meals. Now making comprehensive shopping list We each get our $40 quarterly HABA allowance from United Healthcare so making a separate list for Walmart Sold 2 items via FB both happened to be dog show friends. Delivered 1 to a local dog show I happened to be going to. The other Iâll deliver at a show in the future Reply I really prefer going for a walk with a friend or just sitting on the front porch with a glass of wine rather than dinner out. My daughters, mother and sister have a girls night out once a week. I’ve said I wouldn’t mind if girls night became a bottle of wine with takeout and then help each other fix something or do a project around the house. Anyway here’s my FFT. 1. After many, many years of shopping for a new kitchen table and chairs I finally bought a set off of marketplace. It looks like it belongs in my kitchen and although it’s 25 years old it looks almost new. The only thing is I also had to take the china cabinet too. I don’t need another one and although it’s beautiful I’m not sure whether I’ll keep it. Right now I have the bottom half placed in my great room. I might sell it on marketplace or keep it in my basement for my next house. 2. I picked up a few ball jars on a free table while I was out of town. My daughter slammed on the brakes when she saw the free sign. That’s my kid. My other daughter took home a very cool vintage lamp. We are all very enthusiastic about free piles. 3. I finished a library book on my Kindle and started another. I’m most of the way through The Stone Girl by Dirk Wittenborn. It’s kind of dark but I can’t put it down. 4. My daughter is returning to her previous work schedule M-F which means I’ll be dog sitting for her a few days a week. Her husband stayed with my dog while we were out of town. I’ll also keep their dog while they are on their honeymoon. My oldest daughter and her husband will be gone for three weeks and my mom will keep their dog for them. It sounds crazy but it all works out. 5. I’m eating leftovers from an event I hosted at my house. All leftovers were divided and shared with whoever wanted them. I had several out of town guests that stayed with me which was a significant savings. Reply I’m also included in girls night…insert eye roll. Reply Some of my best time with my friends and family are when we go for walks in the neighborhood or do yard work. Maybe that makes me boring, but I’m ok with it. 1. Due to Hurricane Helene, which missed my area of Florida I was afforded a paid day off of work and some much needed down time. My son scored two days off school which he was able to make up some work. 2. I forced myself to look at sales adds and use Ibotta and some other apps when organizing my grocery list. The savings didn’t feel large, but I believe they add up. I can now cash out $23 in ibotta money. 3. I scanned my receipts into Fetch and Shopkick to also work toward giftcards in the future. I have stopped using Receipt Hog, a similar app, I scan but it doesn’t register the receipts. I tried! 4. I am considering going back to doing a sidegig delivery service. I signed up for Ubereats and realized I had to update my phone. I deleted over 2 gigs of data and updated only to find out that my model iphone will never udpate into ios 16 or higher which leaves me out of the Ubereats app…..back to the drawing board on weird sidegigs I can do to make more money. 5. I cooked from home for the last four days with us going for icecream twice. It felt nice to cook at home…..and a bit time consuming. But yay for eating what we already have at home and packing lunches. Reply 1. I too ordered free Covid tests and shared the news with my daughter and my sister. 2. The New York Times offered to upgrade my digital subscription to full access for the price I was paying ($1/week) for one year. Since this extended the time period I would pay that amount by several months I said yes. I noted the cancel date on my calendar. It is nice to have access to recipes and other things. 3. The grocery store had an offer to save $10 on groceries when you spend $50 on a certain gift card. I decided that was the cheapest way to obtain nutmeg. The nutmeg rang up for more than the shelf price so I received it for free. 4. I made a big pot of chili and used canned tomatoes that most needed to be used and low sodium beans I’d bought on clearance. 5. While we were in the Midwest we ate lunch at Culver’s and took the survey to receive free frozen custard. Reply Oh Culver’s! My fast-food weakness! Lucky I live in New England where there aren’t any or I would be there more than is healthy for me or my wallet. When we travel to an area that has Culver’s, we always make sure to pop in for something delicious. Reply Culver’s is quite prevalent in my area. Their food is well worth the price. I like it that they and another locally founded “fast” food restaurant will raise prices rather than skimp on quality. Reply I was gifted a prayer plant in 2003 and it’s still living, having been re-potted a few times. Interesting when the new leaves start to open. You can actually hear them if things are very quiet – scared me the first time it happened. LOL! Reply This is not frugal, but it makes my husband happy and that makes me happy: we bought an upright freezer with drawers that you pull out. So, now we have a drawer for meat, one for chicken and fish, another for…well, you get the point. His back has been hurting him and he would get so frustrated and in more pain trying to rummage around our chest freezer, so I would not ask him to get anything out of the chest freezer and things would get freezer burned. He is thrilled and, thus, so am I. It is our Christmas gift to each other because, really, we could have stumbled along the way we were. It is so wonderful to have things organized and easy to access. To compensate for this not frugal thing, I: 1. made myself list 10 items on eBay. Four have already sold! Turns out antique jewelry is a hot item. This alone paid for 75% of the freezer cost. 2. Took several bags of things to Good Will. Made sure to get a tax receipt. 3. Did 2 more post office mystery shops that were a longer drive from the house but were being paid with a bonus more than large enough. Another 3% of the freezer paid for. 4. Sent off a birthday gift with one of the post office shops, and a sold item with the other one. This saved me about $20, so more of the freezer paid off. 5. Took the chance and waited for an oil change mystery shop to have a bonus attached because no one wanted it. $160 paid for the oil change we get at the start of every winter, plus some cash. More of the freezer paid off. Only about $40 left to go and the freezer will not have taken anything out of our savings to pay for it. Reply Lindsey, the freezer sounds like an excellent use of your money. May you and your DH have less back pain and less freezer waste as a result. Reply The arthritis in my back was why I bought a small upright freezer to replace our little, very old chest freezer. The new freezer has fixed shelves, but I measured carefully and found baskets to fit at Dollar Tree that pull out so easily. Reply Your new freezer sounds wonderful and I’m sure your DH’s back will thank you both. I never saw one with pull-out drawers…how very convenient! Reply Lindsey, this made my heart sing. I love reading about the love you and your husband have for each other, the organized freezer you now have, and all of the ways you found to pay for it. Reply I’m so glad you got a new freezer that works for you and I like how you’re paying for it. That is awesome. Reply 1. Had some expired (with no extended dates) COVID test kits, so I opened them and recycled as many papers and boxes that I could before tossing the rest. Ugh, I hate waste. 2. Thanks to Heidi Louise’s tip, I ordered free COVID tests from our government. 3. Fed the exterior painting team chocolate cookies I received from a friend and Gatorade that I had received as part of a random take-all Buy Nothing post. I was planning to serve the painters lemonade and chocolate chip cookies, so the timing of the gifts worked out great. Now I can give those cookies and the lemonade to the landscape crew that will be here for three days. Among other things, they will be placing the 70+ boulders that came with our property within the new landscape and for rock walls needed for better drainage. The previous homeowner had the boulders in a pile in the backyard for years and never got around to using them. 4. Saved $1,200 in landscaping costs by moving rocks and plants ourselves and giving away other items on Buy Nothing. Not to mention free workouts! Also brought a carload of rocks to a dear neighbor and used the smaller-size rocks as fill where our driveway has washed out. Used part of the $1,200 savings to buy another tree and expand a planting area. 5. Attended an economist’s presentation at our financial advisor’s office and received a free lunch. Which is ironic since it was economist Milton Friedman who said, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Brought in papers for shredding as the office provides that service for free. Reply @MB in MN – technically your lunch was not free. Time is our most precious resource and you spent time. My micro econ teacher had a true/false test question “If lawyers didn’t charge fees, their services would be free”. False – you’d have to spend time due to the demand of the lawyer’s services. But I do consider free shredding a good deal. Disappointed my go-to local bank has no shred day planned for the rest of this year. A local non-profit offered shred services but I think that went by the wayside during Covid. I should call and ask. I don’t mind paying. Reply FFT, Freebies Galore Edition: (1) On my usual early a.m. stroll through the ‘hood, I came across several interesting finds. The first = two grocery bags full of books in the recycling containers of a nearby apartment complex. The bags were so full that I wasn’t able to get them out of the containers, let alone carry them home on foot. But I reached my “picking stick” into one bag and fished out one book–which turned out to be a nice paperback translation into English of Virgil’s epic The Aeneid?!? (As Mrs. Rachel Lynde says in one of the Anne of Green Gables books, “You’re never safe from being surprised till you’re dead.”) So I’m planning a predawn return tomorrow to this site with the Honda Element and will persuade the bags out of the containers by whatever means. (2) This one’s for you, texasilver: My next surprise came at the local Dollar General’s dumpster–which is usually kept locked, but which was unlocked and open this morning, with a heaping helping of clean, undamaged, and within-date foodstuffs (mostly cereals and crackers) on top. Fortunately, I had a clean backup bag with me, so I loaded it with a family-size box of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran, a box of Ritz crackers, and two boxes of Nature Valley “blueberry muffins” bars (new to me, and I look forward to trying them). And I’m going to take the Element around there tomorrow too, in the hope of scoring more stuff–although this may be chancier. (3) On the set of Depression-era brick steps connecting the main drag below us (where the Dollar General is) with our cul-de-sac at the top of the hill, I found not only more NY State deposit bottles and cans–which were what I was really looking for in my (1) and (2)–but a good solid steel made-in-USA pry bar. I scooped that up immediately, both on general principles and in case whoever left it on the steps was planning to use it for petty crime. (4) One of my later morning errands today was a stop at the pop-up thrift shop run out of a disused bowling alley on Monday mornings only by a local Catholic church, in aid of its food pantry. In addition to my purchases (two Chico’s tops, a pair each of Lane Bryant and Martha Stewart brand jeans, and four skeins of yarn for my next-door neighbor’s close friend, for a grand total of $10), I took a just-past-sell-by date package of Thomas’s English muffins from the free bin. (5) And I’m about to head over to the link provided by Katy for the free COVID tests. Thanks, Katy, and let’s all be prepared! Reply A. Marie, I just want to say that you seem like a very good and caring person and I always enjoy your comments here and on The Frugal Girl. Reply Seconded! I find myself wishing I could read A. Marieâs blog. Reply Holy Smokes!! I cannot believe the Dollar store bounty. We do not have one of those in Fairbanks, and I have never been to one when we go Outside, so when people talk about the great deals there I am envious. But to get them for free from their dumpster!! I do have a dumpster story. I once picked up my mail from the post office (there was no delivery to the cabin I was living in, back in the hills) and as I was leaving, I stopped at the open dumpster in the back of the post office to throw away junk mail. Just as I flung some in, I realized I had also thrown in a check for an article I had written. The dumpster was nearly empty so I could not possibly reach the check…I decided to climb in to retrieve it. As it turned out, I was a lot more athletic in my dreams than I was in reality. I could not get out. I finally had to shout for help and eventually this guy peered in and asked me if I was okay. I did not answer with sarcasm, as he was my knight in shining armor. He stood there a minute and said (and I will never forget this), “Miss, getting you out of there is going to be a two man job. I’ll be back.” I was in my 20s and as thin as I ever was going to be…He was good to his word, returning with a real bruiser of a guy who had been drinking. The post office was three doors from a bar, so he probably went in there and grabbed the nearest big man. They tried, heroically, to yank me out by my arms, to no avail. Finally the bigger one said, “I think I can push her ass up and if you can finish pulling her out.” It was very humiliating to have this guy help me put a foot up on the inside brace of the dumpster, and then he put his back against my rear and with a lot of groaning hoisted me up enough that the other guy and I, working together, could pull me out. I was filthy and there was a moment when we thought the inebriated fellow was going to have to be rescued, but eventually it was all over and I went home to wash my clothes. So, when I hear of you and others going into a dumpster, I know that not even bars of gold could tempt me back into one of those things. Reply Lindsey, just to clarify: I have climbed into a few dumpsters back in the days when I was young and agile, but not this time. I simply reached in with my picking stick and retrieved enough items to fill my clean bag that way. I no longer take witless chances. But that’s quite a ripping yarn about you and the check and the two rescuers (one sober and one not so much). Count me in among the many fans who think you should write an autobiography, in addition to the Adventures of Houndini and Clobber Paws. Reply Frugality inspires resourcefulness! Whatever method you need to employ to retrieve your foodstuffs is a good one. Reply What a great story! Reply I’ve done a lot of trash picking but never actually crawled into a dumpster. I was shocked a couple years ago when we were staying at the shore in a house with a bathtub. I decided a long soak with exfoliation would be a great vacation activity. When it was time to get out, I couldn’t. By the time the Mister got back, the water and I were both very cold. Reply That story made me laugh so hard!! I could see it in detail in my mind!! You really should write a blog or book Reply You made me smile A. Marie! You never know what treasure a Dol Gen dumpster will contain. Reply A. Marie, those giant size boxes of Raisin Bran sell for $6.99/box in my area (SW Ohio), so I’d say you got a great deal with the other things you snagged! Reply Thanks Katy and Heidi Louise for the tip about the Covid tests. Like A. Marie, I’m headed over to the site after I finish my FFTs to order some. 1. While out walking with DH, I saw something in a familiar shape in the dirt by the side of the road. Turned out to be a quarter, dirty and almost unrecognizable, but I brought it home, cleaned it up and into the found change jar it went. 2. I found a deposit can on another walk with DH. Only worth 5 cents in my state but I wouldn’t walk by a nickel laying on the ground, so I grabbed it. 3. Like Jill A and others here, I much prefer hosting guests at my house or going to others’ houses for get togethers. It’s not only for the savings but because we can sit around and eat, drink and talk until the cows come home and nobody cares. In a restaurant, there’s always the old side eye from the waitress or hostess who want to keep things moving. I understand in that business time is money which is why I prefer socializing in other ways. Walking is a great way to socialize and get steps in, I find. 4. Speaking of…we had a couple we’ve been friends with for years come over on Friday night for the above-mentioned way of entertaining. DH wanted pizza so we bit the bullet, ordered two and sat on the deck gabbing and talking for five hours! They brought beer and we had seltzer (store brand) on hand. Great time. 5. Reading a library book: The Witches Daughter by Orenda Fink. Great book if you like memoirs. Reply 1. I did another mystery shop with a *relatively* good payout of $22 to eat a hot dog and some fries, and it was in the neighborhood of several errands. 2. Almost stuck to my list at the grocery store, but I did purchase a $2.50 container of dolmas (for 10). I’ll have a couple for my lunch “on the road” and it will keep me from stopping somewhere. Like Katy, I also did used Fetch to get all of my 25 points, as I rarely get anything more due to lack of name brand purchases. 3. I stopped into the more expensive Stop & Shop to pick up 3 items from FlashFoods, which I notice now charge a 5% processing fee (lame). While there, I bought 1 loss leader and picked up a free jar of Chosen Mayo (who would pay $8.67 for a jar is beyond me, but I’ll happily pay $0.00). 4. I signed up for my free Covid and Flu shop. I hate getting shots (or anything with a needle) but this will means 20 points toward the 200 points that I have to “earn” to get 10% off my annual cost of health insurance. 5. I did a survey for Nielson’s of my media usage. It took less than 5 minutes and I got a $10 gift certificate of my choosing. Reply Loved your 5 FFTs. It’s the small and medium savings that can really add up. And I agree…$8.67 for a jar of mayo sounds like highway robbery. Reply While I consider mayo on the bottom of the food pyramid, I really can’t believe $8.67 a jar is far superior to anything else on the market. We did try Duke’s, not bad but I would not put it above anything other mayo I’ve consumed. Reply It is highway robbery. But I have an allergy to soy, so I’m stuck spending that on the prepared stuff. It’s not worth it for me to make it up fresh, because I wouldn’t trust the raw egg sitting in the fridge. But it makes me careful with using it. Reply 1. I made a hashbrown casserole, using up some eggs and cream that needed to be used. Now I have several breakfasts ready in the freezer for when I need something quick. 2. I cancelled my Walmart+ subscription. I had tried it for a month, and I did use it enough in September to make the cost worthwhile, but I don’t want to keep paying for it long term. 3. I bought only items that were on sale at Kroger. I was pretty pleased with some of the deals I got, especially a $0.39 chocolate bar from a fancy brand that normally would be out of my price range. 4. Same old, same old otherwise. Reply 1. I also ordered the free Covid tests and they are en route to us now. Our library also had free tests, so I was able to get one more box there. 2. Had a free trial week of Paramount and when I clicked cancel on the last day, they offered me a free month. I watched Mayor of Kingstown and Yellowjackets, but there’s not a lot I’m tempted by. 3. Attended the fall rummage sale at a local church. I think it’s one of the few places left that still has items priced at a nickel and a dime. I found a few things for myself, and a bunch of good stuff to resell, including a vintage leather Coach purse for $3, and brand new LL Bean boots for $2. 4. I had a poor experience at Kroger, and sent an email when I got home. They apologized and gave me a $15 store credit. 5. Not a frugal win for me, but I created one for someone else. I found a wallet in the street on my morning walk. I tracked down the owner online and they picked it up later that day, and sincerely thanked me. Reply That’s how you and I differ, as I love all the StarTrek series! Reply Thanks for letting me know about the Covid tests. I just ordered more. 1. We were supposed to have a yard sale Saturday and Sunday but it rained all day Saturday so we moved it to Sunday and Monday. My daughter and FIL both set up tables too. My son had to work but gave me a few things to sell. Between all of us we made over $700. The truck is full of leftovers and we are dropping it off tomorrow morning at our church thrift store. 2. I cooked in the crockpot both days to avoid takeout. 3. We gave several items to our neighbor that she was interested in for her grand kids. She brought us bagels as a thank you. Yummy. 4. A fan my FIL was trying to sell didn’t, so I kept if for our guest room. 5. My daughter and I did a fall deer painting class that was free at the library. I picked up 2 new to me puzzles while I was there. I dropped off 1 in return. Reply 1. Got my Covid shot today. I had already gotten a flu shot where I work, but they don’t have Covid vaccines. For that, I went to a CVS located inside a Target store. My Medicare card allowed me to get the shot free, no copayment, and I asked them about coupons; I’d read where some stores give you freebies for getting your vaccine with them. The pharmacist was just going to let me walk off without one, but since I spoke up, I got a coupon for $5 off a $20 purchase, good for 30 days. 2. We have new neighbors and they came and brought me some home-baked loaves of bread. He’s a home chef. 3. Signed up for more substitute teacher gigs. 4. Cut up more limbs and brush and put them out for garbage pickup. Hid them in 2 huge contractor’s bags which I put in the bottom of the regular trash can. Came home and they’re all gone….or at least THIS weekend’s batch was gone. Slowly but surely I am getting all the brush hauled off without paying the landfill fee to dump them. City Garbage Dept. only picks up brush twice monthly, so I have to get creative about disposing of same. 5. Went to the bank to check on my finances. All is well. Reply 1. Many years ago I gave my niece and her husband a dresser when they were first starting out as newlyweds. 12 years later she offered to give it back. I accepted as I have been saving to buy a new dresser for my new primary bedroom which will be in my addition, which isn’t quite finished. So now I can use that money elsewhere. 2. My cousin who lives on a nearby island had me over for two days, taking me out for dinner one night (which was lovely) and cooking for me one night (also lovely). He picked me up from the ferry terminal so I didn’t have to pay for my car. I also have a discount card for the ferry which saved me about $4. We went for a walk to a beautiful beach and had a picnic lunch from leftovers, some of which I had brought from home. It was a wonderful mini vacation for me. 3. Dh managed to remove two bathroom windows (without breaking them) which we can now sell. 4. Picking my own dahlias for a bouquet to decorate my Airbnb cottage whenever I have guests. 5. Gave my friend’s 88 year old mother some kale and cherry tomatoes out of my garden, and she gave me a jar of her strawberry jam. Reply 1. While doing some citizen science collecting water at a creek, found $8 in loonies ($1 coins) and twoonies ($2 coins). Took all but one, as they were sitting on a rock in the middle of a creek that was going to flood the next day. Whoot, $7 for the found money jar that I didn’t have until now. The next day, when back for another citizen science collection, I noted that the coin was gone, although the water hadn’t yet risen that far. It will be a mystery to me why those coins were there in that lovely neat pile. (down a very slick steep route – not a path, more like a slide, hold on to trees and hope you don’t misstep. Who would GO down there?) 2. Made fajitas with chicken legs I had cooked in the instant pot (bones back in the pot for broth), and discount purple and yellow peppers, as well as a couple of sad onions. I have made up a spice mix that saves me time when making mexican food, so the meal came together quickly with rice from a discount bag bought (ahem) a while ago. Homemade tomatillo salsa and some tortillas I had picked up on discount, I was in heaven. 3. Had a not-frugal 4 days as I flew a long way up north in my province to ask for signatures so that my political party will have a candidate in that riding for the upcoming provincial election. After two full days of talking to a LOT of very nice people, I successfully collected the required number of signatures (went out for insurance signatures, just in case) and completed the applicaiton with 1/2 day to spare. I am now the ‘paper’ candidate in that riding â where I have not a hope of being elected, due to some pretty divisive politics up there, however people who are looking for an alternative to the big two will have a choice on their ballots. Democracy for the win! (kind of…). My flight and hotel and car rental were paid, and I was very careful with the meals I purchased to save the party money â the hotel had a very good breakfast for free so I ate well in the morning then did without until evening. So glad to be home, though. 4. As mentioned in a comment above, I harvested a LOT of winter squash with the help of a young friend. It was SO much fun, and a lot of work â my lawn tractor trailer was full 4 times! I lent a pickup truck bed’s worth of squash to another young friend who needed them for his work (they were doing a photo-shoot) and I gave him two huge stalks of multiple sunflowers when he came over â might as well share them when they are perfect, eh? The remainder of the squash were washed with the help of Wonder James, and put into my grow room, resting on Bread Trays for air flow and under lights for curing. (best gardening hack â old bread trays are useful for so many things) 5. Got a huge load of firewood delivered (not frugal), and while Wonder James was stacking it in the woodshed/hayshed, he had to temporarily pull out the haybales. He came and knocked on my door with his shirt front bulging out â he had found a hidden chicken nest, and presented me with 18 eggs! GAH. Then, when I went out to check on things, I saw that he hadn’t brought in the nest I knew about (another 16 eggs) and THEN he started pulling eggs from between two bales. I think I have 8 dozen ‘found and questionable’ eggs! The birds had been suddenly unproductive about 2 weeks ago, so now I know where they were laying, instead…ANYWAY, I am using these eggs by washing them, ensuring they are lying flat while in the water (indication of age, if they float one end up they are older. Not BAD per-se, but older)/ Any ‘good’ ones I am breaking one-by-one into a small bowl before using, and they are all fine. The dog gets the partial floaters, if there are any. I am researching frozen quiches… 6. Oh, and if I haven’t mentioned it, I am now a grandmother of a lovely little boy â born August 30th. Was a last minute caesarian, so Mom and Dad were in a bit of shock, however this kiddo is just about the easiest baby one could imagine, so they are having a break there as mom recovers (and struggles with some issues). Both Mom and Dad caught covid, so I haven’t seen the baby for a week, hope to change that tomorrow, now that I am back from my travels Reply Congratulations Grandma!! Reply Fair play to you for spreading the plant love! 5 frugal things: * The cauliflower in Lidl has a price per piece and there just happened to be a piece in the box that was double the size of all the others so I did of course buy that very one! ð There was enough for a side dish for one evening and for cauliflower cheese soup for the day after. * I attended several free talks as part of a local festival. * Somehow managed to rip my pants on the car and promptly mended them. * Found a beautiful handmade pottery dish and set it aside for the Christmas presents stash. * The teens declared a packet of grapes that I had gotten as “too soft” so I suggested they freeze the grapes and have them as a frozen snack. They didn’t love them but they ate them! Reply fwiw, I was curious and clicked on your Fetch referral link but it didn’t work for me: “app_not_found.” Thanks for all your frugal five posts, Katy. Wishing a very speedy continued recovery for your mom… Reply @Dmarie, I had the same problem, thought it was ’cause I am in Canada? Reply I just tried it and had the same problem and Iâm in Colorado Reply 1. I mentioned getting a chest freezer in the last edition of 5 frugal things…but didn’t elaborate. It was $199 from a local grocery store and the store added $199 worth of coupons for free items to my account. Lots of snacks/treats…ice cream, pizza rolls etc. 2. I grabbed a gift for a birthday party from my “gift closet” – it was a board/card game I had gotten for free after a rebate. I put it in a recycled gift bag and used recycled tissue paper also. & My son made his friend a card. 3. I got a free jar of mayo from the local grocery store. It’s not something we’ll eat, so we’ll donate it to my son’s flag football food drive next week. 4. I have my bi-annual mammogram later today. Yesterday afternoon I got a call from my doctor’s office asking if I want to have my visit directly after the mammogram to save myself another trip to their office in a few weeks. Yes please! 5. I have a book on hold at the library that was recommended to me for my son (who is a history buff) Reply Leave a Comment Name * E-mail * Website Previous post: Five Frugal Things Get smart with the Thesis WordPress Theme from DIYthemes.

Title: Why Amazon’s Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T12:00:00Z

Amazon's return-to-work mandate threatens trust, collaboration and workplace culture. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week called all of the company’s employees back to the office five days a week, part of an effort to preserve the company’s culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand — hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest. Amazon’s decision isn’t just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It’s actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that’s seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance. And leaders know this full well. PWC’s Invesco Dynamic Market ETF 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don’t feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty. This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised “new normal”–a clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways–together. But this vision has stalled–with whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon’s actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we’re all going to lose if the battle continues. To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices. This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization—replacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity. As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment–to the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, “what do we owe each other?” What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies–taking productivity and profits to the grave. In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to “strengthen” a face-to-face culture, where “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be? Culture has come to loosely mean “how I like to work.” For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy’s frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon’s culture as “toxic,” a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it’s the how, not the where. It’s about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it’s tough, it’s not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it’s at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it’s just another pawn in the workplace power struggle. The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It’s time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year — Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) — none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. “With the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,” JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. “The political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,” he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. © 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: JPM reiterates Okta stock at Neutral following investor meeting

On Monday, JPMorgan reiterated its Neutral rating on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:OKTA) with a steady price target of $105.00. The firm's commentary followed a virtual investor meeting held last week in Asia with Okta's SVP of Investor Relations, Dave Gennarelli. The discussions covered a range of topics including the identity market, Okta's growth prospects, long-term potential, competitive dynamics, and recent events such as the FBI raid on Carahsoft. "The company continues to take a thoughtful approach toward building a competitive platform while balancing necessary investments with profitability," said JPMorgan analysts in a note. In other recent news, Okta Inc . has seen adjustments in its financial outlook following its second-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. The company reported a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $646 million, primarily due to a 17% rise in subscription revenue. However, Okta's third-quarter calculated remaining performance obligations (cRPO) guidance fell short of projections. Analyst firms such as Piper Sandler and Canaccord Genuity adjusted their price targets for Okta to $100 and $90, respectively. In contrast, BMO Capital Markets raised its price target to $103, citing Okta's robust growth in remaining performance obligations. Deutsche Bank lowered its price target for Okta's shares to $115 while maintaining a Buy rating. To complement JPMorgan's analysis, recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context on Okta's financial position and market performance. Despite the company's focus on balancing investment and profitability, InvestingPro data shows that Okta was not profitable over the last twelve months, with an adjusted operating income of -$228 million. However, the company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 75.82%, reflecting strong pricing power in its identity management offerings. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Okta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it navigates market challenges and invests in growth. Additionally, 31 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting a potentially positive outlook that aligns with JPMorgan's steady price target. It's worth noting that Okta's stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -29.28%. This decline might present an opportunity for investors, as the RSI suggests the stock is in oversold territory.

According to the company's preliminary data, approximately 99.89% of the outstanding public warrants were exercised for cash at $11.50 per share of Class A common stock. This led to the exercise of 13,581,996 public warrants, leaving only 260,987 unexercised as of the redemption date. The final results of the redemption will be confirmed after the broker protect period expires on October 1, 2024. Following this redemption, AST SpaceMobile has no public warrants outstanding. The redemption follows an announcement made on August 28, 2024, in which AST SpaceMobile stated its intention to redeem these warrants as per the Warrant Agreement from September 13, 2019. The public warrants have ceased trading and were delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with the trading suspension taking effect on September 27, 2024. The company's Class A common stock continues to be traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "ASTS."

In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile has made substantial progress with its satellite launch and financial growth.

These satellites are designed to provide cellular broadband speeds directly to mobile phones, with an aim to deliver non-continuous coverage across the United States and selected global markets. In addition to this, the company's stockholders approved the 2024 Incentive Award Plan, aligning the interests of service providers with shareholders. This development comes alongside Deutsche Bank's significant increase in the price target for AST SpaceMobile, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock.

AST SpaceMobile's recent warrant redemption aligns with its ambitious plans to develop a space-based cellular broadband network. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at $7.16 billion, reflecting investor optimism about its potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that ASTS holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it pursues its innovative technology. This strong cash position is particularly crucial given the capital-intensive nature of space-based communications projects. The company's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a 773.1% price total return over the past six months. This surge aligns with the growing interest in space-based technologies and the potential disruption of traditional telecommunications. However, investors should note that ASTS is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income of $238.34 million in the last twelve months. The InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts do not anticipate profitability this year underscores the long-term nature of the company's ambitious projects. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for ASTS, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault—and the raft of plush brands he oversees—seem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault’s fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business’s stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH’s share price bounced 14% from €617.50 to €703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault’s fortunes—after all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion—leapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world’s richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini—the CEO of Moncler—and one of the brand’s largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH’s influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: “The luxury consumer is all shopped out.” It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ position—the same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. “‘Quiet luxury’ has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,” the group wrote. “The industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at €1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).” And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Exploding sales of prescription weight loss medications have catapulted Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to become the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies. This relentless demand has not only led to ongoing shortages but also boosted Denmark’s GDP last year. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts project that the global market for GLP-1 prescription drugs could reach $105 billion by 2030. With so much money at stake, a range of companies — Costco (COST) among them — have begun offering these weight loss medications. Additionally, telehealth companies including Hims & Hers (HIMS) and Ro are also providing lower-cost, off-brand alternatives. And even a Kardashian has joined the fray with a supplement that taps into the hype. Check out these companies and others that have entered the weight loss market this year. 2 / 8 Ro was one of the first telehealth companies to start selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand and cheaper version of the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/metas-swot-analysis-aidriven-growth-fuels-stock-optimism-93CH-3638852

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) Reports Strong August Sales, Considers Mega Chip Factory Partnership with Samsung in UAE

We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs. The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. The company posted August sales numbers earlier this month, revealing that revenue for the month came in at approximately $7.8 billion, up 33% from August 2023. JP Morgan highlighted the strong sales in August for the chipmaker and suggested the global foundry could surpass third-quarter guidance. Latest reports suggest that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is mulling plans to partner with electronics giant Samsung to build mega chip factories in the United Arab Emirates. These factories would help satisfy soaring demand for artificial intelligence computing, per The Wall Street Journal. Overall TSM ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Indian stock market witnessed a sharp sell-off on Monday, with the BSE Sensex plummeting 1,272.07 points or 1.49 per cent to close at 84,299.78, while the Nifty 50 tumbled 368.10 points or 1.41 per cent to 25,810.85.

The rupee depreciated 11 paise to settle at 83.80 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, taking cues from equity markets that saw a steep fall of over 1 per cent amid volatile crude oil prices and outflow of foreign funds.

Market Performance So Far: The USD/JPY pair has been under scrutiny since Shigeru Ishiba’s election as Japan’s new prime minister, with a drop of over 400 pips reflecting the market’s anticipation of potential policy shifts. Currently, the pair appears to be in a period of consolidation after the sharp decline, with traders focusing on the 144.30 level for signs of bearish price action. The market is still digesting Ishiba’s election and its broader implications, and traders may hesitate to make moves until more concrete policy direction is provided by the new government. Meanwhile, the broader USDX is showing mixed signals, having made a new weekly low on Friday, with traders eyeing this as a potential buying opportunity. The 99.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, and if the dollar index dips to this point, it could trigger a bullish reversal, especially if market sentiment turns in favor of the USD amid perceived risks stemming from Japan’s new foreign policy initiatives. In terms of the EUR/USD, there is a strong chance the pair could drop further from its current area, with a possibility of making one final push higher before retreating. Traders looking at bullish price action around the 1.1100 or 1.1040 zones may find opportunities, but the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in the near term. GBP/USD is showing a similar pattern, with the potential for the pair to either come down from its current area or make one more push higher before reversing. If it does rise, the 1.3500 level becomes a key resistance point, and bearish price action around this zone will likely set the tone for the following week. However, if the pair declines sooner, the 1.3300 level could provide a solid area for a bullish reaction, offering some short-term opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on volatility. Lastly, gold has continued its downward movement after testing resistance at 2670, with a potential consolidation expected, and bullish price action around the 2590 area could set the stage for a rebound. What’s Happening This Week: As we head into the first week of October, several key economic data points are expected to drive market movements. On Monday, Germany’s Preliminary CPI data is forecasted to come in at 0.1%, following a previous reading of -0.1%, which could influence the EUR/USD pair. On Tuesday, the focus shifts to high-impact U.S. reports, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 47.6, and the JOLTS Jobs Opening report, with 7.64 million jobs forecasted. A weaker-than-expected JOLTS report could fuel speculation that the U.S. job market is softening, adding pressure to the dollar. On Wednesday, the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change takes center stage, with a forecast of 124K jobs added, and traders will be watching closely to see whether the actual data meets expectations. A stronger-than-expected ADP figure could reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, while a weaker figure could lead to dollar weakness. On Thursday, the ISM Services PMI is forecasted at 51.6, and any data supporting a strong U.S. services sector will likely reinforce dollar strength. The end of the week brings the most closely watched reports: Friday’s Non-Farm Employment Change and the Unemployment Rate. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data is forecasted at 144K, and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A stronger-than-expected NFP report, combined with a stable unemployment rate, could drive the dollar higher, while a weaker NFP could lead to dollar softness. Markets will likely respond with heightened volatility around Friday’s release, making it an important day for traders in dollar-denominated assets. Welspun Corp announced the receipt of order from the Middle East for supply of Coated LSAW Pipes and Bends for sour service. Shares rise 1.77% on the NSE to ₹753.60. Here is the Live event updates Market is likely to move into a consolidation phase in the near-term. One significant factor that is influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of the Chinese stocks which is reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 % in September. This surge has been triggered by hopes of revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can prove to be a tactical trade which can sustain for some more time. This means FIIs may continue to sell in India and move some more money to better performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling. Investors can use dips to buy quality largecaps which are fairly valued. Crude oil prices recovered from their lows on Friday but prices fell last week amid demand concerns and higher supply from global oil markets. As per market sources, OPEC+ will increase production by 1,80,000 barrels per day each month starting from December. The Libyan dispute has also settled and its exports could resume soon. Also, the Chinese central bank announced a cut in RRR by 50 basis points and undertook stimulus measures to revive the Chinese economy thus supporting crude oil prices at lower levels. Escalating tensions in the Middle-East are also supporting crude oil prices. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile in today’s session. Crude oil is having support at $67.55-66.90 and resistance at $69.10-69.80. In INR, crude oil has support at Rs5,630-5,570 while resistance is at Rs 5,775-5,840. Gold and silver prices rose for the third straight week in the global market after the U.S. Fed undertook big interest rate cuts in September. The dollar also weakened, which helped push prices higher. However, both metals dropped slightly from their record highs as some investors sold to book profits. Gold is nearing $2,700 per troy ounce, and silver recently hit its highest level in 11 years. Gold and silver are gaining strength because of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world, stimulus efforts from China, and rising global tensions. Gold has support at $2651-2640 while resistance is at $2684-2699. Silver has support at $31.42-31.24 while resistance is at 31.87-32.05. In INR terms, gold has support at Rs 74,750-74,570, while resistance is at Rs 75,190-75,380. Silver has support at Rs90,850-90,150, while resistance at Rs91,990-92,680.

The latest relaxation is part of slew of changes now implemented by SEBI to its existing SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014. We zoom in on the prospects of Rajesh Exports, as also the prospects of two other stocks — Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Mishtann Foods The dollar index oscillated up and down within a narrow range all through last week. The index traded in a range of 100.16-101.23. The immediate outlook is unclear. However, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release on Friday can keep the bias negative. The US 10Yr Treasury yield has declined on Friday following this data release. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crest Ventures, Exide Industries and NMDC At current P/B multiple of 7.2 times, the price has already pulled forward many years of potential growth in net worth and the risk-reward of holding the stock at current levels is not favourable As record inflows via the SIP route continue and retail investor preference surges for mutual funds as long-term vehicles, asset management companies (AMCs) remain among the key beneficiaries. Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is the fourth largest private bank in India. Over the years, it has been a good all-round performer in all three key aspects – balance sheet growth, asset quality and margins. However, now a host of challenges such as the embargo on the issue of new credit cards and a resultant drop in NIM, dropping CASA ratio and signs of stress in credit card accounts are stacked up for the management to overcome.
